"Arrow","2017-11-10"," This show is ridiculous and unconvincing  Dialogues are awful, acting is bad and the script is insulting viewer's intelligence  Mother's secrets could have been a great show for itself and are, along with the island flashbacks the only reason I'm still watching  The bad guys and villains aren't scary at all, action scenes aren't exciting, some of the actors have a charisma of a cooked octopus when they're trying to be tough; that's actually funny from time to time  Absolutely the worst part are the relations between characters driven by kindergarten dialogues which are embarrassing to watch and listen  ",1,-0.6,1,"Negative"
"Arrow","2017-11-10"," This was one of the best TV shows you watch for comic book genre, It started of great well lit up scenes with loads of action, suspense and a good story-line, suddenly all of that was thrown out and made a weak series in which the main character reveals himself all the time and the action is terrible to watch, no suspense, no general direction of the character, in almost every episode its the same dialogue  Oliver if you want them to trust you, you should let them know who you are, and Oliver takes of his eye piece and says  I am the Green Arrow  L O L What Dafuq The show is just going down hill, specially that now the main character is now Felicity (sleeps with all the Billionaires and take their fortune and keeps them under her payroll) worst character, Thea Queen 2nd billionaire famous line  I am out   Just keep the group small and the action hardcore like 1st season, identity reveal yeah stop that, let the character start killing again, and please don't bring dead people back to make their own show Season 1 - Great  Season 2 - Just OK  Season 3 - What is happening Season 4 - Why are you killing the show  Season 5 - I give up, cant watch anymore  Season 6 - Stopped watching  ",7,0.3,7.3,"Positive"
"Arrow","2017-11-07"," The action of Arrow is awesome! but i feel that it has become a little boring because there is absolutely no humor, Felicity talks too much, and many other flaws  Thats why i give it a 4/10 rating  Otherwise, the series' action is perfect #Flashfan ",4,-0.2,3.8,"Negative"
"Arrow","2017-11-03"," This show is amazing and it gets better each day   Season 6 is spectacular  This is the best DCTV show in the Arrowverse  The show matures and grows each year   The leads of the show are spectacular and their chemistry is legendary   Great cast   Great story  Got a hold of this show last year and if I had blindly followed the haters remarks online, I would not have tried to check it out on my own   Guess what ?

"Arrow","2017-10-27"," I really loved this show at first but its become very hit and miss as to weather an episode is any good or not  It started out great (8/10) it was kinda dark and ruthless but unfortunately the writers started emphasizing on the characters feelings way too much  Also the fight scenes although slightly better now became super cheesy and felt like I was watching power rangers around season 4 I really hope that they start focusing more on the villains and plot more again  Also it definitely wouldn't bother me if they killed off most of the annoying cast members  ",6,-1.3,4.7,"Negative"
"Arrow","2017-10-27"," The First Season Of Arrow is a Great Season, it doesn't even feel like a superhero show (in a good way) the action scenes and flash backs are great and look like a scene from Mission Impossible or Kingsmen! The villain is top notch, the emotion is there, absolute greatness  Sure, it stalls here and there but that's expected when you have to fill 23 hours  the first season is great 8 75/10 IMOThe second is best so far, Deathstroke is the best villain, other than him the villain of the week's are also great e g  the doll maker and clock king  the flash backs are also the greatest 9 5/10 IMOthe third season is where things go downhill, till the mid season it was shaping up to be great but after  The Climb  It became really mediocre, Ra's AL ghoul was an okay villain and the finale was really anti climatic  6/10 IMOThe fourth is the worst  there is realistic feel to it, Damien Dahrk is a magician while Oliver is only an archer/hand to hand fighter  Thus the stakes are raised too high also Schism is the second worst episode ever  5/10 IMOThe fifth season is a revival and is the second best season, Prometheus is a phenomenal villain and the stakes have been taken down a notch (THANK GOD) the finale is the best episode ever of Arrow, the only bad episode was  Underneath  and its quite possibly the WORST EPISODE TOO  9/10 IMOoverall you will have a blast with the first two seasons, will have to sit through the bore that is season 3 and 4 and will be hooked at season 5, HIGH HOPES FOR SEASON 6 ",8,0.5,8.5,"Positive"
"Arrow","2017-10-21"," Like with Smallville and The Flash I have not seen every single episode but on some occasions, I do watch this show but only when there is a crossover or a certain actor in a particular episode  Like Peter Stormare who did good acting as Count Vertigo for two episodes and Matt Ryan who was John Constantine for one episode which was very funny  I also think Stephen Amell did great as Green Arrow and Felicity Smoke is pretty hot like Cathlin Snow from The Flash is  It is an okay show but it is not as interesting or likable as The Flash or Smallville  ",6,0.4,6.4,"Positive"

"Arrow","2017-10-10"," The first 2 seasons of the show was amazing however after that it got stale and boring  I decided to give up less than half way through season 5  The flashbacks become uninteresting  The villains after 2 seasons are boring  Love story is soap opera material  Season 4 made the show unrealistic with the sci-fi magic  Arrow was more interesting when he was working alone without any sidekicks  ",5,0,5,"Negative"
"Arrow","2017-10-04"," The first two seasons of Arrow were brilliantly done  The cinematography was illuminating, and it had a good plot  Somewhere along the line, though, the writing went south, and I know where we can point a finger to: Marc Guggenheim  It's bad enough that he killed off Laurel, but apparently, he wants another to take up the mantle  Rather than giving it to her Earth 2 counterpart, like any ordinary writer does, he gives it to a character named Tina Boland, whose real name is apparently Dinah Drake  Never mind that the real Dinah actually appeared before, and that she was Laurel's mother! I swear, I don't know how in the world these writers are able to find jobs  They suck at it  Then there's the Felicity relationship  Not a bad character, but when you focus on shipping these two together, when clearly, within the comic books, Green Arrow and Black Canary are an item from day one! And she constantly makes some of the most bone headed plays, yet Oliver never calls her out for it  He's such a wuss  He's not Green Arrow  Green Arrow is funny, witty and doesn't mope around  Stephen Amell is a good actor, but they should have stopped the whole Batman persona around Season Two or Three  They had a chance to make things right with Season Four, yet they come away from that one even worse  And they didn't even know who was going to end up in the grave  Really? You threw the grave plot line out there, without knowing WHO was going to end up in it? To this day, I still say William, Oliver's son, should have been the one who died  This would have made his fight against Damien Darhk much more personal  In fact, who wouldn't have wanted him to die? John Barrowman is a good actor, but they've lost all use for him  Oliver's excuses for letting him live fall flat when he sold out his son in exchange for protection  To me, that's unforgivable  I'm sorry, writers, but you have failed this show  If you want to keep me interested, fire the show-runners  Better yet, cancel the show, before you make things much worse  ",7,-0.2,6.8,"Positive"
"Arrow","2017-09-29"," From the first season I thought that this show was unique and had a lot of promise; it was full of intrigue and frustrating characters who seemed to be neither good or bad in a way contrasting to so many superhero films/series  To say how much I enjoyed the show in the first and second seasons I was thoroughly disappointed from there in and yet I stuck around for two more seasons  The worst things about the show was how repetitive the villains became and how easily supposedly dead cast members were somehow brought back to life  I just wish this show had finished at it's peak after season two! ",6,-0.5,5.5,"Negative"
"Arrow","2017-08-11"," I used to think Arrow was a great show until the first episode of season 3,that was when the show went downhill in my opinion I first like seeing a dark version of the popular archer Green Arrow from DC Comics and seeing popular characters that were supporting characters of Green Arrow come to life in the Green Arrow's own dark story which seemed pretty interesting for the first two seasons But when the show had it's season 3 premiere and it introduced Ra's al Ghul and more stories similar to other Batman stories started to be on the show,that's when the Green Arrow of the cw started to feel more like a parody and Felicity,his main love interest on The CW started to feel like her getting paralyzed and being named Overwatch was stolen from the story of how Batgirl/Barbara Gordon got paralyzed and got the nickname Oracle and fell in love with Batman And I still can't believe the writers didn't mind killing of the Black Canary in season 4,who is the real main love interest of the Green Arrow and not Felicity Smoak  ",1,0.2,1.2,"Negative"
"Arrow","2017-08-11"," The action scenes are excellent and the story line if you are fan of super heroes in comics but the relationships between them are like the bold and the beautiful!like an American or Turkish soap opera!!!so beautiful faces with so boring personalities!!laurel??pffffff so predictable and flat as a woman!only felicity keeps the level up OK it is not game of thrones to have complexity in the characters but why so flat feelings?? P S are we serious???im in season 2 and it's getting worse the romance part is awful soryyyy I mean stupid!!are the comics like this???mr director please this is not a soap opera!! PS2 at the end season 2 was much better and the love story between felicity and arrow seems the only real one!i hope to continue like this!!manu Bennett great performance as in Spartacus,he is a great actor he made season 2 more interesting PS 3 I quit watching at season 4   it could be a good show but unfortunately the script and the production are poor and in the soap opera's level   that's why I lowered my review to 4/10 What a pity :( ",4,0.7,4.7,"Negative"
"Arrow","2017-07-27"," I love superhero movies   I mean love em   I love Marvel and DC movies I do not have a favorite between the two I just love em both  I haven't read any comic books so I have to research origin stories and stuff  With that being said  The TV shows are a very different, which is to be expected  I still like some of em very much  Well I can safely say I really like the Flash  It is expected that superheros shows are cheesy I mean come on   sometimes the cheese on top makes it better  With that being said Arrow is to cheesy for me   I binge watch every show I watch and I watch a lot of shows (quite a range of em)  The Flash, and Arrow do a lot of crossovers that is why I began watching Arrow so that I could follow that story line because of the cross overs  I am in to the 5th season and I just don't think I can I watch another a season  I will get through this one but my God! It is like the characters aren't growing at all  5 yrs in to the season and Oliver is still the same whining, brooding woe is me character he was in season 1  How can he be so pathetic and at the same time be so cocky to think every thing that happens in the universe is some how his doing? Who is he GOD? The constant self torment, it is like be the Arrow or don't already! Kill or stop  At the same time every freaking season Thea has to go find herself  She loses sight of who she really is every season, come on  Who is writing this crap? Can she please find herself and be good? It has been 5 years what is going on? Of course there are the canaries  Can they just die or freaking live already? It is sooo ridiculous the same story written every season The betrayals  How many times can Oliver MCQueen get betrayed by someone he trust before he learns to stop being an idiot? He is supposed to be the mayor and the Green Arrow protecting the city on two different fronts yet he is constantly trusting anyone who comes into his life and being played  Come on  A person has to have better instincts than that to run a city or be a super hero! This season with this new team!This new team is awful  I mean awful  There is literally 0 purpose for any of them to be with Oliver  They can't fight, they don't have any powers, their instincts suck  The only one that could do anything was the one with the suit that had power  Mr  Wonderful or whatever is good at tech stuff but who needs him when they have Felicity, except he is also good at being a punching bag  The Jason Voorhies want be is a terrible substitution for that other guy they had that Thea was dating (I am terrible at remembering names) I have started this season so I have to finish, but right now it is killing me  Every scene, and every episode so far is just so dumb  ",3,0.1,3.1,"Negative"
"Arrow","2017-07-21"," Arrow piloted in 2012  I loved the first season  Oliver Queen returns from his island he was stranded on and decides to fight crime because of his father and to make Star City better so he becomes the vigilante known as the Green Arrow  The first season was amazing and had a great plot  Stephen Amell had quality acting and the actors for Felicity, Diggle, and Laurel are all good  So I thought it wasn't going to get better  It got better  Season 2 was much darker and was highlighted by a new villain  It contained more quality acting and more Oliver flashback scenes  So after that I loved Arrow  But it didn't last  Season 3 wasn't necessarily terrible but it lost something about the first 2 seasons that made it great  It had a different vibe and it just didn't have a great plot  Season 4 gets too supernatural and season 4 is a low point for the series and I didn't enjoy it that much  I reluctantly watched season 5 which initially isn't great but by the end it recovers from season 4s problems  I would recommend this show but it's not perfect  It does have some weaknesses but it's a good show at its best ",8,0.3,8.3,"Positive"
"Arrow","2017-07-21"," I have watched four seasons, and this show has gone from great to fantastic! First of, I am not very familiar with the comic, but I have done some reading up post watching  The first season has a lot of introductions, explaining and character growth  The second and third season expands on this and while the good parts becomes better, the not so good parts starts to show more  Some say there is too much drama in the show, I say yes, there is drama, bu that makes the characters, motifs and bonds that much stronger any you get a real sense of what they are fighting for  By the end of the third season I felt like I was feed too much of an excellent meal, and really hoped there would be some changes until season four  I really got what I wished for! Oliver Queen finally starts to smile a lot more and leaves his previously troubled self behind  The chemistry between the characters is almost touchable and the fight scenes are simply amazing  Just watch episode 6 of season 4 for a great example  This particular shot just goes on and on without any cut  Simply breathtaking!Arrow is heavily tied to the Flash series so it is almost mandatory to watch them side by side in the right order  I personally don't mind this as I love Flash also  ",9,0.6,9.6,"Positive"
"Arrow","2017-07-06"," Arrow is just the show, you'd watch, when you are bored to death  Aside from that, this has the best background story, you'll ever experience from a life series  On the other hand, it gets milked by the present to an extent, where it just gets boring Judging by the book, the Author really made a poor job  The setting, acting and everything else was just so there was a barely standing hero-series  => Normal guy becomes hero, kills and arrests bad people and has all the women he wants => Bad people wanna kill him and the women, he looses the women  => Hero stops them  => Hero becomes hyped, kills and arrests more bad people and has all the women he wants Looping all the way to the end of the series This kind of reminds me of Superman mixed with Robin Hood and Batman Sure, there are some parts where I laughed and really got hyped by the next episode, but comparing to others, these moments were minor in arrow  As the 3rd Season started, I suddenly felt, why this series has such a bad reputation  Everything went viral, to complete confusion  The impression I got, worsened and kept its pace For everyone considering watching a mainstream Hero-Vigilante-RobinHood-Richguy-Series  Why not just watch arrow? Considering that: I dare you to watch past season 2  ",8,-0.6,7.4,"Positive"
"Arrow","2017-07-03"," If you're lucky you have yet to watch this horrible show  There is so much wrong with this show that I'm actually having trouble thinking of how/if I will present all the issues First off, even if this show was well written (which it most certainly isn't) it wouldn't show up on screen due to the human statues that are delivering the dialogue  Stephen Amell is an absolute board  Sure, he's good looking but come on CW, he's terrible! It's as if the casting directors went to the nearest Abercrombie and Fitch photo shoot and chose the best looking guy to be their lead! Secondly, am I the only one who thinks that characters must have strong motivation to change? If characters make huge decisions as a result of small events those decisions are seen as cheap and meaningless  This show is the cheapest of them all My third and final complaint (that I will list) is please stop recycling lines, it's gut churning Unless you like poking fun at terrible shows don't go near this one  ",1,0.1,1.1,"Negative"
"Arrow","2017-06-28"," Arrow is certainly the best DC superhero TV show along with Gotham  Features DC characters such as Green Arrow, Deathstroke (the best of the lot), Black canary and Felicity Smoak!! The reason why Arrow is better than many other shows such as Iron Fist is because of the whole flashback and present thing that goes on    the way in which the show is made is unique and that's the best part about the show!!The 1st season is watchable but then the 2nd season arrives which is amazingly awesome just because of a single character and that is none other than Deathstroke!!Watch this one    it's amazing!!

"Arrow","2017-06-22"," Arrow may be the worst superhero show on T V  Season 1 & 2 were good but after that it went down hill  The writing is terrible and the acting is worst  Everyone on the show is melodramatic  Everyone is so serious all the time  The writers constantly write the story into a corner and us The easy way out to fix the situation  Eventually everything become meaningless bc u know they will just take the easy way out  Ex: Magic pill , futuristic technology, dream sequel, secret twin and clones  etc  Plus the felicity can hack into literally anything in the world  She might actually be the strongest superhero in the show One of the main characters was shot and supposedly was  permanently  paralyzed then in like three episodes the character gets a magic chip or something installed in their spine to magically heal themselves  One fake out is okay but the show only consists of fake outs  To the point that it becames predictable  Nobody ever dies except the fact that they have fake killed off every character on the show  Every arrow episode ever : actor 1 : I can't trust you  If u go ahead with your plan we can't be friends anymore  Actor 2: I have to  By the end of the episode problem is resolved and the gang is back together  Rinse and repeat ",2,0.1,2.1,"Negative"

"Arrow","2017-06-13"," I really liked this show up till the 3rd season  Then it seems it got infected with the SJW bug  Same goes for The Flash and Legends of Tomorrow Every episode has some cultural marxist spin to it  They had an episode about gun controlled that was so flawed it sounded like a twelve year old wrote it  They didn't think people should be allowed to by an AR-15  At the same time he has dozens of M-4's in his secret layer and two of the heroes go around shooting people every episode  The idea that the criminal mafia's and gangs would stop using guns if they were illegal is just one example of why they need to fire the writers  There is numerous episodes in which the women make sexist comments towards men  Of course the men just have to apologize for being born male  SJW's have destroyed movies, video games, and TV shows  There needs to be a great purge in the media and entertainment industries  ",1,-0.1,1,"Negative"
"Arrow","2017-06-02"," I have always really enjoyed arrow but I will admit the last couple of seasons were weaker so I am happy to say that season 5 Is a real return to form for the show  The premise of the season sees oliver queen attempt to train a new team of vigilantes in an attempt to stopping a serial killer while trying to be star city's mayor during the day  Stephen amell is oliver queen and he is absolutely fantastic in this role, he totally nails the character and you really empathise with him  At times his character goes through hard times and he totally sells the anguish that he goes through so well and this is probably his best season for a dramatic performance  The supporting cast is used better this time, felicity smoak played by Emily bett Rickards becomes a lot less annoying this season and was used perfectly in her role so she didn't take over the show like I believe she has in previous seasons  Out of the new team I really liked rick Gonzalez take on wild dog and once you learn more about his back story you really do sympathise with him and care about him  David Ramsey is once again back as john diggle and even though he has slightly less to do this season he does a great job in the role especially contrasting Oliver  Prometheus is the villain of the season and I really liked his character, he is a dark reflection of oliver and once his big reveal happens it is even better as you see these two character's going head to head  The story of the season is well done seeing oliver forming these new relationships with people and learning to trust them  Also as mentioned before I feel like the villain fed into the narrative very well and did the job well  Also I actually kind of liked the flashback storyline this season, don't get me wrong it's not as good as the first two seasons but it is pretty fun to watch  The script is really good because this is the darkest of the dctv shows so it's drama is heavily relied upon and I thought really well handled  When the humour is needed it also is done pretty well to help break the tension  The style like most seasons of arrow has great action scenes that feel very gritty and real that sucks you into it, I also really enjoyed the links to the first season that is a big theme of this season  However, my one criticism of this season is that there are a few filler episodes around the half way mark that deviate from the main plot and I didn't enjoy it as much  This is a truly fantastic season of arrow that includes possibly my favourite finale of any of the seasons and the whole season is a must watch for comic book fans  ",9,1,10,"Positive"

"Arrow","2017-05-10"," Before The Flash, I started the Arrowverse with well, this  And certainly my initial impression for the 1st season was highly positive It is true even in the comics that Green Arrow was Batman with bow and arrows, but through the decades it has it's own nuances  While Oliver Queen's character and motivation isn't as compelling as Bruce Wayne, Ollie became a relevant figure in the DC Universe 4 seasons in and this is where I believe the show succeeds; Arrow the TV show wasn't trying to copy Batman even though on the surface it seemed the same; it tried to be it's own thing and that it works (most of the time and where it counts anyway )The show does have flaws particularly with regards to the writing on Oliver Queen's love life which is just distracting  I think this is due to the lack of motivation in Oliver Queen's character, something that even the comic book struggles with, so I can close an eye on it But also due to this, the direction of the show can lose focus at times and not as well paced as it should be  Again, the writers are simply working with what they have and that's not a whole lot compared to the Flash, which is why you will also see some borrowed villains from established Rogue Galleries  The real tragedy here is that while the writers have done a good job in presenting an often forgotten DC hero to a new audience, they haven't been able to build new ground on existing Green Arrow foundation which admittedly, isn't an easy task But in all intents and purposes, they've succeeded in making Arrow relevant again and that should congratulated  ",7,0,7,"Positive"

"Arrow","2017-01-27"," Don't get me wrong, I enjoy Arrow  But I can't love it  I'm a comic fan, not so much Arrow or most mainstream titles  I love the heroines, and this is where my gripe is  I'm a massive Batgirl fan and i mean all things Batgirl  Birds of Prey second favorite  ( The birds of prey generally consist of  Batgirl, Huntress, Black Canary) many more have filled in as well(Katana, poison Ivy for examples)  I also collect Black Canary  The Arrow give's no respect to Dinah Lance (the black canary)  In the real Dc universe, the black canary is considered as one the best and feared martial artists, to such a degree that she holds her own against Batman and most hero's or villains for that matter, and has beaten Arrow more than once, and would take any character on that show  Earth 2 Canary is what most books are based on   So when I see Felicity Joke being able to knock her out in 1 hit, it make's me wonder if the writers of Arrow even know about the characters they portray  The few episodes they had Huntress(Helena Bertinelli) Who's Batman's and Selina Kyle's daughter also from Earth 2   Show's they just love throwing any characters in without any real thought (Mad dog, Mr terrific   Absolute Joke's) It's like portraying Captain America with a bazooka instead of his shield  Please start showing more respect for the great characters you portray     ",6,0.4,6.4,"Positive"
"Arrow","2017-01-25"," This is one of my favourite TV shows of all time  At first, I was skeptical, and only watched it because I was watching Legends, and didn't get a few things  But I am glad I did watch  The first two seasons were bloody brilliant, a perfect ten out of ten  I loved the characters and the plots, and eagerly awaited each episode  Season three was a bit disappointing, at least some of it  The first ten episodes were good, Roy being the Arsenal was bloody brilliant, and I personally loved the new characters of Ray Palmer and Maseo  Yet the entire plot of Oliver becoming Ra's was pretty disappointing though  Season four was just bad  Really the only things I enjoyed in it were the Olicity moments, which in the end ruined the season  Season five has looked promising so far  The only problem I have is that Team Arrow is overcrowded, but I do like the new team  Prometheus is awesome, and it's been a pretty epic ride so far, and I'm looking forward to plenty more  ",9,0.4,9.4,"Positive"
"Arrow","2017-01-21"," !!! This may contain spoilers !!! I will try to avoid spoilers but just in case    (because I hate spoilers myself)  We try to find shows that already have seasons out because we binge-watch and I hate waiting for episodes  We started Arrow late last year and just finished season 4  I agree with several other reviewers about the first two seasons; great! We were hooked through he first two seasons  On that I have to give it a 9  It started going downhill on season 3 If you ever want to enjoy any of these action shows, you simply have to just ignore a certain amount of technical BS  The realities of physics and  it just doesn't work like that  that producers seem to ignore  The thing is that most of us with any sort of technical knowledge have to suffer through producers stupidity, but there comes a point when it becomes so bad that you just cant get past it  Who was it that said;  Truth is stranger than fiction because fiction has to make sense ? Arrow showed promise until there became more and more times I had to ignore stupid decisions from supposedly smart people and the all-to-common trauma to a persons body that you just don't recover from  Another reviewer complained; how do the arrows not come out of the quiver when he flips? that is ridiculous  I could easily design a quiver to hold the arrows -and there may be already some out there  However he also asked how it's possible Arrow pulls out exactly the tip he needs automatically with no apparent choosing? That is a valid question and is one of those things we are forced to overlook  Remember Hawkeye's revolving tip selector in Avengers? Excellent way to address that Our family started criticizing the show at first for the stupid decisions, The fight scenes became noticeably amateurish and very poorly choreographed  I'm sorry but bringing people back from the dead (I'm talking dead and decomposing)is crossing the line for us  The show just went from being a great super hero action show, and turned into a soap opera complete with shoving gays in the face of my kids  Another thing is consistency  It started out that Arrow had some mad skills and would shoot weapons out of the hands of criminals  He did not hesitate  But it seamed the greater the villain, The more he lost that ability and everyone seamed to stand with there thumbs you-know-where (hesitating I guess for effect)as the villain performed his bad deeds  Too many opportunities were missed to keep you in the mindset that they were skilled operators Season three was just questionable for us (like a 5 rating), but season four just completely went off the chain with soap opera, lousy fight scenes, stupid decisions and God-like powers leaving us feeling like we've been duped again, sucked in with a good show to hook you so you will sit through their psychotic thinking that they want to shove down your throat Stop after season two and you will still think it's a good show  Three and four are just down in the gutter  I hope this is informative for you  ",5,-0.8,4.2,"Negative"
"Arrow","2017-01-18"," Before I begin my review, If you are interested in watching the flash / arrow or if you watched the flash  Arrow is the perfect option  It's such a good show full of twists when turns, plot twists and nail-biting moments  If you are deciding whether to watch flash or arrow first I would definitely say arrow as there are spoilers in flash regarding arrow  But this show is a great one  There is barely any humour it is more based on action scenes and intense moments with very view funny moments as the show revolves around a Arrow and him stopping criminals  So in conclusion this show is a great one full of moments that will make you gasp and blow your mind, But if you are looking for a more light-hearted show, this isn't for you  Ahmed ",9,-0.3,8.7,"Positive"
"Arrow","2016-12-20"," I was thrilled with the first two seasons even considering one of my favorite shows  I love the story and the action was entertaining  The main villain Deathstroke was a great villain in both the season and I think he is the best actor in this whole show  But after starting the third season and watching the season, I can say that it is absolutely terrible  The acting and dialogue is on par with Disney channel shows  The plot is so mediocre and in points I was laughing so hard at some of the scenes  Not because they were funny but because they are so terrible  I was even excited because I heard the main villain was Ra's al Ghul  I thought this would be the best season yet, but no I don't want to finish the season  After watching the 2nd season of Daredevil and going to this, it's obvious which is the better show (Daredevil)  The positives I can give are the visuals and the villains are somewhat good  I questioned if I actually enjoyed the second season or if I was blind to good TV shows  The only reason I give this 4 stars is because the first two seasons are good and I would recommend you watch them both and skip the rest  ",4,0.6,4.6,"Negative"
"Arrow","2016-12-19"," I rated this show 5 out of 10  5 for being interesting to watch Season 1 and 2 but really went downhill from season 3 and 4  The plot was growing strong for the first 2 seasons but what annoyed me the most and made me want to quit this show was Laurel and Felicity 1) Laurel bitches way too much AND    2) Oliver has to put up with Laurel's nonsense and bitching after numerous times of being told not to do certain things which get them into trouble  3) Apparently anyone can be a superhero with just weeks of training  4) How does Laurel become the Black Canary when she only took boxing lessons? All of a sudden she has the courage to jump off 20 ft roof tops/ swing from buildings, grapple/kick, and learn mix martial arts in just a few weeks? I thought she was a freaken Lawyer man 5) Martial Arts acting really went downhill in season 3 and 4  6) Felicity and Oliver love scene? The show really made a thing of them two, did they run out of ideas that they went from saving the city for Oliver's dad to falling in love and revolving the show around Felicity? 7) and apparently Felicity can hack into anything at anytime  I am almost done with Season 4 but only continued because I don't want to binge a different show on Netflix while I am still on this one   Also, Thea is hot but also falls under those who learned how to fight in just a short amount of time    ",5,0,5,"Negative"
"Arrow","2016-12-19"," I can not but say that I am disappointed with this TV show  First season was quite awesome, all was fine, but then, it kinda lost its purpose and all was about making more money on action and action and action  I really dislike this  Good thing in this TV show was the start, the story, all was okay until some unreal things started to happen  Let me name all of those that I still remember: Oliver can do flips, rolls while no arrow ever fall out, Oliver knows exactly what arrow to take from his quiver even though most of them have different tip, he never draw his arrow first and then walk with it ready, instead, he walk with empty bow and then draws the arrow against several armed people who , as it seems, always miss him  How can a special forces team miss the guy with the arrow? The moment he moves his hand back to draw an arrow, special forces unit would kill him for sure in real life  OK, we get it, he is super fast archer even though it doesn't look like that  What else? He manages to kill the Ra's Al Ghul  This is so pathetic  Think about this, a leader of assassins talk to Oliver queen instead of simply killing him while he had a chance    That's so lame  Another crap moments were when unreal things started happening: Flash pops up, the CEO with super tech suit, Felicity who is obviously the master of everything and best hacker in the world  Please    If you want to watch this TV show, watch only first season, others are just NO  ",4,0.2,4.2,"Negative"
"Arrow","2016-10-24"," OK first off I like the show mind you but I mean they show him all messed up in first part but now he wasn't even on the darn island  All 5 years they have him all over the place so why in the heck he so homeless looking  The time-lines are getting on my nerves as well 5 months later 12 Min's early I'm like Jesus stop already Having said that he is a great arrow but some of cast selections really confused me  Plus now his new team I really don't like at all they need powers I say I wish they stick with one thing instead of jumping also to flash and other shows I mean can't flash do good on its own don't really need to show it the parts don't even have anything to do with the main story lines its just added stupid parts  ",4,0.2,4.2,"Negative"
"Arrow","2016-10-11"," I was skeptical about this series when I watched the 1st episode  I only continued to the next after watching the Flash's 1st episode where Arrow appeared with all his coolness  The following episodes were OK to watch doing something else in parallel, until I reached the 7th  There I was completely hooked and devoured everything including 3rd season, as soon as I could  The problems I had was with those annoying flashbacks  Even if there were some interesting stories, the past is the past and it is useless to cover half of the episode just to tell us how he learned to fight and make enemies  Still the action was interesting and the drama (when it was avoiding melodrama) was acceptable  Amell, Barrowman, for the guys and Law for the women were my favorite, the rest were OK, while I never liked snuffly Holland and omnipresent Rickards The 4th season had really great potential and first episodes were very promising   Ghosts  and Constantine were fitting very well, but suddenly the series lost its focus  Characters were not properly introduced, but were coming out of nowhere to make an easy finale for one and only episode etc etc  I'm now at s05e01 and although Arrow seems to return to his origins and the flashbacks are more delicate (missing 5 years, this should be the last season with flashbacks!, hopefully), we are already informed that his days as lone-avenger will be off soon  And I will stop watching because I don't want to see same story again and again  The only reason I might watch is to be informed about its status before cross- overs with other series  It's a pity because the character Arrow is much more interesting than Barry Allen ",6,0.2,6.2,"Positive"
"Arrow","2016-10-10"," This show started off great from season 1, onto season 2, then it began to slow down a bit in season 3 and 4, but it picks up again with action in season 5  There are many story line build ups, and great flashbacks, and it also compliments with the action and fight scenes  One major critic of the show will be how the writers will often attempt to put in too many love sequences in a super hero show, another will be how the story doesn't follow up as well with the Green Arrow comics  If the show sticks to its action first and love story later, it will stay more consistent to what fans would love to see, and this will keep the show alive for a longer number of seasons  The best part of this show is that it provides its viewers with crossover episodes, and team ups with other super hero shows such as the Flash  These crossover episodes provides more action and delivers a comic book genre type of team up for fans or even non comic book fans to enjoy  On a side note, season 2 of this show is by far the best TV show season I have ever watched  Even if you do not have time watching this show, just watch season 2, you won't regret it  ",10,1.1,10,"Positive"

"Arrow","2016-10-02"," As i don't want to write spoilers, i wont give many details  This is my opinion IMHO:The show starts quite good, i had fun for most of the first season  The second season was kinda meh, and had some lame parts, but was OK overall - that mirakuru stretch was just awful - BTW why didn't they invite bane? If you had hopes that the show could get better and not worse, wait for Season 3 where the story writing really goes downhill to a point that it's unwatchable, the chapters are 40 min long, moistly half of it is soap opera like talking and planing  Many things he could have done solo, now he needs the help of 2 or 3 friends just out of convenience (like fighting some random bad guy) Pretty much anyone can use a bow and arrow as its super easy (sarcasm), and also suddenly everybody becomes a fighter, even Thea - this is so lame! And BTW, oliver is a real jerk, he couldn't even give felicity the bottle of wine he promised in the first season (yes, this bothers me)  Overall the directing is bad and amateurish, the show is very lame and stupid, inconsistent, has bad acting like a bunch of wax figures (mostly oliver and laurel) bad outfits, lots of clichés (like the bad guy that talks too much)  Also the show is more like a soap opera and that got on my nervs - i don't'care about so many details of olivers sex life, of who is dating who, of all the flirting  Isn't this a superheroe movie? or is it a superheroe soap opera??I Coulnd't finish season 3, and i will not watch further well, you get the idea right? if you like a smart and interesting show, with good writing and acting, skip this one if you didn't already, then take a look at shows like continuum, chuck, torchwood, daredevil, burn notice (just to say a few)  ",3,-0.1,2.9,"Negative"

"Arrow","2016-09-11"," Dear Oh Dear  I actually (unbelievably ) watched 2 whole seasons of this, because at first I thought it had potential, and the story was OK  I expected it to get better  It is a fantasy about a superhero, so I am happy to suspend disbelief and take it for what it's worth  But enough is enough ! The point it really lost me was not the bad acting, Beverley Hills 90210 type relationship drama or the rest of the criticisms thrown at this show  No, it lost me when EVERYONE ends up being a superhero too  Like his skinny sister who could hardly be strong enough to knock down a six year old takes martial arts lessons and after 6 months or less is an ace superhero herself beating up beefy bad guys  Then his girlfriend Laurel or whatever, ( also so skinny she could barely stand up in a strong wind, let alone get in a fight ), takes lessons at a boxing gym and after 3 months, hey presto, she becomes a masked superhero too, and is wiping the floor with bad guys  Impossible , I hear you say  No way , I hear you say  But no, the writers expect us to swallow that  Like another reviewer said, this could only appeal to 6 year olds, or people with low IQ  ",1,0,1,"Negative"
"Arrow","2016-09-11"," (Warning: Spoilers!!!!!!!!!!!) Hi, my name is Thunderin' Tim and I'll be your reviewer today  So I started watching Arrow and after only 10 episodes felt the need to deliver a review to the millions of awaiting fans (cut to a scene with me behind a signing desk and nobody waiting in line)  There is a fair set-up with lots of potential  There is a big flaw, many things I liked, and some smaller issues and flaws <U+0096>I will discuss it in this order so it's not all good or bad but a nice mix Flaw <U+0096> Slow Down Brotha' Just relax a little  The pace is ridiculous  The first episode: Oliver Queen was in a boat accident and he stranded on an island with more stuff going on than Lost and he comes back after being presumed dead and he returns to the party life but is also a funky version of Robin Hood at night fighting crime whilst juggling a social life that includes his new step daddy, his wayward sis, an ambiguous mom, a best friend who possible slept with his former girlfriend, whose sister was his lover and died in the same boat accident and the girls' father, who's a cop, hates him and<U+0085>  Slow down please! I thought this and then I saw I only was 20 minutes into the show  It's not necessary, it feels rushed, and it doesn't give you time to really like or understand the characters Good stuff <U+0096> Let's Kick Some Butt I like the Monster of the Week style of this early episodes because it reminds me of early Buffy, early X-Files and early Supernatural and that's not a bad thing  I like Ollie and the actor playing him  I dig Dig  Thea is insanely hot  I like the Queen Family dynamic  I like the fighting scenes, makes me want to beat someone up and then run away like a real super hero  I like the flashbacks to the island, and I especially like the crazy Asian dude on it  I like Felicity although I hope she doesn't turn out to be a Garcia from Criminal Minds character, who solves everything the same way every episode Issues 1)Hypocrite: Queen suffers from HHH, and I don't mean the wrestler but Hollywood Hypocrite Heroism <U+0096>the disease that makes a main white male character judge people for doing the same as he (Jack from 24, Jack from Lost etc)  This becomes clear when he is obsessively protective about Thea, who as a teenager goes to clubs, has love interests, and drinks (normal teen stuff)  Queen hates it violently whilst himself having did half of Starling City and being a party boy from the same age  Then in episodes 7 and 8, he meets a girl, does her of course, and upon finding out that she kills bad guys, that are either Triade or Mafia, you know, what he has been doing EVERY EPISODE, he is morally outraged and tries to stop her  With what right? You do the exact same thing 2)She's your sister, you creep!: Ollie and Thea have a weird, almost flirty relationship  He's overly protective, threatens anyone who looks at her whilst being male, she's very touchy, even touching his scars and muscles  But the worst moment is when he catches her making out in a bra  The boy gets a three second warning before being drowned in a bucket of his least favorite soda, but Ollie keeps watching Thea whilst she redresses  Dude! If I walk in on my sister like that I will leave and apologize, or tell the dude to get lost WHILST AVERTING MY GAZE  Not look at her like a pervert 3)Less Than Zero: The BFF character is nice and all, although the 2 of them look like they left the pages of a Bret Easton Ellis novel, but he gets so little background I found him rather useless  Yes he slept with Laurel, and yes he's Ollie's BFF and yes his father cuts him off, but none of it tickled my senses 4)Give me the D: Ollie casually informs him that he knows who killed Dig's brother; informs him how he knows; and informs him he already killed him with all the intensity of debating the baseball results you don't really care about  It's his brother, tell him sooner and better 5)Go back to Ferguson!: the cop character, Laurel's father, is annoying the hell out of me  You're not Riggs from Lethal Weapon nor do you have his goodwill-factor, so take a chill pill 6)Leather Locklear ( High Five!  I shout to an empty apartment): out of all fabrics used to make clothing, the worst one when you expect to do more movement than an Olympic Gymnast, is leather  Why not wear cotton or silk since it gives you much more moving room? DC's and Marvel's obsession with putting hot guys in tight leather outfits brings up some awkward questions Preliminary conclusion: I like Arrow but it will not make Top 10 List  It doesn't intrigue me like X-Files or Californication  I sort of miss the DC feel to it  There are good characters and some nice acting, set design, special effects, and story line, but it also feels rushed and at times, times which call for passionate acting, weirdly passive and muted  The women in the show look fine, as do the guys I would imagine  It looks sharp and high budget  I'm highly curious where it's all going  There are many flaws and slight annoyances, like everyone being either good or bad and Hoodie rarely missing where other highly trained bad guys miss more often than early Stormtroopers  And everyone let's Ollie get away with way to much stuff, but all in all I like it and it didn't put me off and I will keep watching it to see what will happen Will come back later ",7,-0.3,6.7,"Positive"

"Arrow","2016-08-30"," Review of Season One: I'm no huge superhero fan so it's with some trepidation that I sat down to watch ARROW, my first fully-fledged superhero TV series  The good news is that I ended up liking it, although I wouldn't say love  The series is flawed by being overlong and endlessly dragged out with trivial plot points and villain-of-the-week story lines, but it still has an interesting set up and lots of good stuff to counter the bad One of the main problems I have with the show is Stephen Amell as the protagonist  I find the guy a conceited jerk, his arrogance extremely off putting, and that opinion only cemented itself as the episodes went by  On the other hand, David Ramsey gives a strong turn as Arrow's sidekick Diggle, and Paul Blackthorne is very believable as the weary cop on his tail The show has a bit of an odd format whereby half the scenes are told in flashback, exploring Arrow's history on a desert island where he gets involved with some renegade soldiers  These flashbacks lack impact because they've already taken place and are kind of shoehorned into the main, present day narrative  But they do allow for a couple of cool actors, namely Byron Mann and Manu Bennett, to do cool stuff, so I didn't mind too much  ARROW is an easy show to watch because action scenes are inserted into every episode and the action is choreographed as it should be: violent, hard-hitting, and fast-paced; it doesn't disappoint  It's a more than watchable show, which is why I'll be coming back for season two Review of Season Two:Season Two of ARROW is firmly in the category of 'more of the same'  It follows exactly the same template as the successful first season, with the main story told chronologically alongside various flashbacks to Arrow's time on the desert island and his interactions with Slade Wilson (the great Manu Bennett, still the best thing in the show)  The contemporary material has more of a story arc feel to it here, less villain of the week, more building towards something big The action scenes are quite fun, although repetitively staged at times and always seeming to take place in the dark, which gets a bit annoying  I didn't like the last episode, which utilises confusing choreography and time-swapping to poor effect, but otherwise this show is pretty decent  I'm still no fan of the main actor but the supporting cast are fun and you get people like Colin Salmon and Summer Glau turning up just to show you how it's done  ",6,0,6,"Negative"
"Arrow","2016-08-24"," We all know who Bruce Wayne is, Who Clark Kent is, and who Diana Prince is but not many are familiar with who Oliver Queen is  After you watch this show you will definitely remember the name Oliver Queen  I truly love it when comic book companies make a great TV series with a character who previously wasn't as famous and well known as they were prior to the TV show  Arrow is a great show that explores DC's darker side  The Dark Knight also know as Batman has some of his greatest enemies cross paths with The Arrow, which ends up with both men having to fight till death  Some villains discover who The Arrow truly really is under the hood and that puts his friends and family at great risk  Oliver Queen also known as The Green Arrow is one of my new favourite comic characters of all time  For the record before this TV series was even released I had no clue who Oliver Queen or The Green Arrow was  I owe the creator and cast of this show a big high five and hug for doing such a great job in bringing a not so familiar name to the small screen  Some of you may say  but hey I know Oliver Queen/The Green Arrow, I have seen him in a animated series as a kid growing up  Well the unfortunate part is that not many people have seen the animated series where Batman and The Green Arrow fight side by side to stop crime in their cities  This show does not lack in action, comedy or deep emotional moments  It has everything it needs to be one of the best DC TV series today  From season 1 to now you truly have the privilege to see Oliver Queens mindset and views on life drastically change after each new experience he encounters  Whether The Green Arrow dodges death or saves his city once again Oliver Queens life will never truly be normal  Everyone he loves and truly cares for will always be at risk  Arrow starts off as a realistic crime TV series but then later on develops into a true comic book masterpiece  Comic book TV shows have always been around even when some of us didn't even exist  Arrow truly put DC Comics on the map with this great show  The Flash and Legends of Tomorrow wouldn't even exist if it wasn't for The Green Arrow  It truly started something great for DC in the TV industry  Comic book fan or not, Arrow is for an audience all over the world  Before this show I had no clue who The Arrow was and why they would make a show about a comic book character who not many are familiar with  It makes all sense to me now    Introducing new characters from comics we no longer have so much access to is a great way to expand the DC universe and get new fans to adore a character who has been hidden or over shadowed by other superheroes  In my honest opinion I strongly suggest viewers to give this show a chance  You wont regret it  Some comic book fans are probably already sold way before reading a review or seeing a trailer online which is a good thing as this show definitely does not disappoint   But to those who have no knowledge of the DC comic book world please don't get discouraged as this show is literally for anyone  Comic book geek or not this show truly makes you want to see more and more after each episode  Arrow started it all when it comes to DC's TV series success and believe me it will continue for many more years to come  I truly hope people watch this show  They are in store for an amazing experience :) ",10,0.7,10,"Positive"

When each character would enter the show, they'd bring a new and dynamic approach? How every villain would differ from the other? If you don't remember that, then you probably started watching after s2  And for that, I sincerely apologize Now let's get down to business  Arrow used to be great  Hell, Arrow used to be a lot of good things  Now there isn't a positive thing to say  The writing is below par, the story lines, the plots, character and/or development are all terrible  Felicity isn't the problem, it's the writers  Guggenheim & co  They took a very good character, and milked the absolute crap out of her  Felicity Smoak should of NEVER been a main character  She was at her best when she was only supporting  Characters like Felicity should never be main characters on Superhero shows  Soap Operas & drama's? Hell yes, for sure  A character that brings nothing more than romance, and Soap Opera-type drama should never of even touched Arrow  Now the overall writing  It's bland  It's cliché  It's BORING  We are COMIC BOOK FANS  We don't come here to cry over relationships, or intend to see 40 minutes of pure drama  We come to watch Green Arrow beat up bad guys, save his city & just be downright awesome  (Keep in mind, this review is for the present Arrow, s3 & 4  S1& 2 is a whole different ball game ) And lastly, the acting  Let's talk about the god damn acting  Back in the golden age of Arrow, we experienced good acting  We were drawn into the characters, the actors made us genuinely care about them  Amell was strange, dark & mysterious  He was destroyed inside  Bennett was brutal, he was menacing  He never let up  We wanted to hate him, but Manu's dynamic ability to show us so many sides & layers to Wade Wilson was phenomenal  Now we get sub par level acting  No dynamic abilities  No layers  No thought provoking performances, or performances that make us go  OH MY GOD   It's the type of acting you expect from a crappy Romcom  And ironically enough, it's the sort of acting that you expect from a Soap Opera  Overall Arrow really doesn't deserve the popularity it's still getting  It's a clear & utter cash cow of a project  Passion & dedication completely went out of the window when Kreisberg & Berlanti left and gave Guggenheim control  Nobody is involved with Arrow that actually cares about anymore  Writers & actors alike  Now all it is, is a shell of its former self  A show completely destroyed & ripped to pieces by itself  1/10 DO NOT WATCH S3, S4  I highly recommend watching S1 & 2  Those seasons were amazing  Also, I don't recommend tuning in for the upcoming seasons  I have no faith in Arrow anymore  Tune into other shows  I highly suggest Netflix's Daredevil  Daredevil is the sort of show that Arrow would of been if Guggenheim was nerve given complete control  Hell, Daredevil is even a step up from the early Arrow seasons  ",1,0,1,"Negative"
"Arrow","2016-08-11"," Arrow is a show that has a lot of meaning to it that included in each episode  You can take many things from watching this series but more than that you are able to see over the period of this series the sacrifices that Oliver Queen must make in order for the greater good  In order for him to save the city he has to be more than a man but by doing that he has to become less human  The meanings from this series can be taken out and applied to real life situations  That in order to achieve a certain goal you will need to make certain sacrifices  During the duration of this series you are able to see how Oliver Queen has developed as a person and as a hero and sometimes lines are crossed for the greater good  By doing so however you are able to see the differences of how Oliver Queen handles such setbacks  The realistic part of this show is that if you choose the life of a crime fighter people will always get hurt and may even die and that even though you wear a mask your loved ones are still in danger  ",8,0,8,"Positive"

You can literally predict when she's gonna be self-obsessed because she makes almost all topics about her  I want you to play a game for me, well two games  1  Drink every time she manages to swing a subject so she becomes sub-topic, and 2  Take a lick of your rum and raisin ice-cream every time she says  me  or  I  and I promise you, you'll be wasted after 10 minutes  I only mentioned rum and raisin ice cream because of the low alcohol content, so the statement should be supported by its own legs  Anyway, Arrow is amazing, and I don't mean to sound harsh, or callous, but I'm glad the character Laurel is dead because I hate the sincerely self-obsessed/indulged/righteous, the ones who truly get upset and screechy because the person in hand wasn't thinking about them for once  I realise this was more of a rant than a review, but I've speed watched seasons 3&4, and it just got to me  ",9,0,9,"Positive"

"Arrow","2016-06-20"," I started watching this show in a rather a circuitous way  I was watching Flash, which I really enjoyed and in one of the Flash episodes, I came across some Arrow characters  My 14 year old son suggested that I watch Arrow first  I just finished all 3 seasons (69 episodes) on Netflix and compelled to write this review The first season was sort of fun and crisp moving  Having said that, what started as a  Super hero  show turned out to a day time soap Opera of a dysfunctional family with debauchery, stupidity, ambiguity & just plain O'l dumbness all around  So, why did I watch all the episodes? Simple, the female characters in this show are smoking hot!!  Willa Holland as Thea queen, Katie Cassidy as Laurel Lance, Emily Bett Rickards as Felicity Smoak to name a few Now, let's talk about some of the characters in the show  I promise that there are NO SPOILERS  1) Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell): The main character (i e  Arrow)  Good looking and very handsome, no doubt  However, he is little slow witted  Starting season 2, he does not want to use lethal force and that repeatedly comes back to bite him in the a**  I am not a violent person, however in some situations as a supposed savior of the city, you have to use lethal force2) Laurel Lance (Katie Cassidy): Oliver's girlfriend and a wannabe vigilante  How can anybody be so dumb and be a vigilante without any training  She gets her beautiful ass kicked repeatedly  She is really hot and her curves are kicking 3) Thea Queen (Willa Holland): Oliver's spoiled little sister and is a real babe  Her mid riff is absolutely gorgeous  I don't want to talk about her more and give away some surprises 4) Felicity Smoak: Blond and brainy (that is not an oxymoron)  I just adore this character  She is funny, chirpy and touches your heart with her double entendre sentences  ",5,0.8,5.8,"Negative"
"Arrow","2016-06-20"," The struggle for redemption, forgiveness and becoming a better person  This is what this show is all about  Throughout every season, Oliver's desire to keep his city out of danger is tested but as always, he manages to overcome anything thrown his way  This take on DC's 'Green Arrow' keeps you hooked throughout every season and never leaves a moment of action-packed ass- kicking  There are, however, some episodes that do let you down but, 'Arrow' does not disappoint and keeps you at the edge of your seat every time Playboy Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell), decides to go on a trip with his father  But after an accident, he gets stranded on a mysterious island called Li-An-Yu  After five years, he returns to Starling City as a reformed man  But Oliver is back with an agenda - to get rid of all evil poisoning his city    with the help of a bow and arrow  What ensues is Oliver's on-going battle with his own inner-demons whilst punishing those who is a threat  With the help of his friends, John Diggle (David Ramsey), Felicity Smoak (Emily Bett Rickards) and Laurel Lance (Katie Cassidy), Oliver learns to manage his break down his own walls and work as the vigilante known as 'The Green Arrow' Amell's portrayal as the newly reformed Oliver Queen intrigues you instantly and makes you wonder about his story and his motivation  His right-hand man John Diggle quickly becomes a brother-figure to him which Oliver takes time getting used to  Ramsey's performance of the ex- military is great and acting as 'the voice of reason', provides the viewers an insight into the rational side of a catastrophe  Emily Bett Rickards as Felicity Smoak is just    the perfect casting  Her as the bubbly I T girl is amazing and her ramblings distracts you from the action - only if it's for a few moments  Katie Cassidy as Laurel is great too and as Oliver's ex, definitely is an example of how an ex should be    supportive and a great friend The first season, as are all first seasons in every show, is the introductory one where you get to know the characters and what their agendas are  So you don't get to see much  But, the subsequent seasons takes you down a darker route, where Oliver's main goal is one thing and one thing only - making sure Starling City is a save place to live  The flashbacks does take you away from the primary story, which can be frustrating, but manages to give an insight into what happens to Oliver when he is stranded on Li-An-Yu  Overall, I think you can give this show a chance  The dark tones are refreshing and there are some comedic moments which provides relief, so you don't feel depressed after watching an episode  ",7,0.4,7.4,"Positive"

"Arrow","2016-05-11"," Creating live-action comicbook adaptations comes with a risk  For starters, you begin the game with the racial bonus of a big, rabid fanbase  Of course, the mass and the degree of rabidness here are direct functions of popularity, and if you decide to work with a rather obscure title, the bonus reduces accordingly  On the other hand, this also sort of imposes a certain responsibility on the creators, as they are compelled to pander to the existing fanbase by way of peppering the flick with lots of fanservice, avoiding plot twists which would send the fans into a berserker rage, and so on  Choosing not to limit yourself with the guidelines set by the original work is akin to choosing not to play your half-orc as a barbarian  Feasible, but wasteful  The bigger the fanbase, the bigger the waste  So, there you have it, a double-edged sword Arrow is a reimagination of the popular DC franchise, the Green Arrow  A reinvention of its rather famous characters and recreation of major story lines  And a whole other slew of new-age terms which mean,  Okay, we can still milk the heck out of this cow; all we gotta do is start with a story, tack names from the comics on our characters, and make stuff up as we go, calling this a Green Arrow adaptation all the way  May sound harsh, but the truth is, the producers decided to start out with a half-orc mage, and the characters and setting bear scant resemblance with the original comic, even after four seasons and all those comments over how they will grow closer to their classic counterparts as the series goes on  Apparently the producers thought they could do what Nolan did with Batman and tried to make a show based on classic superhero fantasy but without the fantasy  That obviously did not do, however; avoiding spoilers here, the series began including more and more surreal elements after the first season, so maybe that is what them creators meant by bringing the show closer to its roots  But this Oliver Queen still has nothing to do with the playful, charming Ollie the fans know and love  Due to all the brooding and grit, people compared him to Batman rather than Green Arrow  I call bogus  He straight-up started out as the Punisher  He is just barely growing out of it So why 8 out of 10? Because it is jolly good fun  And suspense  The writing is not Shakespearean, but all these twists and turns and cliffhangers always keep you on your toes and make for an all-around entertaining experience  The flashbacks allow for organic character development, actually displaying why who is doing what at the present, making sense of decisions by showing where people come from, or even sometimes characters coming to understand the lesson the flashback scenes taught them back then  Coincidences may appear to come out of nowhere at times, though, but they are excusable for the most part, owing to the fact that every comicbook story needs the odd deus ex machina here and there  Dramatic conversations, however   well, the dialogue comes across intolerably cheesy and forced more often than not, prompting you to yell,  Oh, for the love of     But then they go back to the action, and the action is pretty good  The production quality is on par with a typical action movie, and yes, I am talking theatrical release here Faithfulness to the source material be damned; these folks are telling their own story and they are doing a darn good job about it  So if you are just interested in good old popcorn entertainment, promise yourself not to cry  What have they done to my Ollie?

"Arrow","2016-05-10"," Season 3 was mediocre, but season 4 has a huge drop in quality (shoutout to Marc  Franchise Slaughterer  Guggenheim)  If you are a fan of the series, do yourself a favor and stop watching  The Flash is really hitting it's stride if you're desperate for CW superhero shows  This season of Arrow is just a crudely stitched together collection of tumblr fanfics  The characters have lost any real personality, and just serve to move the plot forward (this season is plagued by writers using half- baked concepts to push the  plot  forward by brute force)  They frequently make decisions that defy any form of logic as well as any character traits of note  Any development that the characters have made in the past seasons has just disappeared, seemingly because they oppose Guggenheim's Mary Sue couple  Also it would be a misconception to think that the villain is the basis of any overarching plot  He's just a side note to said couple  Really this season seems to lack any direction whatsoever  It's like the writers are giving up on trying to provide any cohesive story  And to make it worse, while they could look back to some of the source material for some good ideas, they spit in its face in favor of their own rambling mess As a side-note, I feel that the length of this show has been a huge detractor from the start  Even in it's glory days, the seasons probably could have been trimmed in half or lower and tell the same story  A lot of the time on this show is wasted on silly stuff, and could it could be a huge improvement to trim down the story to something more concise and save more for the effects budget  But honestly, is nobody in the studio checking up on them? Was this really looked at and approved by real people in the entertainment business? It boggles my mind that this could make it to air on such a well known show  The CW's superhero shows have always been aimed at a more  teeny  audience, but at the levels that Guggenheim has taken it to, it seems like he would be better off writing those fanfics and letting someone with moderate respect for the story's integrity take over  I love the actors in this and wish them the best, but the only hope I can see for this show is to retcon this season and get a fresh team of writers because this may be the biggest train wreck I have ever witnessed make the air  ",2,0,2,"Negative"

"Arrow","2016-04-26"," I'm writing a 'spoiler free' review, so don't worry guys!!!Season 1 :Rating - 10/10S1 was full of action-packed stuff and was fun  It has lots of plot twists and the actors have done a good job in depicting their respective characters with a convincing plot  In short , Season 1 of Arrow is worth watching  Season 2 :Rating - 10/10S2 carries the same action packed sequences with a more interesting plot and it thrills the viewers  Again, the ending was convincing and I personally feel season 2 had the best villain  Again, its worth a watch Season 3 :Rating - 8 5/10After expecting a lot from the hit series, I was disappointed after watching the 3rd season  The fight sequences became sloppy and boring  Even though, the main plot is as thrilling as ever, You can basically feel they are dragging it to finish it in the end  Last 3 episodes were fun so I have nothing to say about that  But in some episodes, I felt that the action packed series changed into a soap opera, considering the lot of crying, a character blaming him/herself for many things and some other character convincing him/her that its not their fault  It gets sloppy      I was so disappointed after watching this season  But I couldn't stop it because I always believed that the 4th season could be better like the other seasons  Season 4Rating - 7 5/10After the disappointment from the 3rd season, I expected some new action from the fourth season  BUT, The plot is boring as hell, I wonder whether they follow the actual comic story  Every episode is boring, with too many fillers  Fight sequences - rubbish  OK , not totally rubbish, but it's bad     I think 19 episodes released till now    There was hardly any plot in this season  Heard they are making a Season 5 for this show    Again, I hope they make it better this time    I don't believe in third chances I recommend DC fans to watch this show  For casual viewers who want some entertaining plot, you'll do fine with the first two seasons and for people who watch 'the flash' or 'legends of tomorrow' or both, it'll be a good watch because those three are inter-connected with the characters and the plot  ",6,0.3,6.3,"Positive"
"Arrow","2016-04-19"," First, I want to start off this review by saying that I was a loyal DC Comics fan when I was younger so I tend to show favoritism to shows that stay true to the comics  The first 2 seasons of this show were great  Of course there were some filler episodes as is the case with shows that run a full length of 23 episodes in a season  One of the reasons why the miniseries format on Cable and streaming services are of higher quality- less episodes so the writers can be more creative and don't have to spend 23 episodes to build to a conclusion at the end of the season  But even with all those challenges, Arrow was able to be a GREAT show with all those episodes for the first 2 seasons  At the beginning of season 3, the writers lost themselves  It seems as if their creativity ran out and plot lines and episode villains were recycled  The desperation of these writers to gain back the respect of their audience has lead to departure of lead characters which surely had tarnished this show's quality forever  This show is currently on season 4 and I truly believe there is no going back  I give this show a 6 because the first 2 seasons deserved a 9 out of 10 because of the quality- the last 2 seasons deserved a 4  You can make the argument that Arrow was the show that paved the way for shows like Daredevil, The Flash, and Jessica Jones because of the quality in the first 2 seasons  That is no longer the case  What a shame    ",6,0.2,6.2,"Positive"

"Arrow","2016-04-07"," I really loved this show in season 1 and 2  The show started out as a good show in season 1, and got a lot better in season 2 with Deathstroke  Season 2 even had Deadshot and the Suicide Squad, which I loved  There were a lot of Easter eggs for comic book fans, and the show was good for both casual fans and comic book fans  Then came season 3, and things went downhill  It was not all bad  They introduced Ray Palmer (The Atom), and that was cool  But they butchered his character, making him seem like and Iron Man knockoff, giving him a super suit that can fly, and can shoot blasts of whatever they're calling it  What they should have done was give him a suit that ONLY allows him to shrink and be basically Ant-Man (comic book fans know that Ant-Man is an Atom ripoff)  But instead, they made him Iron Man who can also shrink  That's number one  Number two is the League of Assassins  While I love Nyssa, using the League takes the show from a borderline Batman ripoff to full on Batman  And then there is  Olicity   Putting Oliver and Felicity together is just fan service to the casual fans who wrote fan fics for  Olicity   And then in Season 4  The big bad that may make me stop watching the show  Killing Laurel  They butchered her character by making her unlikable in season 1, and making her sister the Black Canary instead of her, is an insult to the comics  They wouldn't even give her her actual powers, instead making it into a weak choker necklace that she rarely uses  Then they kill her  Just by stabbing her with an arrow  Killing her off means they should change the name and remove the DC brand, because this is no longer a Green Arrow show  Bottom line: Watch season 1 and 2, maybe parts of season three, since it wasn't all bad  But don't watch season 4  No matter who you are  It's bad writing, and a disservice to the comics  ",6,0.3,6.3,"Positive"

"Arrow","2016-04-03"," Arrow is a very good show initially  Sure the acting is not always great, and a few of the characters are annoying, but until about mid 2nd-season this is very entertaining and has great character development  But thereafter    oh my    If you want a good show, stop watching after the 2nd season  If you, on the other hand, want to see pretty much every character on the show running around with a bow and fighting bad guys after 2 weeks of training without getting shot every 2sec, then you might like the rest as well  In this show you, as a woman, can go to the gym and practice boxing for a few weeks and then you are ready to fight grown men by the dozen  And this is not the only premise which is ridiculous to say the least  The show still produce one or two episodes which are good, also after season two, but in general the show becomes so boring and so predictable and get so many plot-holes it is hard to see its the same show  Only a few guest appearances by The Flash and a few scenes here and there keep the spirit up  Also on this show they cannot die  Someone get a sword through their chest? Well throw them into this puddle of water and whamowhamo they are beating up bad guys again  Someone explodes? No worries! Its all fine  Stabbed to death in prison? Pfff, thats nothing, just get up and shake it off    In the beginning of the show it was exciting and although you sort of know the heroes will pull through, it is never a certain, they even lose once in a while  But keep watching and you suddenly know that even a dull pointless character that really should have died in prison, actually survives and comes back later I still have some hope for Arrow  It can still turn things around, but if not I really hope the next season is the last because the show has been dying slowly for a couple of years now  Personally I love the basic gang from season 1 plus the Thea Queen character, the rest should just die in some horrible attack which would rejuvenate the show, bring some excitement back and give us a feel of dread again  Oh, and Oliver should stop dreaming and flashing back to that stupid island by now  Every single episode, even as the show goes on, he flashes back to his Robinson Crusoe days  Stop it please!

"Arrow","2016-01-08"," Arrow is successfully disappointing in every aspect that I could think of: (big spoiler alert!!! )1 Directing- The scenes are poorly directed  Lets start from the poor performance of the characters which I believe could have done better with another director  For example Oliver (the Arrow) is believed to be dead for 5 years, when he comes back home from the dead he get a soft hug from his sister (Really??? a hug ??? you could think he went on a bushiness trip and came back), don't get me wrong I'm not looking for much emotions in this series but this is a poor understanding of the situation  Other then the performance the scenes are just not professionally filmed! another strong example is at one of the scenes Oliver is talking with his mother not arguing of fighting but using cold sentences to each other) and all of a sudden his sister ,which observed them from far distance, claim that they had a fight (OK maybe she can read their lips)  there are so many scenes that I can give you but you got the point and I should continue to the next thing  Second thing which keeps going all the time is that the Arrow is using arrows and his enemies using guns,automatic weapons and they keep missing the target As far as I can tell the arrow doesn't have a super dodge ability, and it seemed too lame that police officers, S W A T teams and special forces soldier all miss the Arrow and even the camera angle doesn't let you thing that there is a far distance between them (oh God this is insulting)  Third thing is that many time the Arrow is hunting some evil guy and they seem to miraculously disappear right in front of him!! (OK maybe he is not that a sharp hero) 2 Plot development- OK this even worse the the poor directing  for a whole season Oliver is murdering people who allegedly corrupted the city He is the judge and the executioner (Ok this will change as the series goes)  but what really bothers me is that most of the characters around the Arrow doesn't seem to worry about the killing spree  Only 2 characters does, and only at a very late part of the series  Another thing is that there are 3-4 enemies that keep come back at the first and second season  I love when a character is suddenly comes back to the series but this is happening too many time!! with the same characters !! come on the DC universe has plenty of villains, use them! Another is that the Arrow identity isn't kept as secret as you expect, at some point everyone knows who is the Arrow except new villains  One last thing that shows again how the plot is poorly developed is that the characters had done some terrible things one to another (cheating, lying, kidnapping,drugging, murdering ) but they somehow in an unreasonable way forgive each other or even worse - help each other (!?!?)  I could keep on criticizing this series and keep on with the spoilers (the big one is at middle of season 3 which I decided not to mention here) but if you read this far you probably make up your mind already so Ill save you from more spoilers/criticizing  2 good things I have to say about the Arrow (the reason why I rate it 3/10 and not 1/10) 1 The connection to the DC comic world by joining interesting character to the series (especially joining forces with another TV series  A step I think had never been seen before on the screen)  but this happened too late I suppose to save this poor series  you probably ask yourself why I keep watching this series, only to understand another good, amazing, thrilling and Flashing series  2  Villains that are though enough to beat down the arrow - this is comes only at the middle of season 2 and season 3 but it surely add a lot to the emptiness of this series   and of course the Arrow ridiculously defeat them somehow thanks to the director In a sentence - this series could have been much greater, but it managed to be a disaster (i e the Arrow character at Smallville was way much better)  this is a real insult to your intelligence  think twice before staring to watch this big disappointment  ",3,-0.8,2.2,"Negative"
"Arrow","2016-01-07"," A lot of the reviews for the show say that Arrow isn't any good because it's repetitive, unoriginal, poorly-scripted, etc , and I completely disagree  THIS SHOW IS ABOUT HOW OLIVER QUEEN BECOMES THE GREEN ARROW  It's meant to be an origins story, so I agree when people say the characters (especially Oliver) make the same mistakes more than once, but it's supposed to be that way  This show is meant to portray how Oliver Queen went from being consumed by darkness (as Arrow) to being a symbol of hope for Star City (as Green Arrow)  Oliver has a really messed up background, and this story tries to explain how he overcame his definite trust issues and overbearing protectiveness to BECOME A HERO  I never read the comics or anything like that, but my main reason for loving this show is because of the character evolution  It's crazy to watch the current season and go back to watch the first episodes of season 1 because the show is so incredibly different now  Oliver has gone from being a murderer to becoming a hero, and that means the tone of the show has changed entirely  Something else you have to remember when watching this show is that it's television  Every show (especially the ones on the cw) needs drama to survive  You have to keep the show interesting, and the characters have to be doing something new every season, or it'll get stale  So far, the writers have done a pretty good job at this  They do recycle old material ever now and then, but they've done an okay job so far  I will admit that the first couple seasons had a lot of filler episodes, but so far in season 4, there haven't been many (if any at all) that didn't directly go back to main big bad of the season  There have been a couple that were meant to set up the new show Legends of Tomorrow that I could have lived without though I will agree with other viewers when they say the show can be inconsistent because there are a couple of things that tend to get annoying  Like Laurel Lance  The character doesn't serve any purpose that someone else can't fill, and I'm still trying to figure out how she got so good at fighting within like 5 episodes  And is she even a lawyer anymore?

"Arrow","2015-11-30"," I really do not understand how this show has an 8 1 average  Sometimes it is so difficult to fathom how the writers came up with such a clichéd TV series  Now don't get me wrong, I am all about clichés and cheesy dialogues but this show has taken all of those aspects to a whole new level with an extra strong added ingredient of  stupid  For example, Sara Lance comes back to Starling City, and just because she wears a tiny eye mask, her own sister cannot tell it's her? And what's with the cheesy  Mirakuru ? It would have sounded much less cheesier if they had called it  The miracle drug  or something like that Another example, is when Thea Queen get's kidnapped by Slade  If you get  KIDNAPPED , you'd be fearing for your life  I mean did Thea know that Slade was not going to kill her when she was first abducted? She would have been quaking in her boots and traumatized, to say the LEAST  Yet when she is let go, the only thing she can dwell on is the fact that Oliver didn't tell her the truth about her father? Really? Wouldn't she just be happy that she  STILL HAS HER OWN LIFE ?Things like this keep bothering the hell out of me, and the ONLY reason I watch this show (albeit while biting down on my tongue), is because I want to know how the story fits with The Flash, and all the good TV shows have been watched already If you don't care about whether a TV show makes sense, or care about storyline, or decent action, then go ahead and watch it, but for me    I'm awestruck at how stupid a show they can make Some GOOD TV shows I can recommend:- Person of Interest- Da Vinci's Demons- The Blacklist- The Flash ",2,0.1,2.1,"Negative"

"Arrow","2015-11-05"," I bought the first 2 seasons of Arrow before watching it, and boy am I glad that I started before I bought anymore  I never read the comic books, so I was going into this show with no real idea of who the Green Arrow was  And I must say it didn't leave a good impression of him on me  The plot isn't well developed  Each episode has a conflict introduction at the beginning and a resolution at the end  It really takes away from the feel of it as a show, with most conflicts not carrying over into the next few episodes  If your going to hold a big angry grudge then hold it for longer than 45 minutes, especially considering the characters reactions are so overdone when they begin a grudge and when they end it  The general plot is pretty generic for a superhero show, which is fine, but I feel like it could have been so much deeper still The characters themselves aren't great  The actors really aren't anything special, which doesn't help in selling the characters  They have a handful of emotional breakdowns in every episode, and it gets stale really, really fast  It just becomes recycled scenes, and it feels unoriginal and repetitive  And overall the characters can be pretty dumb and oftentimes feel this way thanks to these emotional breakdowns  You could say that they're just emotional people, but considering the fact that EVERYONE is like this, it makes the cast feel much less diverse and interesting  Not only that, but they are oftentimes just dumb people  Not just a few characters, the majority of them make lots of really dumb decisions all the time where the safer and easier resolution is blatantly obvious   Look I understand that this is a superhero show but you don't have to take the most risky path Oliver because chances are you'll get shot again  The pilot and first episode of season 2 were some of the worst episodes I've ever seen in any TV show  If I had watched the pilot on TV and hadn't bought the first two seasons I definitely would not have continued  I did like that the show focuses more on the characters than fighting bad guys  Unfortunately, the characters weren't done that well to begin with, so the show was lacking in this case  The last 4-5 episodes of both seasons were often much better than the rest of the season, which provided enough reason to continue with the series after season 1 (mostly with the hopes that it'd get better)  I don't plan on going past season 2, but it was nice to see that the show made it's last stand of the season a good one  The best part of the show in my opinion were the flashbacks  Often the best episodes were ones where flashbacks were frequent and clips from them were longer than 10 seconds  Overall Arrow just wasn't that great  The excess of emotional breakdowns got annoying and took away from the characters, the structure of each episode, and the shallow plot combined made it difficult to get through at times  I found that the show could very inconsistent at times, with one thing being a problem at one point but then that problem disappearing because it was easier film-wise to just not address it ever again  However, it makes up in some way due to the flashbacks and improvements at the end of each season  Unfortunately, the ending wasn't enough to keep me going for another season of forced drama and poor story-telling  Sure, it had it's good points, but in the end the show just wasn't anything special  ",6,0,6,"Negative"

"Arrow","2015-09-18"," *WARNING CONTAINS HEAVY SPOILERS* As of today I've only watched the first two seasons, but I wanted to review this show already, just because it's so great  This is a show about what would really happen if someone put on a costume and started fighting crime  And two seasons later we're all loving it  Let's start with the pros  The cast is all really good  Willa Holland as Thea Queen is especially good, as is Manu Bennet as Slade Wilson, aka Deathstroke  That's not to discredit the others, they're all good as well, I just can't list each one individually because a) I don't know their names and b) if I did, we'd be here all day  Something else I like about the show is how much it emulates the comics  We have standard tropes of the comic books as well as subtle references, and the occasional poke at the source material  Aside from Flash, no superhero show has ever captured the comics this well, and this show takes everything good about comics, and everything good about regular drama/crime shows, and merges it together to make what just might be my favorite show  I also like that it doesn't degenerate into cartoony silliness, and keeps the entire thing grounded in reality, and takes the whole thing seriously  That being said though, I loved that they later introduced some actual super-powers, Slade, Roy, etc  I think it would've been interesting if Roy had kept his powers, and he was forced to control them, I think that would've been very interesting  But here's something strange, people I know did not like the inclusion of super-powers, so    am I alone on this, or what? Let's talk about the finales some, and a couple other episodes that stand out  I liked the ending of season 1 because you had a really great wrap up to everything, a final duel with the villain that had a great climax, and a really tragic moment when Tommy dies and the Glades are destroyed  It's interesting seeing the bad guys kind of winning  The finale to season 2 on the other hand was more or less a mixed bag for me  Let me put it this way: when it was the personal fight between Oliver and Slade, that was good  When it was armies of super-soldiers just getting wiped out by the League of assassins, I was actually kind of bored  They diminished the threat of the soldiers to the point where you didn't feel any danger  The other episode I wanted to talk about was City of Blood, which follows Moira Queen's death, in this episode, Oliver is going to turn himself in to Slade to save the rest of his loved ones  They handled that really well, with how you don't see Oliver for almost half the episode, and his resignation to his defeat was really touching  Now on one final note, let's talk villains  First off, Huntress is a great villain (villainess?) Because it wasn't just the clichéd thing where Oliver realizes she's bad and just no longer cares about her  No, you can tell he still cares, and as Diggle points out, he would've killed her if she was anyone else  Now let's talk Merlyn and Slade  Merlyn was great because he was the behind the scenes manipulator combined with the evil reflection of the hero, and the actor just played him with the right level of smugness, that you really love to hate him  Slade was the type of villain who's super powerful and is out to tear Oliver's life apart because of the loss of the woman he loved  As I said earlier, he was played really well, and was very menacing  Between the two main villains, I would have to give Death-stroke the edge, because he was developed more, and just had more of an overall presence  So there you go, that's my take on Arrow, here's hoping the third season is just as good  ( by the way, I'll update this once I've finished watching season 3) ",9,0.7,9.7,"Positive"

S2 will be interesting, I expect/ hope it will get better  As they show they know how to do it, and be that the case, if you're smart you learn from your lapses  So, now on to the next season! Sorry   hard as I tried   could not get through more than several episodes of season two  What this show really fails to do is come up with some bad guys that you really love to hate !!

"Arrow","2015-08-17"," NOTE: SPOILERS AHEADWhen I first saw the trailer for this show, having been a big Justice League fan as a kid, I immediately (and erroneously) started looking forward to watching this show  Oliver Queen to me was always like an alternative to Batman with his sort of solo act, martial arts type persona, along with added humor  However, while this rendition of Oliver Queen has both the fitness and martial arts skills down, his portrayal of the character seems almost confused at times, as he seems to try too hard to be faking the playboy type guy that he once was, while also being a serious tough guy at other times  These almost bipolar type actions detract from the character, as one would only expect Oliver Queen to be able to naturally be able to play both roles rather than one or the other  Had this series been a little more realistic, then Oliver Queen would have been effectively giving himself away as a fake to anybody who spends more than 10 minutes around him  This however, I could forgive or perhaps live with until the character becomes more refined, however there is an even bigger problem that I have with this series    THE WRITING! When I watch this show, there are often cringe worthy one liners (often times followed by the characters walking away from the person they just supposedly  zinged ), and awkward pauses all along the way, which I guess the writers/producers may have thought evoked more emotion, but it is terribly overused and makes the series feel more like a Soap Opera than an action series  I mean seriously, most true to heart superhero action fans are not looking for a soap opera styled show with excessive drama, and the plot is already thick enough on its own that a dramatic pause after every big detail really is not necessary  Oliver Queen I really think if the writers/producer took a similar style to the now critically proclaimed Daredevil Netflix Original series, DC comic's Arrow really could be a true competitor There are a few more issues that I could go on about, like the fact that every person who shoots an automatic weapons seems less capable of shooting something than a Stormtrooper from Star Wars  Or that it is not explained until at least very late into the 1st season (as that is as far as I got before having to call it quits) how Oliver Queen became a computer genius after being away for 5 years on a deserted island even though he is somehow able to program a computer virus to steal 40 million dollars in the first episode  Or the fact that Queen brought all sorts of top of the line bulky tech and workout equipment down to an abandoned warehouse when all he seems to drive in the first season is a motorcycle without all the homeless people outside the warehouse noticing him bringing the equipment in      I could go on, but it would be pointless  This series had some serious potential, and maybe it does get better after the first season  But I honestly couldn't bring myself to watch more of the Soap Opera style nonsense that this series seems to have been successful by  If you are really looking for a great, much better written superhero series at the moment, I strongly recommend Netflix's Daredevil  This series, Arrow, is not deserving of the 8 1 it now has on IMDb, as that rating was quite misleading to me  I seriously hope this series lives on, but through the eyes of different writers, because I really do like the story line and actors  Actors: 7/10Action: 6 5/10 (the guys missing Arrow in some sequences with fully auto weapons was cringe worthy)Plot: 7/10 (starting from episode 1, the plot has more holes at first than Swiss Cheese, but at least some get filled by 3/4 of the way through Season 1)Writing: 4/10Overall: 6/10 ",6,0,6,"Negative"
"Arrow","2015-08-03"," Following the theme of Nolan's gritty Dark Knight, we are given the TV show about Arrow, a billionaire playboy turned vigilante  You'd think that that's where the similarities would end, but it doesn't  Watching this TV show, I felt like I was watching a lazy rip off of the Dark Knight trilogy, except this time there is far too much soap operas, not enough moral dilemmas, and a lot or racy scenes to rope in newcomers This show's iteration of Oliver Queen is broody, a master martial artist, and tactical genius - sound familiar? That's right, Queen here is not a gruff guy with a sense of humour, he's just broody  In fact, a major plot point in season 2 practically screams Batman But Oliver Queen's live screen portrayal is not that bad  At one point or another, I had just wished they had killed off one of the main characters because it was just that unbearable  A lot of them felt very one dimensional, only gaining depth in the later half of season 2 - which is very late to flesh out characters  This is probably due to the cringe-worthy dialogue that even the best actors would have trouble making the audience believe the emotional weight behind it Special effects and scale of the actions scenes are very lacking in size and scope as well as authenticity  The fighting looks extremely choreographed with long panning shots generally seen in Asian martial arts films, but the thing is, the actors in Arrow don't have a martial arts background which makes the long panning shots feel caricatured All in all, the acting could be better if the directing was better  Dialogue needs a huge overhaul, and there is a lot of potential wasted when it comes to the story  So many times, the narrative could've been more powerful if the writers were willing to take a more daring risk instead of the clichéd deus ex wrap up  ",5,0.1,5.1,"Negative"

"Arrow","2015-07-14"," Okay, first of all, I never thought I would post a review on IMDb and least of all about the 'Arrow' series  This is basically why: I started watching 'Arrow' mainly because all my other favorite series had either finished or in between seasons (just for comparison, some of them are 'Breaking Bad', 'Game of Thrones', 'True Detective', 'Hannibal', 'The Walking Dead', 'Mad Men' etc ) I also enjoy superhero flicks and series, I gave 'The Flash' a go and I actually liked it, especially towards the end of season one  That's where I first got to know of the Arrow character and that the Flash and Arrow series are intertwined, so I decided to give 'Arrow' a chance  The pilot was promising, if a little bit clichéd and predictable, but as we all know, a pilot is maybe the most difficult episode for a series, since it has to intrigue the viewer, introduce main characters and plot points and a plethora of other elements  The story of Oliver Queen also has an almost comical resemblance to that of Bruce Wayne's, but that's all I can say before venturing in spoiler territory  So, my opinion on the series in a nutshell - the first few episodes I didn't like so much, but still stuck to watching 'Arrow', mainly because I had a good feeling about the plot  Acting, dialogue, action sequences were all sub-par, if not awful  This is what went on throughout the first season  However, I was not dissuaded by the negative reviews in IMDb or my own high standards, and I'm thankful for it  Season 2 shows growth in the series and by season 3 there were already some powerful moments, the clichéd dialogue was all but gone, the 'family drama' element was polished to 'family values' and so on  In conclusion, 'Arrow' is a series which in my opinion starts off very shaky and even irritating but gets more stable and interesting as the seasons progress  Give it a chance, and if you somehow get through the first season - enjoy the ride! Rating 7 - because of bad first season, but still high rating for the overall series  ",7,0.2,7.2,"Positive"
"Arrow","2015-07-02"," It had a good start, but I wouldn't recommend starting to watch it if you're one for pointing out inconsistencies  Maybe I had high expectations after watching Netflix's Daredevil, but this one seemed overly dramatic and repetitive  The formula  catching the bad guys in one episode and the big bad boss after a whole season  with a dash of drama and toxic love triangles, squares and hexagons seems to go for every season  The intro should be changed to  My name is Oliver Drama Queen and I've been stranded on an island with the only interesting plot (up until the 2nd season anyway) in the whole series   4/10 because they tried and Stephen Amell is eye candy  ",4,-0.2,3.8,"Negative"
"Arrow","2015-06-29"," His name is Oliver Queen, presumed dead he (allegedly) spent 5 years on an Island, now DCs most badass, ruthless hero has returned to Gotha  I mean Starling City and he's here to kick some serious bad guy ass Wait, most badass hero? Surely that title belongs to Batman right? What makes Arrow more badass than Batman? The fact that he kills people, not just when he has to but sometimes for the sake of it  It is so refreshing to see that  Sit back and enjoy the amazing fight choreography that will have you at the edge of your seat  Watch Oliver Queen keep up his playboy persona whilst battling Starlings worst criminals Be relieved that they skip past the origin story and get straight to him being The Arrow    but if you're the 1% who actually cares about what happened on the Island, enjoy the origin story in the form of weekly flashbacks showing how Gothams   damn I mean Starlings greatest playboy becomes the most ruthless Hero on DCs roster  Watch him hunt down the people who targeted his corrupt family and tried to kill him, as he uncovers the  unpredictable  story that you will see coming from a mile away With a perfect mixture of awesome characters, such has his mother, sister, Diggle, his driver turned bodyguard turned lover  His sidekick and not love interest Felicity Smoak who is the comic relief but never is it ever hinted that he loves her or she loves him at all  In this world where superpowers don't exist and will never ever exist according to our very reliable and competent writers, watch our Emerald Archer face off against The Dark Archer and his evil plan to do something very evil on a very large evil scale of evilness! But that's just Season One! Then comes the rest of the show where they take away all the things that made Arrow unique and get rid of them! Except the flashbacks, nah they are still coming in and they are coming in strong baby Cringe, while you watch the main characters comic book love story sidelined so the writer can force another love story that makes no sense at all onto the fans because they get writing cues from their teenage daughters Watch this Batman wannabe try so hard and fail at doing what Batman does naturally  Die a little bit inside while the writers destroy the most ruthless Villains from the DC universe and make them into Angst filled caricatures of themselves Just when you think the show is at the worst it could be, the writers throw season 3 at ya  Where you want to kill yourself just so you don't have to be around to witness how they butcher all the characters and bring one silly blonde to the forefront and give her silly illogical story lines that will make you want to scream and question your own sanity  Watch the competent writers destroy yet another DC Super Villain and blatantly steal stories from Batman, literally the stuff that happens to Batman happens to this guy  Whereas in Batman you feel he is worthy, whereas you just want to chuck your remote at this guy So my advice, watch Season One and suffer through Season Two, then play Russian Roulette, if you survive then watch Daredevil instead  ",9,-0.5,8.5,"Positive"

"Arrow","2015-06-07"," When I first began watching Arrow, I thought it was essentially a superhero soap opera  If they re-did the first season with Latin American actors, it would become an instant telenovela success on Telemundo  I was ready to rate Arrow 6 out of 10 stars initially for the excessive gimmicks seen in season one But season two absolutely blew me away  You could definitely tell how much the show as a whole evolved just after watching a few episodes  The story, characters as well as character development, and plot were incredibly well-written  It almost felt like I was watching an entirely different show  Season two was so well done that it earned the show an overall 8 out of 10 from me, and I sincerely hope they remain consistent going into season three  ",8,0.4,8.4,"Positive"

"Arrow","2015-06-02"," What I mean by my summary is that is this for the Superhero fan? Yes! Is it for a teenager? Yes! But me being a life long super hero fan, there is too much  teenie bopper  love material injected throughout this series  Not enough to steer a super hero fan away (for most)  But it is there and I find myself having an off-screen experience with an eye-roll  Hope that makes sense  I like shows like the new Daredevil series that is a total escape  One that doesn't even allow you to think of any reality  This series Arrow misses the mark in that respect   BUT it is still entertaining enough to keep me coming back The acting & possibly directing are a little off here  The conversations are awkward  Especially when one gets a phone call  Queue the awkward  I need to get this!   No one does this in real life to the frequency it happens here  There are quite a bit of awkward exchanges that just don't flow well  But there is definitely some eye candy in this series  Very pretty women   and best I can tell as a guy, Oliver Green (Stephen Amell) seems to be a nice looking dude  This tied with a superhero series and a solid storyline    I'll keep watching  ",6,0.7,6.7,"Positive"

"Arrow","2015-05-31"," The first few episodes are good in that we learn the hero's back story, his need for vengeance and teasers on how he became a weak playboy to a fearless, strong vigilante  We also meet a few characters that are sure to be future heroes/villains as the series develops and the episodes delve into each character's backgrounds and current/future interests  This show suffers from a dramatic screenplay as the main and side characters worry about their feelings much like a soap opera or elementary school playground would feel  Add to that the unreal and overdone effects of cannon fodder enemies that can never hit anyone with any type of gun and a ridiculous concept that a normal bow can withstand the blow of strong kicks or swords and still fire with 100% accuracy  The show literally had a few gang members toting semi-automatic guns, firing at Oliver nearly 10-15 yards and could not land a single hit; but, Oliver always gets injured by the main enemy or a much less harmful enemy/neutral character  I would still stand the plot holes and ridiculous action scenes if it weren't for the acting and soap opera feel  Sorry, but I do not find Laurel attractive at all and the show always tries to capitalize on her as eye candy  As though they want to distract the male audience with the elephant in the room of bad writing, acting and let many drama scenes play out  ",3,-0.6,2.4,"Negative"

"Arrow","2015-05-23"," Let me start off by saying the first two seasons were great  Season 1 set up all the characters, and introduced us to characters from the DC universe at a reasonable pace  The action was good, the acting was occasionally off-putting, but mostly solid  Season 2 upped everything tremendously  The villain, Slade Wilson (AKA Deathstroke) was incredibly well-acted, physically menacing and he had understandable motivation  To him, Oliver had killed the love of his life and he wanted to take an eye for an eye, somewhat literally in this case  His actions also had lasting repercussions, seeing as he murdered Oliver's mother and devastated the city with what amounted to super-soldiers  Season 3 looked to continue the trend  However, one thing in particular seemed to spoil these good vibes: The Oliver/Felicity relationship that carried over from the season 2 finale  It turned Felicity, a strong, smart and all-around admirable female character, into someone who was only there so she could provide moral opposition to Oliver's actions  Not only that, but it reeked of nothing but fan-service  Felicity clearly had something for Oliver since the beginning, but there had been no sign of those feelings being reciprocated  Ra's Al Ghul was a great villain, and the mid-season fight between him and Oliver was great, but his death was very underwhelming  It also broke all suspension of disbelief when Oliver was stabbed in the sternum and kicked off of what looked like a 40+ foot drop and yet could survive without any permanent injury! One more personal gripe is how the show screams,  We're dark and edgy, there is no such thing as fun  all the time  The only instance in which I can recall Laurel smiling is when she crossed over into the Flash show  Also, correct me if I am wrong, all of the action in the show takes place in the dead of night, aside from the flashbacks  This seems like it might change with season 4, but I think Daredevil nailed the right balance of humour and grittiness I adored the first two seasons, and I was a fan of the third up until the 2/3 mark or so  It is a great show, at least for the first two seasons, and those aforementioned seasons are a must- watch to me, as long as you are a fan of superheroes  ",8,0.2,8.2,"Positive"

"Arrow","2015-05-19"," I was hesitant to write this review, but because for some time now follow this show, I decided nevertheless to write Show was interesting at first, entertaining although it encountered a series of boring episodes  Also, the constant repetition of  I'm here to protect you  which repeats at least 5 times in each episode is really annoying  Dramatic effects are poor    I really do not like forced scenario, only for dramatic effects  The culmination of the drama queens is Thea Queen  Her acting is pretty bad  Similar is with Felicity whose role is  funny , where she is a hacker, doctor, engineer    and she is not look like that at all  How she hacks and doing her job is at least ridiculous  After watching the first episode of season 4 I completely lost interest in this series  Everything turned into hog wash  I almost fell asleep  Dialogues are so bad, skinny Thea throws heavy people in truck like they are made of paper   idiocy  The idea that everyone wanna be super heroes in general does not make it interesting and is very boring  the characters have lost their meaning and role  No character is no longer interesting, even Arrow  Just a pity that there is material much better, but they blew it with excessive drama and stupid (meaningless) dialogues  Boring    ",3,-1.1,1.9,"Negative"
"Arrow","2015-05-18"," Arrow is the best show I have ever watched  Oliver Queen is a beast in this show  For instance he taps like every chick in that show and fights like a beast  Another beast character in this show is Malcom Merlyn and Deathstroke  When Deathstroke went to prison, that was one of the most sadder points of the show  However, the good news is that Malcom Merlyn is still in the show and still is a beast  However, by the most recent episodes, it seems like Malcom is not going to be in the show as much anymore  However, my least favorite character is Felicity  She is a total bit*h who gets friend zoned by Oliver constantly throughout the show, but still wants to blow him, and for some stupid reason the makers of arrow decided that it was a good idea to have Oliver bone felicity and run away with her in the season finale, so felicity probably did blow him  Also this is stupid because Felicity is a ugly w*ore, whereas Laurel is pretty hot and arrow should re-bone her, cause she is definitely hotter than Felicity  Also he should have boned Isabel Rochev more in season 2 cause she was also hot  Speaking of things Roy is also a super raw character  I am just pi*sed that Roy left in season 3 cause he was cool, but at least he got the opportunity to bang Thea, who is also hot  For these reasons most of the girls in this shows are pretty hot, but they should keep adding hotter girls because ye  Another one of my favorite characters other than Arrow, Malcom, Deathstroke(Slade Wilson), Roy Harper, is Deadshot  That was also a very saddening part in the show when Deadshot died, but at least he died doing what he loved, which was killing people  Another person who I like is John Diggle, because he is kind of the wise guy of team arrow  Also he always says  let's throttle back , which I find hilarious, so I lol a lot whenever he says that  Another character I like is Laurel, because when she had a drug problem in season 2, that was really funny cause she was so annoying, even though she got uglier in season 2, but I guess that is the downside to doing drugs in the show  Also in season 3 she is hilarious when she is the black canary and constantly gets her a*s kicked  I think of Laurel as like the commedic aspect of the show as well as her dad who is old and sucks at fighting also  Also the irony in season 1 was awesome, like when Tommy says that Oliver needs to get laid cause he has not taped anything in 5 years but little did Tommy know, Oliver boned at least 2 chicks multiple times in the island, Sara and Shado  Personally I think he could probably do better than Sara but I guess he did not have many options on the island but he should not have boned her back in Starling City because ye  However, I am a bit disappointed in the fact that Thea and Oliver are not related because if they were not they would totally bone  So I hope I find out that they are not related, so its not gross if they bone  Finally, I think that the whole idea of the canary is stupid because it is derived from Sara who also sucked at fighting and fought with a stupid a*s pole  However, overall, arrow is the best show ever created and I hope they keep airing seasons until arrow is like 80 years old because that would be funny to see some old guy with back problems beat up a bunch of thugs  ",10,0.5,10,"Positive"

"Arrow","2015-05-15"," There's a whole lot I really love about Arrow  Unfortunately, the writers continue to dilute the greatness with feeble clichés and annoying, character-breaking contrivances  These keep Arrow from being the classic show it could so easily be One thing that Arrow gets absolutely right are the dark, moody visuals  The series looks exactly the way it should - it's worth watching just for the great photography  Also worthwhile: the impeccable staging of the action scenes  The archery, the swordplay, the fist fights - everything feels real  This is swashbuckling done right Then there's the casting  Blond, square-jawed Stephen Amell looks much too good to be true, but, amazingly, he's got the personality to carry off his difficult role  He's believable as Oliver Queen, self-centered rich boy, and equally believable as Arrow, the merciless vigilante  The rest of the cast is pretty solid as well, but Emily Bett Rickards tends to steal the show as Felicity Smoak  It seems as if her character has been built up more than originally intended  Her likable, upbeat quality makes a perfect counterbalance to the Arrow's brooding ego Finally, the big season-spanning story lines are elaborate and reasonably clever  Alternating the present-day story with flashbacks to Oliver Queen's 'lost' five years is a bit of a contrivance, but it works  We get two stories for the price of one, and we get to see Queen's character from two points of view On the downside, there's just one problem: the endless, needless, melodramatic ANGST The writers of Arrow seem to think that the hissy fit is the highest achievement of Shakespearean dramatics  Unfortunately, having everyone act like drama queens isn't the same as actual drama  These are supposed to be *strong* characters, yet they frequently lapse into behavior that would seem embarrassing in a kindergarten class for spoiled brats A recent example (not much of a spoiler, even if you haven't see the third season finale): when Diggle finds out that Oliver has been working an elaborate deception, his first reaction is to get into a snit because HE wasn't told about it  This is a tough, mean, military dude  But instead of being relieved that his best friend hasn't been as completely off the rails as he seemed, Diggle is miffed because Queen dared to concoct a plot without letting him know  Oh, please!This happens not just regularly, but incessantly  In just about every episode, every character has a scene or two where they have a demeaning, vomit-inducing whine about some terrible affront that's been done to them   Never mind that I've just been saved from the League of Assassins, the deadliest killers on Earth - nasty old Oliver told me a fib!! Wah, wah, poor little me!  Sometimes, supposedly mature characters (especially the tough veteran cop, Quentin Lance) maintain this kind of sniveling, juvenile attitude for many episodes, over some trivial circumstance that doesn't even qualify as a significant plot point Despite this, I'm still a fan of the show  I think I deserve a lot of credit for that! I've managed to tune out all the whining, by gritting my teeth and occasionally closing my eyes  The fact that I've gone to those lengths is a testament to the really excellent aspects of this series  And, fortunately, there have been long stretches where actual plot takes over from the melodrama  That's when the true potential of Arrow shines through I've just read that Arrow is slated to return for a fourth season  Wouldn't it be great if the writers grew up a bit over the summer, and found more adult ways for their characters to interact? If they did, Arrow could be a true classic UPDATE: I'm revising my original 7/10 rating, all the way down to 2/10  Far from improving, this show has devolved into uninterrupted cliché and painfully contrived characterizations  Feeble on every level  Avoid  ",2,0.3,2.3,"Negative"

"Arrow","2014-10-03"," *This is a review for the the Seasons 1 and 2 of Arrow *Minor spoilers for Seasons 1 & 2 presentAs you may know, Arrow is a show based off of the Green Arrow & The DC Comics Universe  As a big fan of the DC universe, I was a little sketchy after seeing bits and pieces of the 1st season on TV  In the short term it seemed like the Punisher with a bow & arrow, however that was before I sat down and watched the whole show After watching two seasons of Arrow, I can happily say that Arrow is the most faithful live- action adaptation of the DC Universe to date  Sure it makes a few changes (the biggest being the characterization of Green Arrow), however over all Arrow has the stories, characters, super-powers, and the overall feeling of a huge expanded universe that DC fans have loved since 1938 The characters on Arrow are (for the most part) intriguing and faithful to the comics  Firstly, there is Oliver Queen, The Arrow, played by Stephen Amell  From the beginning, Oliver has a sense of mystery to him  At first he seems very different from his comic book counter-part, however as the story unfolds you begin to realize that he is headed there  It takes a few episodes for the actor to warm up to the role, but once he does, you begin to root for him and understand the decisions he makes  However, the Arrow does not fight alone as he has partners in John Diggle (David Ramsey), Felicity Smoak (Emily Bett Richards) & Roy Harper (Colton Haynes)  Each character mentioned is a great character that adds to the show, and has you rooting for them as much as you are The Arrow  DC fans will not recognize Diggle or Felicity (unless your a die-hard Firestorm fan) as they are made up for the show  However, not to worry as they are some of the best characters on the show  DC Fans will of course recognize Roy Harper, as the Green Arrow's side-kick Speedy (or Arsenal or Red Arrow)  Many fans of the show do not enjoy this character, however he is one of my personal favorite and I love what Roy adds to the show (he is also the only person to ever argue with Arrow, witch I love) That being said a show is only as good as it's villains, luckily Arrow has great villains  There have been many villains on Arrow, however I am only going to talk about the main 2 for the sake of time  (That being said, I must add that Deadshot, Brother Blood, Nyssa Al Ghul, & The Dollmaker are all great villains as well)  The big bad of season one is (spoilers for any one not past episode 9) Merlyn, The Dark Archer  Merlyn's story is changed a bit  However, it is for the better as The Merlyn of the show is a much better character than the Merlyn of the comics  John Barrowman adds a certain charisma to Merlyn that makes you exited every-time he is on the screen  The villain of season 2 is (spoilers for Season 2) Deathstroke  Most of Slade's backstory is intact in the show  Even though his motivations are a little sketchy, Manu Bennet represents Deathstoke as the intimidating, venganful, and bad-ass character that we all know and love from the comics so all is forgiven However, Arrow is not perfect  The 1st 7-8 episodes are engaging, but can be off-putting to some and not leave a good impression  However, I highly recommend that you stick with the show as it gets leagues better for the last half of Season 1 & All Of Season 2  The other main problem with Arrow is the Lance sisters, Laurel & Sara  It seems like the writer's just don't know what to do with Laurel  Although, Katie Cassidy tries her hardest to make the character work, the way the writers handle her is pretty brutal  I really hope they fix her for Season 3 (though they seem to be on the right track as I know she will be training with Wildcat)  Sara has the opposite problem  The way she is written is usually pretty good, however the actress who plays her is just awful  Some of her line delivery is literally unbearable, to the point where she actually ruined an episode (S02E15, The Promise) for me Overall, Arrow is a fun show and a great adaptation of the DCU that I look forward to watching every week, and I would gladly encourage any DC fan to check out Arrow to see there favorite characters such as The Flash, Deathstroke, Arsenal, The League Of Assasians, Deadshot & The Suicide Squad done justice on screen *Also, I would just like to encourage everyone to like Stephen's facebook page as he is honestly the kindest, most down to earth I have ever seen  His donations to various charities is honestly amazing  Also, he reveals little tidbits of info on upcoming Arrow episodes as well  ",9,0.9,9.9,"Positive"
"Arrow","2014-09-19"," I wasn't expecting much from this show in the beginning, but I was pleasantly surprised  The scenes are short, tight and pack a punch  There is rarely a slack moment and the plot lines have considerable emotional resonance  As is typical of CW shows, it's full of gorgeous twenty- somethings with perfect cheekbones and impeccably coiffed hair, but that's just a bonus In two seasons, Arrow has gone from strength to strength  The villain-of-the-week episodes are now interwoven with long-running story lines  Some of the second season episodes--Keep Your Enemies Closer, Three Ghosts, and Tremors--stand out as some of the best pieces of television in the last seven or eight years  Though they occasionally veer too far into comic-bookiness, the stories have become even more compelling<U+0097>in fact, sometimes I even wish there were more character scenes and fewer fights It never ceases to amaze how the showrunners manage to squeeze the maximum out of a TV budget every single week  Not since Miami Vice has there been a show that aimed for--and so often achieved--the ideal of a TV series as an hour-long mini-movie, delivered once a week for the viewer's delectation  Often big-budget Hollywood movies feel bloated and weighed-down by all the money spent on special effects; Arrow is freed, its creativity stimulated, by the need to work within a smaller budget  The visuals are gritty and imaginative and the fight scenes are always wonderful to watch Unlike most CW shows (ahem, Smallville) which aim for a more emo sensibility, or the angry-young-man nihilism which afflicted Nolan's Batman movies, Arrow strikes a more mature tone  Themes of loyalty, revenge, love, honor, family ties, sibling rivalries, friendship, betrayal, Oedipal struggle, motherhood, absent fathers, guilt, redemption, class struggle, the dichotomy between the mask one wears and one's true self, and more--pulp fiction it may be, but treated with loving care by the writers, showrunners, and actors  This combination of heightened emotional intensity with the comic book mythos elevates Arrow to something like opera: a world of stylized, epic, larger-than-life conflicts, but which is still recognizably human and compelling  And it's addictive The powers that be at CW have fortunately renewed the series for a third season and I'm eager to see if they can manage to take the story of Oliver Queen to new heights  I hope the show runs as long as they can make it interesting  ",9,0.5,9.5,"Positive"

"Arrow","2014-09-10"," Solid start to what could--and maybe should--be a future CW franchise  Your interest in Arrow depends on how much you miss the troubled-in-love, conflicted-by-family heroics of Smallville--it mirrors that series' setup  The pilot of Arrow is a darkly gleaming gem  If the show can keep up its cinema-quality action sequences and maintain an air of mystery to Ollie's agenda, this could be a really fun series  Arrow has a rather stylish neo-Goth look, and Stephen Amell (who played a dim-bulb gigolo in Hung) neatly balances his portrayal of Arrow between camp and Saturday-matinée ingenuousness  There's nothing particularly new about a superhero show, but Arrow exhibits a stylized ferocity that, in its initial hour at least, makes a positive enough impression  Arrow may not be a-point-meant television  But for starters at least, it's a sharper little tale than expected  ",8,0.4,8.4,"Positive"
"Arrow","2014-09-07"," I only recently discovered the series and just love Arrow! But love it even more when watching it on DVD, because then I can just forward through all of Laurel's scenes  I wonder if the creators feel sorry for the actress and that's why they can't kill her character?

"Arrow","2014-09-05"," The first series was great with plenty of action and a reasonable storyline  Then in series two, the action scenes got sanitised and the storyline was adapted to reduce the amount of killing and the Arrow became an idiot whose snap decisions always play into the hands of the baddies  A pitiful storyline and plenty of overacting means episodes became cringe-worthy  I don't know exactly how these series are managed, but it seems that after the first series, Arrow has been assigned lazy script writers who judging by the amount of melodrama and teenage angst, previously wrote for 90210! Arrow has entered the realm of comedy with one character pointing a shotgun and calling somebody an  asshat , presumably for the benefit of viewers that get offended by strong language    sheesh! I got sick of characters second guessing themselves and entering stupidity loops,  Oh, if only I hadn't told that lie then everything would be OK, so now I'll tell another lie and that'll sort it out  Oh no, if only I hadn't told that second lie then everything would be OK, so now I'll tell another lie     you get the picture    Repeated historical revelations used to provide storyline twists became tiresome, as they ended up being predictable as lazy story artefacts always do  Bottom line is that the IQ of Arrow has dropped significantly so if you're new to it, watch the first series then move on and forget it  ",5,-0.6,4.4,"Negative"

Arrow is a great mix of multiple genres, it is action packed and exciting, yet emotional and can be a little romantic  The casting in this show is so perfect, Stephen Amell is the perfect actor for Oliver as he is a park our expert and does all his own stunts making this show realistic  This show has a great soundtrack as well as a great catch line  You will find yourself quoting this show  There are those people that will say they don't like this show and I really don't understand them and wouldn't listen to them  This show is exciting for anyone, almost addicting!

"Arrow","2014-08-14"," If you take the time to notice, all of the bad user ratings are from users that only watched the first 3 episodes  The story has to be set up and of course the first 3 episodes of every show is a little rocky  Once the show gets in the mode of things and the plot develops, the show burns into an intense crazy fire of a plot that will be the only thing on your mind for weeks  It's a fantastic show with fantastic writing and a very talented and carefully chosen cast  Give it a chance  Though the story is very much not the same as the comic series green arrow, I would never imagine it any other way  This portrayal is very dense and contains many possibilities to branch out  Personally I think it is the best thing to happen to DC since Batman  ",10,-0.3,9.7,"Positive"

(and stayed up last night watching 8 episodes in a row!)Season 1 was exciting, but in Season 2, while the writers upped the stakes ante; during the last few episodes, Oliver/The Arrow began to become really foolish in his decision-making :( Your reticence to do what is necessary, is why your city burns!  To me, Nyssa summed up Oliver and Season 2 pretty well While i love many of the supporting characters like Felicity, Roy, Sara, Tommy, Detective Lance and Diggle, it was really annoying to see how the skillful Oliver Queen turns out to be such an elementary playboy, (he actually slept with his father's mistress!!) and making more and more useless decisions that leave dear ones suffering  A disappointing lead character to root for  ",9,0,9,"Positive"
"Arrow","2014-08-07"," I am entirely surprised as to this shows rating  At this moment in time the rating is at a 8 2  This compared to a show like Deadwood which is at a 8 9 Now Deadwood was an examination in the creation of civilization out of a savage land  Filled to the brim with good actors inhabiting multifaceted and complex characters that touted amazing dialog Could one expect some of the same from Arrow  One could but only with ensuing disappointment I have now seen the first season and I won't be moving forward with season 2  Granted this 2nd season might take a quantum leap in quality  But I highly doubt it As a lot have pointed out  Arrow is basically Batman Begins in TV form  This could've been exciting if it weren't for the huge difference in quality I love characters  Unfortunately these characters pretty one dimensional even though they do evolve slightly over the cause of season one  Unfortunately they never really become real people because of their one note personalities  The show tries to create complexity but fails  It doesn't help that the actors for the most part aren't particularly fantastic  The chemistry between the supposed friends, lovers, family members also leave a lot to be desired  Needless to say I had a hard time finding a real character to empathize with The dialog is very stiff and unengaging, which again doesn't help when the different characters are struggling with finding chemistry with each other The plots are for the most parts predictable and clichéd  It's like the writers have studied a very traditional story model and lack the fantasy to try something new  There are plot holes abound and more than a few unexplained events Not everything is bad  As the show does manage to create a hook for the viewer  A hook that would've worked better if the characters had been deeper and easier to sympathize with  The show reveals new tidbits about the main protagonists road to becoming Arrow for every episode  Which is a pretty good hook instead of the formulaic setup of finding a new villain for every episode But for the most part this show, at least through season 1, is a lackluster and clichéd outing with one note characters and forgettable plot  ",3,0.2,3.2,"Negative"

"Arrow","2014-05-07"," I have a strange relationship with the DC Comics non-super-powered superhero (or costumed crime-fighter/vigilante, if you want to be vulgar) the Green Arrow, created in 1941 by Mort Weisinger and George Papp, and who first appeared in  More Fun Comics #73  I first read of the Green Arrow about five years ago when he was first teamed up with the Hal Jordan version of the Green Lantern in an acclaimed - albeit short - run of ground-breaking, socially-conscious comics by comic book artists Neal Adams and Denny O'Neill  In researching the character further, I've found that up until the acclaimed Silver Age  Green Lantern/Green Arrow  stories, that the Green Arrow was regarded as a second- or third-tier superhero (an  archer-themed Batman,  if you STILL want to be vulgar), until Neal Adams gave the character a much-needed image overhaul in 1969, making him  rougher, darker, and edgier  and a spokesman for the under-privileged in American society (and left-wing politics, if you still want to bother being vulgar) After that, the last I heard of the Green Arrow - who is routinely regarded as the finest archer superhero comics has ever seen, perhaps only to be rivaled by Marvel Comics' Hawkeye - was quite sporadically over the following years in my own curious personal research of the character, and then I heard about The CW's new TV series  Arrow  Of course, due to my work schedule at the time, I had missed any chance of seeing the show when it aired on TV  So with the wonder of TV-on-DVD, I finally got the chance to watch it  One thing I was afraid of going in, was that the producers would take a  Dark Knight  approach to it to make the show  dark & edgy,  as is all the rage these days regarding superhero movies and TV shows  Thankfully, I knew beforehand that the Green Arrow had gone the  Dark Knight  route a long time ago  Superhero movies/TV shows need to innovate, not imitate, each other, if it is a genre to continue being one of the last places for truly original and innovative filmmaking In watching  Arrow,  it is obviously inspired by the Neal Adams-Denny O'Neill Silver Age revision of the character that made the Green Arrow a much more dangerous and rougher superhero than he was when he first debuted during the Golden Age of comics, in addition to some of the more recent  Green Arrow  comic book stories (penned most famously by Mike Grell)  At the beginning of  Arrow,  billionaire Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell) returns to Starling City after being marooned on an island in the South China Sea for five years Five years before, Oliver was an irresponsible, reckless playboy with no ambition and who had cheated with the now-deceased sister of his girlfriend Dinah Laurel Lance (Katie Cassidy), whose cop-father Detective Quentin Lance (Paul Blackthorne) also holds a strong animosity toward him  Upon his return to Starling City, he's come back to civilization a changed man and with an agenda to take down the individual members of the city's wealthy elite who have corrupted it  Donning a green hood and a bow & arrow, he thus becomes the Green Arrow (though in an effort to make this series more  realistic,  I guess, he is never referred to out-right as  the Green Arrow,  and is instead often called  the Hood  or similar), a modern-day Robin Hood (who, like the Democrats - according to one character - steals from the rich and gives back to the poor) who's aided in his dangerous battle against crime with his former bodyguard John Diggle (David Ramsey) at his side, as well as IT geek-girl Felicity Smoak (Emily Bett Rickards)  Arrow  is a good show to get into, if you're one for superhero movies and TV shows with a dark, menacing edge  For the record, I'm not, except for when it fits the character  I like dark comic book superheroes (and violent anti-heroes) like Batman, The Crow, The Punisher, or Spawn just fine and without any problems whatsoever  When the Green Arrow became a  darker, edgier  character, that was one of the few character revisions that I feel actually made the character a much better and more intimidating comic book superhero presence I can honestly say that I'm waiting to see where this series goes in the future 9/10 ",9,-0.2,8.8,"Positive"

"Arrow","2014-05-02"," When I first started watching Arrow, I thought it was pretty good, but as I kept watching I realized the plot is somewhat familiar  That's right, Arrow is basically The Dark Knight Trilogy, but in a TV series  Oliver Queen a playboy millionaire that owns a successful company? Sound Familiar? It should because that's Bruce Wayne  They both went off the grid for a period of time and came back with survival and fighting skills to defend their city from crime  Now I know that's not the shows fault for having similar backgrounds, it's DC's  If you watch the show you'll understand this: 1) Oliver Queen = Bruce Wayne: No explaining needed 2) John Diggle = Alfred Pennyworth: They both act as their conscious 3) Felicity Smoak = Lucius Fox: High Tech people who get them what they need whether it's a new suit or hacking into something 4) Count Vertigo: wannabe Joker: Though Vertigo plays a smaller role, you could see the similarities in personalities 5) Isabel Rochev = Talia Al Ghul (Miranda): Act like the superhero's friend/lover and ends up backstabbing them 6) Malcom Merlyn = Ra's Al Ghul: The undertaking = Ra's Al Ghul's plan to destroy Gothom and start from the feet up (Black Canary)Sara Lance = Catwoman (Selena Kyle): Sara Lance acts as Oliver Queen's lover/ accomplice while Catwoman in the Dark Knight Trilogy is only an accomplice, though in The end of The Dark Knight Rises, you see Selena Kyle with Bruce Wayne 7) Officer John Blake (Robin) = Roy Harper (Speedy): Roy does have a bigger role especially now since he's been injected with the Mirukuru 8) Mayor Blood = Dr  Crane (Scarecrow)/ Two-Face (Harvey Dent): wears a similar mask to the scarecrow, used drugs on people and are both corrupt while appearing to be one of the  good guys   Also Mayor blood is well, the mayor and Dent was the DA plus they both dated/had a thing with the superhero's ex-lover 9) Slade Wilson (DeathStroke) = Bane: though they have different motives, they have pretty similar goals, they want to destroy something  Bane wants to destroy Gothom while Wilson wants to destroy Queen  They both work with the backstabbing girls 10) Quentin Lance = Jim Gordon, officers that work with  vigilantes  even though they're not supposed to 11) Laurel Lance = Rachael Dawes, both of them are ex-lovers The only reason why this show got a 5 and not lower is because I absolutely loved the Dark Knight Trilogy  It would've gotten a higher rating maybe if the CGI and acting was better  ",5,0,5,"Negative"

"Arrow","2014-03-29"," Arrow starts off well and is, for the most part, quite entertaining  The story of the origins of the Arrow in season 1 is very compelling, but the present day is not as interesting  As the first season rolls into the 2nd there's some interesting character development for Oliver/Arrow as he moves into a more traditional comic book hero  The first 10 episodes of that season(2) are the best of the show  They bring in a lot of good aspects from the DC universe  Unfortunately they start to go downhill again in the later part of season 2  The biggest problem the show has is the dialogue and the way characters express themselves  No character ever keeps anything to themselves that isn't an established secret  Rather than just feeling something the character always has to, often needlessly, express it in words *minor spoilers* In the later part of season 2 there's been a cross into what I'd call 'insultingly stupid' occurrences  There's an episode involving a drone strike where a military drone is flying 10 feet off the ground, down a street for example  Felicity the computer specialist is frequently involved in the plot of an episode  The quality/enjoyment of the episodes are often damaged by how terrible writing is on with anything involving computers  The worst offence being a villainous computer expert hacking into computer equipment and making it explode  (A writing device I'd hope we'd left in the past many years ago) Overall the show is just barley worth watching  It's a bit of a mixed- bag on an episode-to-episode basis  It has its good moments and some good characters, but has some problems reconciling a dark/gritty tone with its Green Arrow and DC universe roots  ",6,-0.3,5.7,"Negative"
"Arrow","2014-03-28"," We are now past the halfway point of Season 2 and I can say for sure that  Arrow  is the best superhero series ever and one of the best series in television  Arrow is a realistic take on the hooded vigilante Green Arrow (seemingly influenced by Nolan's  The Dark Knight  Trilogy) and it proves to be exactly what we needed  The story of the show is exiting, suspenseful and manages to keep the adrenaline high on every second of an episode  The episodes themselves, connect very well to one another and we can see their relevance in the main continuity more and more as we approach the Season 2  Finale   The characters are interesting and all are well- developed  Each and everyone of them have their place in the show and we can see everyone in a shining moment  Also, Arrow does a great work with it's villains always managing to offer the hero and his team quite the challenge  The show's characters might differ in some ways from the comics in order to fit into this more realistic world, but this is done in a way that doesn't irritate comic book fans and keeps the average viewer interested  But for the hardcore fans, many famous comic book characters are introduced Finally, Arrow's effects work really well  Choosing to use practical effects over CGI was a very good decision helping both the realistic look and the visual appeal of the show  The costumes look good and also match the tone  The soundtrack fits the episodes perfectly and, while it isn't a masterpiece, is still pretty nice For me personally  Arrow is the best series on television, along with  Game of Thrones  and thats why it gets a straight 10/10 (Masterpiece) rating  ",10,1.8,10,"Positive"
"Arrow","2014-03-19"," First I just watched 2-3 episodes  Then it got interesting  I continued it  The I got addicted to it  Even I know it seems a mixture of superman, batman, spider man series      but still it takes you a journey of a survivor  And best part is the plot which keeps you bonded as you just want to know what happened on that island  There are times when some episodes are really boring, but even though in next episode it recovers  Sometimes it lacks humor, but it is upon Felecity to fill out those gaps  I think she is trying her best  Stephen Amell completely justify his character  And for Paul Blackthorne, he is absolutely great  Maybe some viewers think it as same concept, but still execution is different & worth watching  ",7,0.2,7.2,"Positive"

"Arrow","2014-03-09"," While watching the first series of Arrow I noticed how many vigilante story clichés there are in it  I won't name any because I will give it away  However the majority of these clichés are played in a slightly different way which does not make them annoying to watch  The actors all do good jobs, I have not come across a character I've disliked yet, although no extremely lovable characters have yet, the closest being the original bodyguard  The script isn't as realistic as some other shows, it doesn't sound truly natural, but not to an annoying point  Also this version of Green Arrow is very much like Batman, no real wisecracks from our hero, just intimidation and darkness, although with the backstory given these would be somewhat out of place  The story is intriguing, and always keeps me interested, it really is a fantastic take on the Green Arrow story  Finally, what I adore about this show which puts it up to a 9, the action sequences are fantastic, when Arrow is Arrow something awesome always happens, and the costume is fantastic  The fight scenes are all very tense and I really enjoy watching them  I recommend this show as it is enjoyable and provides an interesting story  But not before you check out Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones, even if you are a DC comics fan like myself  ",8,0.7,8.7,"Positive"

"Arrow","2014-03-05"," Most overrated show I've seen, ever I know that a lot of TV is awful, but gets swallowed up because people do not venture far from the mainstream, dumbed down, hypnotic crap which constantly flows through the screen like a sewage pipe  However, I did not know that the amount of people, who are this uncultured and blind to any critical thought was this huge IMDb used to be (still is in many cases, it's a good site either way) a reliable source for figuring out whether a show/film was worth looking into, put seeing the high ratings of Arrow (which is 8 2 at the time of this being written) and the latest Hunger Games movie, I've lost hope The spoiler free premise: Rich brat kid goes on a boat trip with his dad, he's got a coke problem and lacks moral and discipline Boat sinks, everyone dies except him  He manages to maroon himself on an island, during this time he somehow manages to survive without any food nor drinking water (and probably with some bad coke withdrawal symptoms)  He makes a bow out of what he can find on the island, gets really good at hunting animals and survives long enough for another ship to find him Well, this doesn't seem too bad, leaving out some of the back-story and other revelations of course But for some reason, he is now a parkour master, with martial arts skills, hacking skills (did he practice on a homemade computer he built out of wood and bear skin or something, maybe he powered it by putting a propeller in a tube and farting really hard to make a wind-turbine?) Now, what he should have done on that island, is trained on his damn acting  Because it blows  If I was an actor in LA trying to make a name for myself, I would of bought the box-set and hit myself in the head repeatedly until I died from head trauma But if that isn't horrible enough, the entire cast share the most stale, unnatural, awful, awful acting abilities as the lead  It wouldn't have surprised me if the director got blown by every, single, member of the cast to be on this god forsaken show It's just so sad to see resources which could have fed starving children go to waste on this melodrama of an  action-show   Too bad dramas require acting, which the cast does not suffice to provide  It should be called  bags of skin who might actually be robots reciting the terrible writing of a talentless person on camera held by another talentless person who somehow managed to get payed and recognized in a extremely tough business  instead of acting in this case The style of this series is extremely similar to Smalville, with a lot of bright light and water drops in the eyes of the pretty female actresses to make them look better (which is the one thing they actually can do, for the most part), with the oily 80's pornflick filter and the half-arsed special effects  Though, Smallville actually being a half- decent show, gets a pass There was one scene I laughed out loud at (it wasn't actually the scenes where the director/writer intended it to be funny, because those scenes were so try-hard funny that I literally cringed), it was a scene where Mr  Arrow shoots an arrow next to this generic  bad guy's  head, the  bad guy  says:  Hah, you missed!  whereas Mr  Arrow replies  I didn't LOL   Apparently, he shot the the arrow (which actually had a flashdrive instead of a tip!) into the usb slot behind the  bad guy , which also contained a virus (which Mr  Arrow had taught himself to program on the island    or something?) which brought down the evil database, epic! Haha!Great writing indeed, no clichés included! I actually dislike this series so much, I feel good writing how awful it is, maybe I can discourage a single person to watch this lobotomy of a show and that would be enough to make me feel glad TL;DR:Horrendous acting  Cliché-ridden, awful, hole-ridden, unoriginal and uninspiring writing  Horrendous acting  Overrated by people who would drink the kool-aid as long as the trailer had explosions in it  Directing and special effects on high school film project standards (that's actually insulting to high schoolers, since they actually have creativity, sorry)  Acting, horrendous  Terrible makeup  Jokes and humour about as hilarious as reading obituaries Acting; horrendous  ",1,-1,1,"Negative"

"Arrow","2014-03-03"," I remember first hearing about this show when I saw it on the cover of entertainment weekly about two years ago  It didn't look like anything special so I didn't even care to read the article  Now, I own a netflix account and after going through series after series, I ran out of things to watch  So, I saw Arrow and I thought,  Well it has good reviews and I've heard good things from critics and my friends so, why not?  BEST DECISION I EVER MADE  This show is down right fantastic  I consider myself a critic when it comes to entertainment, and so does everyone I know  I do this so much, that some people find me annoying  So trust me when I tell you, this show is great  The acting can be iffy at times, but what it lacks there it makes up for in the action, love story, non stop suspense, and the amazing plot  I was not a fan of the Green Arrow comics, but I can tell you I am now  And I have to say this interpretation on this show is one of the single most greatest things I've ever had the chance to watch (besides for Breaking Bad, of course)  I'm on serious withdrawal from this show seeing as I just finished season one minutes ago on netflix and the first episodes from the second season (which I've heard is better than the first) are not on on demand  I am a huge fan of the comics of DC and video games, but I never really liked Green Arrow or even thought he was cool  After this, I can assure you I was so wrong  This show is a must see and if you think the beginning of the show is slow, I promise it gets better as it goes on  And apparently, the second season has developed into a actual good emmy award nominated show  Just look at the ratings compared from season one too now  I need more episodes so get on it Netflix because myself and many other fans cannot wait much longer  ",10,0.5,10,"Positive"

"Arrow","2014-03-01"," Being late (2014) to Arrow my interest was piqued by the mostly favorable blurbs on the usual internet haunts  Thus, I began with the first episode with high hopes  The idea of an everyman with near superman powers is immediately engaging  The back-story, overall, has promise if somewhat too sensationalized which is forgivable within the realm of comic book heroes come to life  That said, the high points would be the production values, the rich ambiance of the Starling City, the camera ready cast, and the idea of a Bruce Wayne young tycoon heir cum Arrow superhero  So, after only two installments I'm ready to criticize There's a wooden quality to the story here as it unfolds  Too predictable and trite? Quite possibly  Does anyone have likable chemistry? The way the writers have immediately alienated the Queen family is trying as it should be all wrapped in the joy where a prodigal son, thought to be dead, is suddenly very much alive  The intricacies of the in-fighting begins at once  The fight against the cardboard cut-out villains plays out in fast-forward forcing that bit of realism a real life superhero needs to bounce off of  I've read it improves as the series progresses to which I hold out guarded hope  The idea is for a real-life Robin Hood with elevated heroes is certainly not the problem  The early realization of this veers too far in the less than believable realm however  A less antagonistic real fight for right is what is called for  Plus does anyone believe a hood with some black out around the eyes is unrecognizable? More realism with some believable justice served is the ticket  I'll update this when I get through the entire season if I find something more compelling to warrant it  ",6,0.4,6.4,"Positive"

"Arrow","2014-02-22"," Initially after seeing the pilot I was a bit skeptical  The acting was sub par and to some extent I thought the special effects were slightly cheesy  Then I watched a few more episodes and boy was I hooked  This is an excellent take on the Green Arrow, a fresh perspective on a superhero with a penchant for violence which of course is absolutely necessary when dealing with deadly criminals  There is no room for compunction no room for morality like most superheros have  Absolute justice means taking lives and mercifully the creators of the show have taken creative license and bestowed the license to kill on their green arrow  And that is where the show triumphs  Also I quite liked the way the rest of the characters are been given screen time and are being allowed to develop  It isn't only about Oliver, the show is about the choices he makes and the way it effects people around him  On the whole I am quite happy with the direction the show is taking  Lets hope it stays this way  ",10,0.1,10,"Positive"
"Arrow","2014-02-20"," For all those bashing this show, they clearly don't understand what it is all about  First of all, People saying that it is a Nolan Ripoff just don't understand the character  Green Arrow in the comics, in his lore, is similar to Batman  They have similar back stories, are returning billionaires and share being  normal  human beings without superpowers  The show creators couldn't change that  Secondly, I do think this show started off a bit weak, with the Pilot moving too fast to get him into the hood and most of the cast a bit awkward with their roles, but as the first season progressed, it became increasingly good  They sorted out their pacing problems for the most part, and the characters by the end of the season had grown to be much more comfortable in their roles  They actually delivered powerful performances in the finale  Now, a LOT of people are unhappy with how this show fails at realism  To them I say, don't just see the first couple of episodes and judge  Yes, it does seem unlikely that Oliver Queen became a martial artist/expert archer/hacker/parkour expert by spending 5 years alone on an island  But the show does delve into his past a lot and gives reasonable explanations throughout  This is also my favorite part of the series, the flashbacks  These become increasingly interesting and mysterious and compliment the narrative wonderfully  On his 'mask' being ridiculous, it works for what they show  He is mostly in the shadows and/or hidden to be seen anyway and when he does fight, he moves fast enough to not be seen  Besides, they again have to stay true to the comic books and even so, all you can really see is his lower jaw, the same as Batman  Also, he still has more of a mask than Superman ever did  I also liked how the show used his bodyguard in the show  Diggle took up the mantle on a couple of occasions, giving Oliver the perfect alibi and completely disproving the assumption that he is the Arrow  This is something I have not seen any other superhero do really and I thought it was well done  The action in this show is also pretty good, considering it's a TV show  The one place it does fall through is the drama  It does get a bit excessive at times but one has to see that CW has to appeal to its main audience base; one that is used to the melodramatics  The actors, as previously stated, have really become comfortable with their characters  Stephen Amell in particular, has abandoned the slightly stoic persona and shows the naïve-ish Oliver queen versus the fright inducing vigilante quite well now  His portrayal of the old Oliver on the island and the contrast to the present Oliver is also well executed  Katie Cassidy does well in patches, she still does seem to be lacking but its not too bad  The rest of the cast is fine  People complaining about Thea have to understand that her character is supposed to be rebellious, considering what all she has gone through even if it is a cliché  One character I did not like was Helena  I feel like that was a casting error more than anything, but it was still disappointing  Overall, I think that this show is very good and it honestly surprised me a lot  It seems to be improving with every subsequent episode and I thoroughly recommend it  Please do not listen to the negative comments  ",8,0.5,8.5,"Positive"

"Arrow","2014-01-15"," This is one of those shows that took a moment to find its way  The show was iffy in the beginning, obviously knew it was going to be a darker more mature tone than smallville but a bit awkwardly written, and it shows in the opening title   my name is oliver queen  now i must save my city  people just don't speak like that  I'm also kind of mind blown as to how the CW thinks people treat billionaires, in real life there would be more people trying to ask him for handouts  Also, Olivers younger sister needs to polish her acting chops, maybe brush up her Adler method  By now, they've ironed out most of the kinks, namely the cheesy CW'esque predictable dialog  Anyway by season 2 most of the cast has it down and its getting exciting as they start throwing superpowers into the mix so oliver ends up more than just jason bourne with arrows  I'm at the edge of my seat for Ra's Al Ghul, who has been teased throughout the last 2 seasons and there's a lot of suspense with what they've shown you that they haven't shown you from on the island, particularly whether the entire 5 years were spent inside and what the assassins had to do with it  With the undertaking over, the eyes are on Moira to see what part she will play in the fallout of her actions  And blood    well i think he and the count have some catching up to do Overall this show has just gotten progressively better every episode so i've got high hopes for it the next few seasons  If it keeps on continuing like this, it may just end up in my top 10  It was a much better show than Revolution which came out at the same time, which i had higher hopes for  So far it is also a much better move for the CW than acquiring the tomorrow people, which has still not ironed out its cheesy CW-ness  Even with superpowers like telekinesis and teleportation, its not as cool as arrow because of the shallow repetitive dialog and idealized characters UPDATE: Late season two, i can officially say this show is a keeper  Deathstroke is absolutely the best villain yet, and while this show isn't my first priority television wise, its definitely got me interested in whats going to happen next  They've polished out the kinks and got a well rounded storyline, and the tension between the characters is at an all time high  I would say the production crew and writing staff has learned a few things along the way and gone from an awkwardly timed generic action show to making some of the most surprising, emotionally intense scenes i've seen on television  The stakes just keep getting higher, the odds keep getting slimmer, and Deathstroke even more powerful, its really coming into its own  It started as a show that was maybe a 7 or 8 but has progressively gotten better building to an absolutely fantastic second season  This is without a doubt the most improved show this year and they've come a long way since the pilot  ",10,0.5,10,"Positive"

Should I blame the  writers  for stealing or  borrowing  conceptual ideas almost everywhere? Take the Batman motive, put it in the Nikita framework, add some O C  Jibberjabber, shake it, put some great cherries from Lost on the top and voila - there is our new hit guarantee  Hell yeah, since we have some really huge and almost unbearably exciting  mysteries  about the background stories of the characters, why not shoot some scenes on a mystery island anyways  As there is no need to cover the  transfer of ideas , we might as well hammer it into the viewers head: This show is so cool and so hip, like all the Batman movies combined, but newer, AND it has Lost in it!Should I blame the producers for casting only model like hobby actors? Should I be irritated by frequently showing the topless Adonis, who is supposed to be the Green Arrow, while he is working out? Or should I wonder why fathers look the same age as their sons, of course extremely handsome and  ageless young ?I could go on like this for hours  Well, not for hours, as there isn't very much more to say about this show  Fact is, none of this really bothers me, I've seen it and learned to deal with it, as long as a show delivers what I asked for: Some respectable action and good entertainment  But this piece of something manages to ruin even that  There always have to be some pseudo-dramatic scenes, these more than poorly written and played soap elements finally stabbed me in the guts and took me down  I have to surrender: Please, no more arrows! Why do I have to live in a world where Firefly was canceled and Arrow will probably run for decades?The three stars are only for costumes, some pretty sweet combat scenes and Manu Bennett (who played Crixus in Spartacus, I just like this guy)  ",3,0.4,3.4,"Negative"

"Arrow","2013-11-08"," Let's take a moment of mourning for the TV plot arcs of yore  Back when shows prioritized the characterizations above the action and, if indeed there was action, it took place precisely in the last 7 minutes of the episode, and was all done with before the close, giving the characters a chance to make light comic banter, close down the storyline, and give the audience a chance to go to the toilet  How many TV shows followed that formula I cannot say, but the number was in the 100s  Now all that has changed  You can now have action many times in the body of a show, it is permitted, even encouraged  And you have action even before the characterizations are fully developed  All this is positive evolution I think  But here the catch  There are no more  closed  story-lines  In the multi-band, multi-channel, multi-device electronic age, where viewers tend to have attention span of a hummingbird, nighttime TV has astonishingly borrowed the Rule Book of daytime soap operas and, lo!, plots never actually resolve, they just become more complex  ARROW is one of the best exponents of the new type of comic-book-derived drama, arguably as good as or even better than SMALLVILLE (which was, thematically, all over the map)  Amell is great  He has a whispery kind of delivery which oddly makes what he says that much more interesting  The supporting cast is great  In fact the only thing that prevented me from giving this a  10  are the flashbacks  They are terrible  They are like some silent Hell the viewers must go through to get back to the actual episodes  It is almost as if the lead writer, as a small child, was locked in a closet with a DVD looping KUNG FU, and grew up to believe that you cannot advance 10 minutes of plot in the present, without 2 minutes of flashback to fortify it  ",8,0.4,8.4,"Positive"

"Arrow","2013-10-24"," After reading that this series was  trying to be gritty and dark like the Nolanverse Batman , based on my contempt for the Dark Knight Rises and gradual decreasing opinion of Dark Knight I decided to avoid this show completely     How wrong was I?I suppose the fact I have never read a Green Arrow comic may have helped  I always viewed the character as a very camp, poor man's Batman when he or Arsenal (who I did like) crossed paths with any of the Bat- family  This however is a slightly more dark and sinister Green Arrow who doesn't have a problem with killing people  There are elements which feel very similar to Batman Begins and since the first season is his first year as  the Hood  I think it was unavoidable since both character's have similar back stories  The pacing of the episodes is good, I got sucked into the story enough that I didn't spend half my time looking for flaws  The action/fight sequences are fast and well choreographed except for the pilot episode where you feel like he's an 80's action hero, (seriously, out in the open, surrounded by guys with automatic weapons, and none of them could hit the side of a Battleship if they tried? Come on!) As with all series there will be some rubbish episodes and bad casting choices, basically the ones with Helena Bertinelli aka  the Huntress were particularly poor and the choice in actress, well she just isn't sexy enough or athletic enough for the role so I just hope she doesn't come back It does not take itself too seriously and there are some humorous moments including a few DC in-jokes  It isn't perfect yet but it has the potential to be as long as it doesn't follow Smallville's strategy of - lets build the series to an ominous finale aaaand then give the fans a steaming pile of crap Finally I state this for all the 1 star reviewers who are clearly Nolan fan-boys (you watch the pilot and think you can have a valid opinion on an entire series? Suuuure!)  This is not a pretentious, pseudo-philosophical artsy show, it is entertainment pure and simple  So if you think DKR is the best film of all time just don't bother watching this show, you will find every reason to hate it, so just pop in your worn out DVD and watch it for the 400th time the rest of us don't really care what you think!

How do soap-opera heavy story lines of bickering families full of people with massive egoes, and very little acting talent, with the thinnest scraping of urban street fighting, make for such an enjoyable run of episodes?First off, the first three episodes are quite frankly terrible, and nearly destroy the entire concept  But, persevere, and you will be richly rewarded  From episode 4, things pick up considerably, until they reach a climax of perfection with The Huntress' two parter - episodes 7-8, and episodes 9 and 10 are consistently good  Then, the whole thing sort of goes off track again, with complication upon un-necessary complication, and the Robert Queen journal is put into mothball, as Oliver kind of forgets what he's supposed to be up to, and fights random, usually quite annoying criminals, like The Count, the absolute nadir of the show  The two part finale, whilst literally ripping off the exact plot of  Batman Begins , is suitably epic in scale, and delivers shock upon shock, and made me realise that I'd enjoyed this show more than any Marvel film  This, is the way forward, one of the few Nolan clones, which works As for the cast, Stephen Amell is someone you will grow to like, as he gets more comfortable in the role (He's definitely rather weak to start off with, in those crucial first three episodes), but most importantly, whilst not being a brilliant actor, he is a likable enough personality  The star of the show, in terms of acting, is David Ramsey, playing a half Dr Watson, half Alfred to Amell's vigilante  Ramsey is charismatic, and totally at ease in his role, easily the best actor in the show  Katie Cassidy playing Dinah Laurell Lance, is annoying, and prone to bouts of whinging, which get on your nerves, as does Willa Holland, Queen's younger sister, who at times, is the most annoying person in the show, hands down  Colin Donnell, playing Tommy Merlyn, Queen's best buddy, is another talentless effort, who stumbles through his lines like a robot  Susanna Thompson - pretty much the same, but less annoying  Paul Blackthorne, playing the unwashed police father to Laurell Lance, constantly poses, and doesn't have a genuine bone in his body  Cotton Haynes, as a juvenile delinquent version of Roy Harper, the same  Emily Bett Rickards, as convenient plot gap filler, Felicity Smoak, a computer nerd, is again all show, but mildly charming in a deeply irritating fashion The guest cast, thankfully, is better - John Barrowman is an excellent corporate main villain, and even Alex (River Song) Kingston shows up as Laurell's mother  For comic fans, you'll get the pleasure of seeing a brilliant rendition of Deathstroke, a less brilliant Deadshot, a pretty cool, but totally changed Royal Flush Gang, and Kelly Hu's China White  But as I said, the highlight is most definitely the Huntress - played with style and panache by Jessica De Gouw The series makes extensive use of flashbacks to Oliver's island ordeal, and a rather implausible storyline about hired mercenaries, in which Olly's going to learn to do his thing  More training, and less killing tons of guys in black balaclavas would be nice, but who can argue with Deathstroke, the most awesome thing in the whole show? Shame he's killed half way through  For series 2, I'd like more ideology, and symbolism in the island stuff, counteracting the action in the main narrative The story lines are generally very character driven, with around five minutes of arrow packing action an episode on average  Not much, but generally worth waiting for, because the fight scenes are well worked out, and generally exciting, in spite of their Dark Knight style editing  Acrobatics and parcourt are used extensively, to give a functional feel to Oliver's combat system The characterisation tends to suggest that all these characters are very narrow minded, as they continually over-react to the smallest things  A lot of ego-trips, posing about, and people coming out with things like  Stop Judging Me! , and  I'm not who you think I am , and  Why did you lie to me? , as well as just about the entire cast at some point telling Oliver that they wished he'd died on the island (including Olly himself in the last episode ) All rather tiresome, but there's some nice ideology in there too, as well as perhaps the closest match to an actual comic book feel I've ever seen for any superhero adaptation,with tons of dilemmas, and secret identity crises  To be honest, it feels a lot like seventies and eighties Spider Man comics  Not bad at all  So, overall, it's definitely a grower  Maybe they never call him Green Arrow - instead opting for the likes of  Hood Guy  (Yeah, THAT sounds cooler   ), but it's an earnest, and enjoyable show, even if it does fluctuate rather in terms of quality  Put it like this, I'm looking forwards to Season 2 considerably, and, whiny soap opera or not, it's got a lot more character in it than Marvel movies  Hopefully, Arrow will be the way forwards, carrying the Nolan torch into a dark urban world, and giving us a ray of hope  A work of art?

Oh yeah, then there's the premise of the billionaire kid who become a martial arts superhero in only 5 years, the IT girl who can  hack  FBI encryption in two keystrokes and the mindless dialog    Yes it's a  superhero  series, but to me it just feels horribly awkward and clunky  Somehow though, it's still watchable    ",4,-0.4,3.6,"Negative"
"Arrow","2013-09-17"," Just saw the first episode and after high expectations am somewhat disappointed Good things up front: Stephen Amnell is a pleasure to look at and his costume really is one of the cooler ones in the superhero world (no pointy ears, no tights, no cape to get stuck with in a revolving door)  And there is no awkward animal-reference in his hero-name! However, the story and the character seem kind of familiar  Young Millionaire comes home after having suffered  At home, he keeps playing the high society idiot, while in his secret fighter identity he tries to save  his city  from the bad guys with the help of his butler - sorry, driver  Oh, and his wannabe-girlfriend is a lawyer for the poor and helpless  Sounds familiar? You might say: Why not copying a good idea? OK - but this was not a good copy  In a series, you normally have more time to evolve a character, than in a 90-mins movie  However, this was just clad together without any love or effort  They gave Batman much more time in his movie to show his motivation, his background, to make the character 3D  My feeling in ARROW was:  you all know the general idea anyways, so let's tick of the main points so that we can get to the action   If you like that - It's your show Some more irritations: His father, after having been a  bad guy , turns around in a life-threatening situation (where normal people think about themselves, even more so a bad guy) and asks his son to set everything right - not really convincing  In Batman at least, Wayne tries to keep up the ideals of his father, which he grew up with - much more convincing ARROW pushes away his girlfriend, just when she seemed to mellow towards him  In Spiderman, they took a whole movie to motivate this act  Here - nothing (ah, you know, that's just what superheros do, so swallow it!) The bad guys here are the  Money Makers   OK, after the financial crisis, that was to be expected at some point  However - as opponents for a super-hero? I mean - to defeat simple bad guys (like the Cat, the Penguin, Dr  Octopus) with simple kick-ass action, that is OK  Nothing against simple solutions - but then create bad guys where that fits  The worlds economic and finance system is just too complicated for an  I kill them and then their're gone  solution  So the ARROW certainly satisfies the desire for vengeance, but not the desire for a good story Promising, however: the hint at the end, that his mother is up to something against him  Whether this motivates me enough to watch the second episode, I'm not sure yet  ",5,-0.3,4.7,"Negative"
"Arrow","2013-09-13"," I wonder if people on here have actually seen anything past the 10th episode, because this thing got off to a rocky start  It stumbled, fell, and almost died on its way to the ER, but somewhere, the acting started coming together  After being squelched and tweaked, most of the cast departed from the soap opera plague that infested it, early on Arrow borrows a little from Nolan, but does it well  Reminiscent of Bruce Wayne, Alfred Pennyworth, and Luscious Fox, Oliver provides raw emotion to the quest, Diggles his moral center, and Felicity, in a Freudian id, ego, superego tug-of-war, provides a pragmatic middle ground  Like the Dark Knight series, the name of the hero is very loosely associated with the depicted character   Green Arrow  is actually called  lame  in the single time it was mentioned  A huge departure from the Nolanesque is the character's willingness to kill those that stand in his way  He racks up quite a tally, and isn't really sorry about it The origin story is interspersed within the actual real-time story line, which reflects on the character  Oliver's transformation happens quickly in places, and shows that he is tougher than he appears, but the naivety on the island isn't as convincing as his hardened demeanor after his island trial-by-fire  That makes me believe that the island cut scenes were shot before the rest of the season, making it impossible for the cast to form the close working relationships that would naturally happen, later Villains are not superhuman, and their place is more of a conspiracy, rather than a target of revenge (Diggle's brother, aside)  Oliver's quest isn't about revenge, it's about going down a list, and checking names off as these names get offed  Some episodic deviations occur, and should be overlooked, as the overall story arc is actually pretty good Playing Oliver Queen, Stephen Amell is physically devoted to the roll  More than just a few of the stunts look like they were done by him, and nobody should doubt his dedication to the physical prowess of his character  For all of its weaknesses, Arrow takes enough from Nolan to make itself a solid base, and makes for a good TV adaptation  I give it an 8/10, but a rock solid 8/10, with room to move up Watch it through to the middle of the season, you might be surprised  ",8,0.1,8.1,"Positive"

"Arrow","2013-08-04"," I'm not a Green Arrow fan  I only know of him through the Justice League animated series and he'll occasionally appear in graphic novels such as the Dark Knight Returns Part 2, which is why I took an interest in this show To be honest, I really feel like this show has MUCH more potential  G A  was originally designed after Batman (millionaire, father dies, etc), but the structure feels more like Smallville but with a lesser known character  Rather than play on the witty gadgets that Green Arrow might use, the directors chose to play on focus on family drama, ie G A  is the overprotective brother, mother is with another man, his best friend sleeps with his girlfriend, etc  I also wish the show wouldn't make Detective Lance look like a complete moron  It would've been great if the makers of the show provided more perspective into the lives of other lesser characters such as John Diggle, Thea, Laurel, etc  G A  feels like a 2 dimensional character, yes he killed in the beginning, but after that he simply wants to bring justice to the city and every episode seems to end in the same way  There was hardly any villain that was equal to G A   Comparatively, Batman can be seen in many different angles  For instance, Batman could be seen as a man who NEEDS to be the caped crusader and subconsciously creates his own nemeses Lastly, the dialogue was overly cliché, which made a lot of the characters seem 2 dimensional ***SPOILER***I know I said lastly, but they freakin' killed Deadshot  No freakin' wayyyyyy!!!

But Arrow has despaired me in every possible ways  The 1st episode was interesting and it had started well  But throughout the whole season we have observed same old monotonous story lines, poor dialogs, dull acting and the hero wins it all things  The Character development was very poor  After watching the whole season i'm still not sure about the relationship of Oliver and Laurel  It appeared more bizarre when the previous day Olliver tries to make things normal between Tommy and Laurel and the next day he bangs her! A superhero needs to have some self respect!! The character of Thea Queen was also a disorganized one  A good storyline could diverse all other faults of this kind of TV serial  But unfortunately the plots were very predictable and it will make u bore  There were another storyline where we were shown how Oliver had become 'The Arrow  in an island and by which the directors had tried to give it a  Lost  flavor, but in vain  There is no ups and downs in the story  Its plain and simple and which is boring  In a word its very hard to keep the patience to watch all the episodes of the season  Stephen Amell has done well enough as oliver queen  He seemed pretty good in action scenes  But, in emotional ones sometimes he made me laugh!! I can remember at the season finale while he was holding Tommy's head and screaming in his name, I never felt any kind of sorrow but laughed by watching the poor performance of him  I liked to watch Kate Cassidy on the screen  She is both sexy and beautiful  The Character of Felicity Smoak was the only interesting character i guess  This character had some punch lines, humorous dialogs and the actress who did this role( I don't know her name) did well enough  Whatever, after watching the 1st season i can ensure you that, i'm not gonna waste my time for the next season and I'm not gonna recommend this to anybody  ",5,-0.1,4.9,"Negative"

Laurel's character is a bimbo who wants to save the world and expects to be fed the truth by everyone she has a relationship with  The audience of course wonders why anyone would be truthful to this girl if she simply is not about to handle the truth The saving grace of this entire waste of money comes in the form of David Ramsey who plays Diggle and Paul Blackthorne who plays Quentin Lance  Brilliant actors who do it well  If Stephen Amell did not have Davd Ramsey to bounce off a lot of scenes off, he'd be a dead fish floating on the river Nile for all one would care I could go on but in all fairness, the actors worked hard  I give em that  The fault really lies with the writing and direction  It's movie making at it's worst  The show is forgettable  Or maybe to be more accurate, this show will be remembered only because it is so bad I'm giving it two stars - one star for David Ramsey and one for Paul Blackthorne  ",2,-0.4,1.6,"Negative"

It gets way more interesting to see how he became the so called  Arrow  or  The Hood  if you will  But when you are watching Arrow have in mind that the manuscript is not meant to be realistic such as Dexter or white collar  It is more like a crazy hero kicking some bad guys asses! You should not watch the show based on the realism because it isn't logical  An example is the revenge vs  justice logic  Oliver want to see the bad guys in prison and will not kill for revenge but this isn't happening in some episodes  Another example is that Oliver don't want to hurt innocent but he kills all the bad guys bodyguards All in all it is a fantastic show to watch with lots of action!

"Arrow","2013-03-17"," Being more a DC than Marvel comics fan, I'm familiar with the (Green) Arrow character Oliver Queen, but, in the manner of Smallville, from the same production company, the links to the original character are fairly tenuous  This modern-day archer has the same social conscience, but is barely in his 20's, has a six-pack, can't seem to grow a beard and doesn't even use the Green Arrow moniker  Moreover, his social conscience takes the form of hunting down the corrupt former associates of his ruthless billionaire father, following a boat trip which goes wrong, claiming the life of his then girl-friend's sister with whom he's having a fling and after-ward his father too who brutally sacrifices himself and another survivor so that his golden boy son can later return to their dirty old town and clean it up Pauses for breath   ,that's a lot of back story and there's more as our hero tries to make it up with his former girlfriend now a firebrand crime-busting young attorney but who won't forgive him for going with her sister, plus her dad just happens to be the local chief commissioner who naturally hates his guts for losing his other daughter and did I mention his scheming mother and her new lover, together now in control of her late husband's business operation and his truculent younger sister with the giveaway nickname of Speedy (GA's  Robin -type sidekick in the comics) so that there are plenty of characters and plot strands to develop I'm only two episodes into the first series and what I can say without doubt is that this show is obviously targeted at a younger demographic than me  The Arrow character owes too much as a crusading spoilt rich boy to a certain resident of Gotham City (he's even got an  Alfred -type bodyguard watching his back) while the producers aren't above stealing a few riffs from the their rival publisher's Spider Man character (Laurel's dad is a cipher for J Jonah Jameson) so that one can easily see why Queen's character would never make it on the big screen That said, it's directed very much in the modern style, with fast cuts and dynamic action sequences although I'd like to know how our boy can shoot everyone with his arrows and not kill them, while the characterisations really are comic-book paper thin and the hero's Labours Of Hercules quest will I fear become too predictable The acting is serviceable with no one trying too hard probably because they don't have to but if I've nothing better to do i'll maybe occasionally dip in to watch this glossy but rather facile entertainment in the future  ",5,0.3,5.3,"Negative"
"Arrow","2013-03-14"," OK guys, this my first post, so bear with me for a moment and be patient  Most of the negativity toward this series comes from the beginning of the show  Later on, it gets more over the characters motivations and background  there's no black and withe pictured as blunt of most of the Super hero theme goes  If you go over the layers of superficial good looking actors and actresses or the wealth of the families to lure some of the superficial folks all over the world you could see a deep plot, well written and properly set during the show duration so far  All the troubles that the Arrow dude goes trough are easy to connect with if you are willing to  And his motivations and the island period are a very nice twist to the show  that said, I think it has lots of potential to success over the last Super hero TV shows we had in the past, some one remembers Smallville?

"Arrow","2013-02-21"," I've enjoyed DC for many years in all its mediums and the reprisal of the (Green) Arrow to the mainstream in Smallville was enjoyable despite the beautiful people aspect of the series  So I was expecting a lot from  The Arrow  especially when 2 of my favourite actors appeared in it, John Barrowman (Dr Who/Torchwood) and Manu Bennett (Spartacus)  I was thinking  YES!!! So I've stuck it out for 15 episodes  Even when the soap level side plots and lazy scripting and dialogue have threatened to derail some pretty good action scenes and the main plot line itself  The cast has quality in it  Susanna Thompson who is rock solid in her role  Colin Donnell does well as the troubled son trying to find his way in life  John Barrowman is toothily good in his role as the Arrow/Queen family's nemesis  So I won't blame the acting for the stuttering character development, as I know what this cast is capable of  You can almost see the actors gritting their teeth having to use heavy handed cliché dialogue  I would point to the direction as a big problem though  For instance Paul Blackthorne's portrayal of Lance (another solid actor) came across as a case of psychotic schizophrenia     Who am I he?  he cries   loving father or psychopathic cop that is quite happy to risk his only remaining daughter for a bust  To lose one would be careless to lose two? No wonder the poor guy is losing his hair  What can I say about Stephen Amell/Arrow, well he has an expressive suit(even though it is ill fitting especially for a billionaire)  More than I can say for Stephen's acting  To be fair he does look the part, still that can only take you so far  The original DC Green Arrow was a bit of a wit and had a turn of phrase which is something a more expressive lead may have brought to the show  While the suit could certainly be saved by a visit to the tailor it might take more to save Stephen from looking so constipated all the time  The product placement in almost every episode has not enamoured me to the show either  Treating the viewer as an unthinking consumer that will digest anything put in front of them is patronizing and insulting, more so when it is done so blatantly  Since when does a tracking device that can be monitored on the internet require you to switch from an alleged state of the art smart phone (Lumia) to a notepad(Surface), a device that we know fits in every gals purse when they are at a dinner dance wearing not much more than a smile Still 15 episodes in I'm still looking for it to become more than an extended advert for chewing gum  Will it get a second season? Probably but for all the wrong reasons  All this series needs is new writers,real direction and a miracle to raise it from mediocrity and sometimes outright embarrassment  Maybe it is time to start again I would ask one question of IMDb how does this show merit an 8 2 rating?

"Arrow","2013-02-17"," I can't believe the incredible polarity of the reviews for this show! I was a huge comic book fan when I was younger (quite a few years ago, I admit) and Green Arrow was one of my heroes  I am loving this adaptation! OK, it's not 'Game of Thrones' as far as production / writing / acting values go, but it is damned entertaining and takes you along for a fun ride  Come on, you knockers, it's a COMIC BOOK for goodness sakes! Stephen Amell is a good choice for the lead and I personally think he's a good actor (check out his creepy performance in  Justice for Natalee Holloway), maybe dealing with less-than-riveting scripts (yes I agree, some of the dialogue is cheesy - but I stand by my 'entertaining' comment)  Besides which, I applaud the priorities of the production crew, which have him bare his amazing physique at every opportunity (we women need a bit more eye candy!)  Couple of negatives - not enough of the wonderful Colin Salmon, and what's with the green eyeshadow instead of a mask? This must surely be a bit of a nuisance when he's doing a quick change and I know he conceals his face wherever possible, but as a disguise it's pretty ineffectual (though I suppose nothing is as bad as Clark Kent/Superman's hairstyle/glasses transformation - was Lois Lane blind as a bat, lol)?! I'm also getting the vibe that it is going to evolve into more of a soap opera if the story lines keep up their current trend, instead of concentrating on the action - but we'll reserve judgement on that one  If you haven't already, give this show a go - if you're not expecting Shakespeare or BBC classical drama and just want to be entertained, this could be just what you're looking for!

"Arrow","2013-02-07"," I noticed the featured user review gives the lowest possible rating for Arrow, claiming it to be horrible without having even watched a full episode  If it's not already obvious, please learn to ignore trolls with no sense of reason Like all good CW shows, Arrow builds with each new episode, becoming better, more engaging, more curious  There are a few filler episodes here and there, but unlike more conventional television, Arrow has two main stories that play out as the first season progresses  There is the present-day storyline, where we watch Queen do his vigilante thing, but we also get to see flashbacks to five years past, where, while stranded on an island inhabited by dangerous and mysterious hostiles, a younger Oliver is forged into a formidable warrior  There are mysteries being revealed in both present events as well as in the flashbacks, and at some point these mysteries will be explained, and possibly even intersect in some way  So far, this first season has weaved the narrative well, and created some fairly thick suspense that holds the viewers attention Arrow works well by grounding itself in reality  There are no meta-humans to be seen, only normal people who have honed their skills to achieve great things  There are relationships and character development at work here that make the show interesting to watch regardless of the action  Saying this, however, the action is still what Arrow does best  Fights are fast and brutal, and really well choreographed  It's not just how the fights play out either, but who the players are, and the heroes and villains seen in the first season are all worth watching for Give Arrow a try, maybe by watching an episode deeper into the first season  For a slow-burner, it's already burning with a fierce intensity, so we'll probably see it come into a league of its own by the end of this season  ",8,0.5,8.5,"Positive"

Have they updated his emotional responses yet?) and the drama between the family and friends overly long and tiresome  I still thought it had potential Much to my chagrin, the tiresome drama was quickly extended through each episode and the subplot and action downgraded accordingly  By the fourth episode, I was bored, I turned it off  I absolutely could not watch any further  I found that I didn't care at all about the feelings or relationships of the characters, and if the villain ever showed up (dont blink or you'll miss him) I was rooting for him to win  ",1,0.2,1.2,"Negative"

"Arrow","2013-01-04"," Not going to lie but I am a bit obsessed with this show, yet I'm not a fan of superhero based shows which is why I was hesitant at first about watching Arrow  After the first couple of episodes I couldn't stop watching, the drama, the plot, and the acting really drew me to the show  I would definitely recommend this to anyone, this is the type of show which should by on air more often  But I do have to say I still think they stretched out the show a bit too much meaning it took a bit longer for me to start really liking it then usually P S  Burned is the best episode   just saying :D ",10,0.2,10,"Positive"
"Arrow","2012-12-26"," I stopped watching this TV series only after 3 episodes! I did try my best What is the problem? Stephen Amell as Oliver Queen is the BIG problem, he is simply not credible, not plausible at all in the role of this main character Green Arrow! He simply does not click at all with me  Oh yes, he has muscles and so on but I simply do not connect at all with the actor and his character! He is so emotionless that it is really very bad and painful to watch him in his role! So bad is his character and the awful acting by Stephen Amell that I had to stop watching this TV series What's more? The stories with this TV series simply do not seem plausible at all either  That is probably a very big problem, for me at least! One of many examples? The scenes where the main character, with his bow and arrows, happens to unbelievably outclass someone with a gun!!!Actors matter and the way they act through their characters does matter a lot too  That is probably the lesson of this TV series  Muscles are not enough to make an actor good for a particular role requiring muscles and, more important, plausible, for this particular role For instance, the actor Justin Hartley who played in Smallville Oliver Queen (a k a  as Green Arrow), he managed in Smallville to make such an unbelievable character perfectly believable  It is certainly a big achievement compared to the pathetic performance Stephen Amell as Oliver Queen produces in this TV series Arrow  That is where you see how an appropriate actor for the role does matter a lot but also the elements introduced in the TV series to make this particular character of Green Arrow believable are also very important  For instance, all the high tech gadgetry related to arrows that Green Arrow in Smallville used made his character believable, as he could reasonably be seen as having an edge against other competitors with say guns for instance  In this TV series Arrow, there are basically no elements that are presented for this particular character to make him truly believable, truly plausible in any way Here are mostly TV series and a few movies that I highly recommend, as I watched them and enjoyed them a lot --------------------------------------------------------There are a few classics in science-fiction TV series:---Smallville---Star Trek: Enterprise---Babylon 5---Earth: Final Conflict---Battlestar Galactica---Star Wars (6 movies so far and counting)---Jupiter Ascending (a movie)all deserving 15 out of 10 because they are all very special TV series for the quality of their stories and for the amazing actors that they have  Are these TV series perfect? No, as they sometimes have  filler  episodes that are not too great and they also sometimes have  holes , illogical elements in the main story or in the individual stories of particular episodes  Despite sometimes the presence of these very few shortcomings, these TV series are really unique and special in many ways that you will nevertheless enjoy them greatly Other TV series that are excellent but not necessarily science-fiction? Here is my list of other excellent TV series that you will appreciate a lot:--A few more science-fiction:---Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome (it is science-fiction)---Caprica (it is science-fiction)---Babylon 5: Thirdspace (it is science-fiction)---Space: Above and Beyond (it is science-fiction)---Defying Gravity (it is science-fiction)---The Tomorrow People (it is science-fiction)---The 100 (it is science-fiction)---Almost Human (it is science-fiction)--Non-science fiction:---24---24: Live Another Day---Dexter---The Vampire Diaries (it is fantasy I could call it)---Breaking Bad---Kyle XY (it is slightly science-fiction)---Nikita---Damages-------------------------------------------------------- ",4,0.2,4.2,"Negative"

Its a disgrace for all the other great shows out there  By the way, I rated it 3 only because of Katie Cassidy Maybe its only my opinion but I will not watch it in the future  ",3,0,3,"Negative"

"Arrow","2012-11-10"," Firstly watching the pilot had seemed to much like Chrispoher Nolan's Batman Begins which was off putting as it was like a cheesy copy of Batman Begins  The hero coming home and avenging his city with no pacing and rushed, the love interest working at a law firm that helps the weak and has great morals (how typical   ) and the police being a big deal to the show but they have no character to them  All the characters have poor character introductions and development along with the cheesy acting from all the cast essentially the Green Arrow The theme of Arrow is very confusing with the drama and setting at times darkish and then lighter and also trying to add humour towards it (which is working, sorry)  The law firm and police station set seems like a daycare place for the kids and seriously  if you're trying to make it like the Nolan theme then sick to it and have gritty sets and better quality actors   Take a look at Vampire Diaries & Supernatual, they have a dark theme towards it and quality drama and acting which are also my favourite shows The good part (and perhaps only) is the fight scenes to them  If they had spent as much consideration to the story and character as they did to the fights, then Arrow could reach its potential  And perhaps it's better than there newly CW shows like the horrible Beauty and the Beast and Emily Owens m d  ",6,0.2,6.2,"Positive"

"Arrow","2012-11-09"," When I first saw the previews for this film, I was very excited for a darker, vigilante type show  Well, it isn't as dark and thought provoking as I would have liked, but that was just my own expectations  You will NOT like this show if you are one of those people who needs everything to be realistic; but, if you are someone who doesn't mind having your brain  look the other direction  every now and then for the sake of realism and slightly cheesy acting and plot lines, then there is a decent chance you will like the show a lot  It is basically a combination of Robin Hood and Batman; the story line so far has some pretty good promise and I look forward to watching more episodes  But again, it is a CW production, not a major motion picture production, as long as you can keep that in mind, I think you will enjoy it a lot Edit on 9/19/2014: This has actually turned out to be a fantastic show; one of the best on television  The characters are well developed and there are real consequences the good guys have to deal with; very good show!

"Arrow","2012-11-09"," Based on the DC comic book character Green Arrow, the show is an adventure/action series developed by Greg Berlanti, Marc Guggenheim and Andrew Kreisberg Billionaire playboy Oliver Queen (portrayed by the obscenely handsome Stephen Amell)returns home having spent the last five years stranded on an uncharted island to find his city in all manner of criminal disarray and wanton corruption  This will never do  And so, the once irresponsible lothario sets about on a campaign of righting the wrongs of the nefarious town that was once his playground, targeting the key miscreants that are responsible  Using a mixture of Parkour, practical martial arts and a exceptional talent for the bow and arrow - not to mention of course his limitless flow of disposable funds, he begins to target the shady figures he deems accountable and subjects them to some vigilante style justice This show is great! The story is fantastic, and the layers are deep and plentiful - from the ongoing flashback sequences detailing Olivers time spent as a castaway to the clandestine figures and the obligatory love interest with whom he must redeem himself  The production values are incredible, the show runs at a breakneck pace and boredom would only be a problem for those suffering from the most crippling form of ADHD  The action is superbly choreographed - as indeed are the fight scenes that are indicative of our desire to see a more believable style of on screen fisticuffs  The tone of the show is rather camp, but that's to be expected, as is the acting but not to the degree of overkill  The first episode left me very eager to see the next and so much is set up within the first show - without becoming convoluted, that I couldn't wait to see how it all pans out  Such good fun - lighthearted yet dark in places, this shows appeal will stretch far beyond that of a comic nerd demographic and thankfully has been picked up for a full season  ",8,0.2,8.2,"Positive"
"Arrow","2012-11-05"," Most of the reviews I see are based on just the pilot, or pilot and ep2 After ep2 things start to be more explained by short flashbacks I too wondered  How does surviving on an island make one good at teakwood?  So far, via the flashbacks it would seem he was trained by a scruffy Chinese who has been hiding from some black suited, masked, gun carrying men  Maybe smugglers? Terrorists? A fuller explanation will come in later episodes I'm sure  Although I have no idea how he would learn hacking without a computer, maybe he just buys his hacks My main complaints is just that the show wastes too much time on him fixing his sister and poking around nightclubs with his friend Pretty good but I would much rather have had a season3 of human target, it was much more creative in fights and felt more adventurous to me  ",7,0.4,7.4,"Positive"
"Arrow","2012-11-04","    this show is almost indescribably bad  It makes me angry just to think about Caveat: I don't know a whole lot about Green Arrow  His name is Oliver Queen, he gained his skills while marooned on an island, he's rich, and he is SO EASY to make fun of  But this isn't an attack on the concept  I've seen sillier concepts work out to be much better shows Arrow is one of those shows where wooden acting, poor directing, and writing about on par with the Twilight Saga come together to create one of the most offensive television experiences I have ever had  And I've seen Jersey Shore Stephen Amell as the titular hero Green Arrow and Katie Cassidy as Laurel are particularly bad, with approximately one-and-a-half facial expressions between them and a penchant for removing themselves from the room as the standard method of showing anger  You could make a drinking game out of it, truly The writing is staggeringly awful  However, when I say  writing,  I'm not speaking about the plot  That might yet unravel over time, but it's too early to tell  What I mean is the actual words which come out of people's mouths  There is a specific scene which comes to mind where Oliver and his best friend, Tommy, are seated at a table, discussing their friendship  Tommy reveals that he's been sleeping with Laurel, and Oliver's only reaction is,  That's okay, I forgive you   I closed my eyes for this scene and realized that I could not even tell who was saying what at certain points  They have no verbal mannerisms, and the  funny  best friend has no real sense of humor that I could discern  Plus, his jokes plain suck, but I guess that's a minor point, all things considered  I should point out that, recently, a friend told me that Tommy Merlyn turns into Green Arrow's nemesis, which means they of course have a lot in common and might seem like the same person at times  But that doesn't really come across as purposeful on this show The directing is maybe the worst offender, here, because a good director could turn cruddy actors and poor writing into something downright entertaining  Just look at Sam Raimi's work on Spider-man 1 and 2  Instead, I find myself imagining David Barrett or John Dahl or any number of the other directors on this show, sitting there texting while scenes are happening  Maybe eating a sandwich or something  Not paying attention must be hungry work I'm getting into a lot of detail, so I'm just going to cut this off and say that I should have seen it coming  Just look at the promo picture  Really consider it  That was the very first thing we were shown regarding this series  Ask yourself what that says about their priorities  ",1,0,1,"Negative"

"Arrow","2012-11-01"," Disappointing  I'm very surprised people rated this so highly  Very mediocre plot line for the pilot as far as  super-hero  stories go  Being stranded on an island somehow forges you into the ultimate fighting machine??? What did he have to fight on this deserted island?? I mite understand that he MITE become a good bowman   but that's leaning on the reasoning that he could build his own bow in the first place   and how in the world does that grant him extraordinary hand to hand combat skills? Was he training in judo with wild animals??? None of this makes sense and really it just left me a very hallow feeling for the main character  Good back story but the huge hole in how he became a super hero leaves me feeling very bland about the entire show  I think most super-hero fans will agree that HOW you become the super-hero is one of the most important parts of the story-line  This just feels like a very sad attempt at originality in my opinion  I'd be very sad to see a show like this get taken up for a second season when shows like The Cape got canceled before they even finished the first season  As far as the acting goes   it was just fine  Not a lot of room for depth in the main character so I can't praise the actor too much yet but I'll keep watching to see if it gets any better  There is NOTHING original about this show   I'm so confused about all this nonsense about this  cutting edge view  on a hero TV show  ",6,0,6,"Negative"
"Arrow","2012-11-01"," I'll be honest: I love the show  The show has a dark edge to it, which makes it very appealing  The plot is unbelievably well written, and it has enough humor for the occasional laugh  So, why do I say that I'm dissatisfied?I'd like to say that I'm a comic book reader  In case you weren't aware of it, this show is based on the DC comic book series, Green Arrow  I hardly read any DC comic books, so I can't say I'm very familiar with it  However, I watched Justice League when I was a child and Green Arrow happened to be my favorite  So when I got to hear that it was being developed into a dark show for the adult audience, I was thrilled  I had high expectations from it, which it didn't math completely Firstly, the acting is often melodramatic  Cheesy, melodramatic acting is such an annoyance  Its shown mostly by the main female characters, i e  Laurel, Oliver's Mom and Thea  Secondly, its plain dumb at times  The show puts on melodrama that is somewhat transparent, but shouldn't be put on anyway  How can Oliver such a strong grip on technology? He was abandoned on an island in the Pacific, not in New York of the 28th century  Oliver swinging through Starling City on a rope attached to an arrow shot from a bow? That would look totally awesome with Spider-Man (Seriously, think about it  Spider- Man with a red bow in his back and a red arrow in his hand  Sweet ) but not with Green Arrow  Even if he is at the peak of human capability, that is impossible and they should have acknowledged that  If these flaws weren't so distinctive, I wouldn't have hesitated in giving a show a 9/10  I hope that the nuisances that I pointed out will be fixed, if not in this season then in the next  ",7,0.1,7.1,"Positive"

I would put this series right in the ranks of TV series likes of Game of thrones, Walking Dead & Dexter etc  The script writer has skill fully kept many things hidden and open and releasing them slowly and makes the audience hungry for more  Bottomline is, see a couple of episodes  If you have ever liked any super hero movie/comic/cartoon in the past, chances are you will cling to this series very strongly  ",10,0.5,10,"Positive"

It;s nice that he has his father list with people that he wants to hunt and i like the connection between him, his girlfriend and the girlfriend's father (both working under law)  I also like that he is not the person who was before going on that island but acts as he is the same guy  It's a bit strange that after 5 years on the island he knows everything about computers and software but i am sure the next episodes will present also this explanation  ",10,0.6,10,"Positive"
"Arrow","2012-10-24"," As for who I am, I started reading/collecting comics in the early 80's, my collection growing both forward and backward, and spending most of my adolescence hanging out at the local shop  With most of the characters that have seen either screen lately having 50-75 years of history behind them, I've learned to separate the  fanboy  and the viewer in me to avoid picking apart every detail, so i can enjoy the TV show/movie for what it is This wasn't really necessary here, as Green Arrow isn't a very far-fetched character, and more grounded in reality  Plus, they've remained true to his origin, although at time of writing, only two episodes have aired (I never judge a series by the pilot) After CW's success with Smallville, I was fairly certain they'd have another DC comics series in the works; and when I found out it was (Green) Arrow, I was happy, but slightly disappointed Justin Hartley wouldn't be reprising the role (mostly because he'd become the face associated with it) But once I saw the previews, I knew  pretty boy  Hartley had no business being on the show since they were going with the darker, grittier aspect of the character  Unlike other superheroes, Green Arrow isn't driven by a need for vengeance, or a moral compass; but more of a (sometimes border-line self-abusive) obsession with vindicating himself for continual shortcomings or mistakes in both of his identities, be they real, or simply a matter of his own perception With action scenes that re-enforce the fact he's not just a sniper with a bow, but also showcase Green Arrow's stealth, agility, and hand-to-hand expertise (as well as a few quick winks to the comic book fans already) I'm hoping the series stays around for a while, but the ratings will decide if  Arrow  has enough  green  to go  ",8,0.2,8.2,"Positive"
"Arrow","2012-10-24"," I'll be honest, as soon as I heard about this show, especially how about it would be  dark and gritty , I felt I wouldn't like it  However, two friend of mine recommended it, so I watched the first episode I'm giving it three out of ten because the cameraman had the camera turned on and pointed in the right direction during filming, the scenes located in a castle were actually filmed in a castle, the costume department had provided some costumes and the actors weren't actually reading from scripts during the scenes  But everything else? Waste of time I know that the biographies of Green Arrow and Batman share some similarities, but this simply lifts a good portion of the plot of batman begins, re names a few characters and places and packages it up in 42 minute installments No-one in the cast stands out, they've gone to the same pool of TV/ soap opera actors you've seen in half a dozen shows already  They're generic looking actors (for example, the actor playing  arrow , I can only imagine the casting call described him as  Christian Bale/ Chris O Donnell but cheaper ), which wouldn't be so bad if the script gave them any chance to shine, but it doesn't - it's just thoroughly mediocre  At one point someone says the line  I guess starling city has a new guardian angel , always be wary when a writer has a character say this, it mean they're not sure they've managed to convey that through the plot, which is sort of the point of the plot Speaking of the actor, Stepehn Amell, I guess he watched the dark knight trilogy, and decided that portraying a multi faceted character with layers to his personality, who's hiding a dark and sinister nature mainly involves scowling a lot  there's a reason Christian Bale is paid a lot of money to scowl in movies; he knows how to do it well  This guy? not so much Long story short, if you liked  Smallville  maybe you'll enjoy this  But for all it's pretension for being a dark and gritty adult drama, this is aimed squarely at angsty teens who'll buy iPhones because they see them in this show  If you want to watch an engaging character based drama about a DC comics superhero, watch Batman: The Animated Series from the nineties, because honestly, the animated characters in that seem more human ",3,-0.2,2.8,"Negative"

Lets hope enough of us watch it to make it profitable enough to keep on the air Likes:1  Over all look and feel of the picture  ( does it help I like green? )  2  It's not too slow building up characters  They don't try to feed you a huge background story to explain the character to everyone  You get a little here, a little there  And not too slow too where it seems they edited out a scene that would explain it better ( like Prometheus   )  3  The actors sell their roles  Not all are equally good but good enough for great entertainment  Dislikes:1  I would have expected a certain character to be already dead   but a little variation from the comic is working so far  2  Ever see UHF with Weird Al where he makes fun of Rambo? He is 4 feet away from an enemy with an automatic weapon firing constantly yet he misses every time   then when Rambo (Al) shoots back they explode  Ya   it wasn't that bad but I think it's a little far fetched at times (it is TV   but too far fetched)  ",10,0.4,10,"Positive"

It is Arrow is the new CW show about comic book hero and fan favourite Green Arrow  After being shipwrecked, Oliver 'Ollie' Queen decides to train himself and become a better person  In the comics, he decides to fight off various villains  In this show   he decides to become a murderer Yes, I found it quite hard to identify or sympathize with this character  Unlike Batman, this 'hero' flat-out kills his enemies, most of whom have so far been bodyguards or unscrupulous businessmen, and has stated he has a hit-list of corrupt people he wants to take out Further similarities are created with his love interest, a snubbed woman with a vague job that apparently involves helping people, much like Rachel Dawes of the Christopher Nolan Batman movies  So far, both characters feel the same - items for the hero to attain and defend The editing throughout this pilot was terrible  By inter-splicing the backstory, a coherent feel could've been attained - however, this was not the case  Random moments of him in a lifeboat every 10 minutes leave you confused, especially since it hasn't been explained how he's attained his skills  The action is well-directed, but overtly violent  In an attempt to distance itself from the fantasy of comic books, this show went into dangerously dark territory and it lost me The character of Oliver is confusing at best - the distinction between his playboy lifestyle and his inner turmoil is blurred, giving him the feel of an angry teenager who wants to lash out at the world  The other characters are stereotypical at best - his serious, black bodyguard; his womanizing, sex-obsessed friend; and his sister who is angry and rebellious, but clearly spoiled rotten The show does have a few pluses - Green Arrow's costume is extremely sleek and well- designed, the stunts are well-done, and the set pieces are well-done However, similarities between its influence ruin this show  The show feels more like a darker rehash of the Dark Knight trilogy than its own project - and, in this, is where it ultimately fails I will continue to watch this show, in hopes that it gets better - to make your own opinion, you should as well  It's worth a watch, at least  ",5,-0.6,4.4,"Negative"

"Constantine","2017-04-30"," 'Constantine' brilliantly combines spell casting, occult, and humour  John Constantine is one of the most flawed & damaged characters ever  He has a painful and depressing past, and walks the Earth knowing he's going straight to hell when he dies  Yet, he still finds the courage to battle evil, crack a joke, and support the side that rejected him  Through all of the emotional turmoil he must go through, he still manages to live his life as an exorcist, a gruesome, terrifying, and extremely high pressure line of work  John's daily experiences would drive an average person insane with haunting memories  John has no superpowers, he just is an expert at dark rituals, and wages war against demons  The show balances John's humour, pain, and also has quite a few very frightening scenes that accurately capture what life as an exorcist might be like  John Constantine, despite his past, is the kind of man who is brave enough to scam the Devil, blackmail God, and still make you laugh  He could walk to hell and back unshaken  He's been face to face with demons, and he's been face to face with angels  This show ranges from dark voodoo rituals, to white robed angels with long flowing red hair and beautiful white feathered wings  Overall, the show is very intense, often scary, sometimes uplifting, and will have you on the edge of your seat  I would really love it if a channel picked this show up again, Constantine deserves a season 2  If you ask me it deserves more seasons than any other DC television series 9 4/10 ",9,-0.7,8.3,"Positive"

The first 5 episodes were also kinda slow but after that it does pick up really good  I was also surprised by how much blood there's in this show i mean it's pretty hardcore at times and it totally has a very different feeling than Arrow, Supergirl, Flash, Legends of Tomorrow and even Vixen and i enjoyed that but i have to point out that at times there's some stupid jump scares that really bugged me  But overall  Constantine  is a great show that for sure it's not perfect but it totally deserved a Season 2 and i'm gonna give it an 9/10  ",9,0.3,9.3,"Positive"

"Constantine","2015-08-07"," I was always into DC/Vertigo comic books, because they contained a really dark element  John Constantine is my favourite anti-hero  He is so cool and bad ass  I think that Matt Ryan was the most suitable actor for this role and portrayed John Constantine a lot better than Keanu Reeves in the 2005 homonymous film  The show shouldn't have been cancelled  It was extremely underrated  It is one of the best comic book adaptations I have ever seen  A lot of the story lines in the comic books are used in the series (slightly changed of course), as well as characters such as Zed and Chas  The opening theme of the series was a masterpiece  It summed up the atmosphere of the show  You could say that I am not objective since I have said that I love the Hellblazer comic book series  So I am going to stick to my points giving specific examples and analyzing my statements Acting/Characters: I would like to start by analyzing the character of the notorious exorcist, demonoligist and master of dark arts John Constantine  He is a man forced to live every single day carrying the burden of his decisions, the people he hurt and the souls he doomed to hell along with his  He has a good soul really, but is not trustworthy  He is literally the only person standing between us and hell  He has made his choice: He is going to save mankind no matter the cost  Well, quite the hero right? Hmmm, not really  It is actually the people he is trying to save most likely to pay the prize of his impulsive actions  He has good intentions, but, in order to attain his often misunderstood goals, he hurts people and becomes manipulated by the dark forces he is trying to beat  He has also plenty of inner demons to fight and, to be honest, he is better at fighting those from the underworld  He is a complex character and Matt Ryan is cut out for this role  Zed is one of my favourite female characters in comics  A phychic artist that was instantly attracted to John  There is a deeper relationship between them, both mental and physical  In the series only the former is portrayed  I don't think this affects the whole connection between them and it is possible that if the show hadn't been cancelled, we would have seen it  Zed has secrets that we didn't have time to explore in the series, but in the comic books are pretty socking  Anyway, I can say that from all the comic book adaptations on TV in the year of 2014, Constantine was certainly the most accurate one which enlarged its fan base, but had a different storyline that enabled it to unfold in a whole new way  I was surprised and excited that it turned out better than I ever expected Hellblazer Revived: The 2005 Constantine movie with Keanu Reeves was treated with mixed views, mostly bad  I am usually not influenced by people's opinions and I always form mine, but in this case I couldn't agree more  I liked the concept of the movie, which was inspired by one of the comic book story lines, but I was kind of disappointed with the portrayal of the main character, John Consantine  I am not saying that Keanu Reeves' performance was bad, but he was not really the ideal candidate  I think he is really charming with his persona and I enjoyed his acting in the Matrix, but he doesn't have this    I can't name it but Hellblazer's fans will surely understand  First of all, John Constantine is an English man and it is emphasized throughout he comic books  With his trench coat, his bloody cigarettes and his manners with other  mates , and his radical ideas about the Queen and society  he reflects a representative specimen of the English population  Matt Ryan is Welsh (close enough)  However, the years have changed and some topics that were covered in the comic books are omitted (racism and sexuality), but this is quite understandable because we are not in England and this is not the 80's  ",10,0.4,10,"Positive"

Perhaps its the rather predictable story lines? Or maybe its something about the cast?For me its the last of these, the cast, that really holds this series back  There's a noticeable lack of chemistry between cast members which is exacerbated by Constantine's rather clichéd and grating British  matey, matey, ello Guv  routine  The result is tiresome characters you really don't invest that much in  As a consequence when they are threatened, you really are not that interested in what happens to them, robbing the series of the tension and pace it desperately needs  On the upside, (yes there is one) the series does offer a few scares and some novel villains  Its not utterly dreadful but, in my opinion, more considered casting and character development would have made this series more enjoyable  Five out of ten from me  ",5,-0.3,4.7,"Negative"

"Constantine","2015-01-31"," DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT WATCHED THE SHOW!1: So Constantine checks himself into an asylum and has electro-shock therapy to get rid of his memories, almost like lobotomy  IF this is the case, why does he remember everything as though the electro-shock therapy never happened? If it does not work on him because of who he is, wouldn't he have known that it wouldn't work (since it hints that he's been doing this to himself for a while now)? It was almost like he wanted to be electrocuted in the brain   but he just didn't want to say it directly 2: What's with the constant brooding? Gosh, even Batman smiles more than this guy 3: The lady in the asylum, which he saves, writes on the wall Liv Die  We assume Liv is a person or a thing  Yet, somehow, Constantine instantly knows that Liv refers to a girl on the other side of the planet who works in a small town electronics store  Really? Wow, I didn't realize that there was only one person on the planet named or nicknamed 'Liv'  4: What made the ground open up and almost swallow said Liv? There was nothing inside - it's almost like the ground imploded into a big circle of flame, and then suddenly Constantine rocks up with Frankenstein and saves her after speaking to some Angel (I assume it was an Angel)  5: Back to point 4, does she not freak out that a huge hole tried to swallow her? She just runs off and goes back home and to bed? Wow, this lady must've seen some crazy stuff growing up 6: This has several pain points    a) Why is there an Eye of Horus carved on her door? No explanation, just  Oh, that's the Eye of Horus carved on your door     b) Did it even explain the salt-line on her door? Did she not notice it when she stepped out and back into her room/apartment? c) Who called the cops about her dead friend? She lives RIGHT NEXT TO HER and didn't hear her die, didn't hear the screams/sirens/cops until AFTER they are taking the body away? And then   what   she just goes back inside her room and goes to sleep again? d) Why would a demon possess her body AFTER it is locked in a bag and driven in a truck? Why not simply possess her while she's alive, and then go to Liv's house and kill her? Seems like this demon is dumb as doggy poop  e) If the demons can 'sense' Liv, it would've known that she wouldn't be at work  So why would the demon drive the truck into her desk? She was miles away - halfway across the country it seemed  7: The Demon Seal Constantine paints is not very effective, is it?! Firstly, the demon sees it (again, dumb as doggy poop), and secondly it does not do anything to make them powerless  Also, how did Constantine surround the demons in a circle of flames? If the paint was flammable, why wouldn't the entire thing (not just the outer rim) catch on fire?8: She can see 'other dimensions' with the amulet thing her father used  That's fine in itself  But she does not really see anything unless she concentrates  Okay, a stretch but I'm patient  Then she sees her grandma when she's questioning her mother  Fine, let's go with that  But then   she can't see anything weird again until Constantine holds the amulet with her - then she instantly sees EVERYTHING! Why? Because Constantine has the ability to   no he does not   he does not have anything like her ability  Okay, again   WHY? Is she SUDDENLY and INSTANTLY in a state of total and utter concentration when he grabs her amulet that she is able to see everything about the other dimension? (And, on another note, how come all the 'ghosts' she can see are all HOT?)9:  I'm Constantine   Okay, I accept that name even though I've never met you, just saw something freaky but am fine with it, and jumpy but, for some reason, don't have any problem with a British guy following me   I knew your father     That's not possible because he died decades ago   But it's true   Okay, I believe you - now I'll go interrogate my mother, who immediately tells me she lied when, for the last 20-something years she never told me   presumably because I never asked   You can see things others can't   Yep, makes sense to me  Where is your dungeon with weird, creepy artifacts and old books with ancient spells and whatnot? Oh, right there  (Seriously   even the Winchester boys find it difficult to convince the people they have saved that they saved them from something supernatural )10: I know that some people have made parallels with Castiel (Supernatural) and Constantine of DC Comics fame, and perhaps Castiel's character is loosely based on Constantine  But that does not mean if you make a show that is actually about Constantine you make him dress the EXACT SAME WAY! What, are they running low on wardrobe budgets in TV Shows? At least give him a different colored trench-coat, even if it means going slightly away from the comics  And the brooding   my goodness   can you get more self-indulgent?! This guy walks around with a face that screams,  IT'S ALL MY FAULT   EVERYTHING IS MY FAULT   I WISH I WAS DEAD  and talks as though everyone should instantly believe him no matter how crazy he sounds (luckily, however, Liv seems to believe every word he says and is immediately willing to give up everything about her current existence to follow him - how fortunate for them both?)

So back to the part where she met a creepy guy after that and another creepy guy who she saw in her building (which in real life is a murder suspect) but she doesn't tell the cops about them and trusts whats said in a fortune cookie? Oooooooook I'm done  3  And the last part that at which point I had to stop watching because my intelligence was offended  You see they were in a taxi cab which was hit by a truck and then the next scene you see all doors are closed, Constantine is magically outside the car and the girl is asking for help because    the doors are shut, sooooo he can teleport? 4  Lets take a moment of silence for the Stupid Demon  So a demon misses with the girls car, and electricity all around, he even killed her  friend  but he wasn't able to kill her at the beginning because she was running?

I am not from Liverpool but I know live close to the city and I love the accent  Also Constantine mentions that he spent time as a child in the mines in Liverpool  There ain't no mines in Liverpool  Corporates    I despair of your meddling in the creative process  However, if this is the doing of the writers then you should be ashamed of yourselves  ",5,0.2,5.2,"Negative"

Its is a good thing that the team actually make some changes to make it way more interesting  So please do not restrict yourselves to that plot you have read before, Constantine is an amazing show with numerous possibilities for future episodes The psychological turmoil in Constantine himself as well as in his friends around him is awesome  I am kept guessing on what really happen in New Castle and i am hoping we see a conclusion at the end of this season(: The stark contrast of Zed's personality just highlights how much pain and guilt Constantine is in all the time even if he puts on a brave front  In fact, Zed's actions help me see how vulnerable Constantine is now (as seen at the end of the episode)  i believe that Zed's gonna impact him in some way down the road  Constantine has his flaws, no doubt, being cocky and kinda don't really know who he is but hey it it only the first few episodes, you cant expect a character to be perfect right from the start  With Constantine being introduced to the audience as a combination of _______ and ______ (fill in the blanks yourself), it actually sets up the setting for the character development - I look forward to that (:The effects and creatures were awesome! So far Constantine has seen different kinds of demons, spirits and creatures already from different origins  It makes the show very very interesting and i keep wanting more after every episode  The unpredictability of what is going to happen next and what Constantine needs to go through to help safe people is never a mundane task I absolutely love this show and I hope those who watches it accepts this show for what it is and not keep wanting the exact reincarnation of the story line (:(note:I am not pointing out any particular people here, it is just general comments i have read and heard on social media) ",9,0.6,9.6,"Positive"

Where's his laser pistol? He could have easily shot Vandal several times in the back, made sure he was dead, and sneak back to a changed future  Nope, he doesn't do that  Anyway, somehow Rip overpowers Vandal, and has his knife at Vandal's throat, but he hesitates  Again, why? Rip knows very well that Vandal murders his family in the future  Rip also knows very well the destruction that Vandal brings onto the world throughout history  Yet Rip hesitates killing him  Of course Vandal's guards arrive and Rip loses his chance at revenge At this point the entire show breached absurdity for me and went well beyond stupidity, all within the first three episodes  Awful show  ",1,-1.8,1,"Negative"

"Legends of Tomorrow","2017-08-17"," I think the common misconception when being introduced to another CW/arrow universe show (as I was guilty of the same) is that the story will be fleshed out early on since we already know most of these characters  The first couple episodes are unfortunately evoking of this theme as well  But, given time to summon its own, standalone storyline, Legends eventually rivals and even surpasses the other C-dub shows  Without giving spoilers, I can honestly say the time travel gets much better, even more so than the beloved Dr  Who, as we all know how BBC uses ten year-old technology in order to save a dime here and there  The places they travel to are made to come alive with elaborate sets and great wardrobe attire  The characters become more memorable and we even begin to care about several of them once it is expressed that killing someone off is not out of bounds  The show is lighthearted at times, and there hasn't been many cheesy romance arcs akin to Arrow, which is saturated in them  Some of the characters are quite hilarious; while the comical genius of the writers is not anything extraordinary, the acting ability of the great Victor Garber combined with our all-time favorite con men Wentworth Miller and Dominic Purcell left my side splitting on many occasions  To reiterate the theme of this review, the show takes some time to grow on you  The leading man turn of Arthur Darvill (who, by the way, is one of several crossover actors from the Doctor universe, ironically) is not as spectacular as the show needed it to be, but this is of no fault of himself- he simply doesn't have the space captain gravitas of a Patrick Stewart  Like the show, however, he does grow on you and I found myself considering him one of my most beloved characters before season one concluded  Here's hoping season 3 continues to up the ante in terms of Legends finding its groove and continuing to improve  ",9,0.5,9.5,"Positive"

"Legends of Tomorrow","2017-07-07"," I genuinely think that DC's Legends of Tomorrow is underrated  It is a step in the right direction for CW's television universe  The show as a whole brings under-used characters from The Flash and Arrow and gives them a chance to be focused on and developed  The story line in the two seasons can be somewhat confusing, but when made sense of, is very enjoyable and gripping  My personal favourite character is Sara Lance, as she is a strong, a natural born leader and a great captain of the wave rider  She brings order, discipline and a sense of hope to the Legends  I personally believe that Rip Hunter should have played a bigger and more effective role in season 2  Besides all of the positives, there are a couple of negative features that I would like to point out  Some of the acting seems quite stale, as I think that some of the newer members of the cast don't have enough chemistry between themselves  Also, there are minor issues with the CGI used, especially when in the Wave Rider  I personally don't take too much notice of this, but it does sometimes bug me  Besides the few minor criticisms, the program as a whole is great fun to watch and has a story line which will make you want to come back to watch more  ",9,0.4,9.4,"Positive"
"Legends of Tomorrow","2017-06-19"," Let's be open about  Legends of Tomorrow : Of course the stories are rubbish, and the acting is (with some exceptions) nowhere near Marvel Netflix quality  But this series has something that Arrow (which tries to be incredibly gritty) and Flash (which tries to be incredibly witty) fail to display: Entertainment value! Legends of Tomorrow is like the playground of the Berlantiverse where you can take underused characters or crazy story ideas and make an episode out of it no matter what happened the week before  This is even more so in the second season where the constant need to antagonize Vandal Savage has gone The writers can send their heroes straight through the ages from feudal Japan to the Wild West, from the 80s to the future  There is an overall storyline but that is not what makes this series fun: What makes it fun is the snappy banter of Snart and Rory, the crazy jumping through time trying to save the timeline while having no qualms causing time paradoxes themselves (constantly!) and not giving a damn about making sense  Doesn't sound like a modern TV show? Well that's because it sounds like a classic comic book, existing just to be enjoyed and to have people have fun with it Yes, the bogus stories and the crappy acting may turn many people off  But I'll take Legends of Tomorrow over any season of Arrow with its abysmal flashback story lines (and its own crappy acting) anytime  ",7,0.3,7.3,"Positive"
"Legends of Tomorrow","2017-06-06"," The overall story-line could have been outstanding, unfortunately there are several VERY powerful flaws that detract from the show unlike what was seen in The Green Arrow or The Flash adaptions 1st there is the major flaw which can be found in the shows premises 'time travel'  This would be great, however    it is time travel through the eyes of ignorant liberals; most of the time periods are either greatly exaggerated to the extent that you either you assume that 'that's REALLY how it was   ' or you ask yourself 'THAT'S really how it was!?'  From the racist, sexist and homophobic 50s to the vile evil of fascist Nazism in the 1940s The sad truth is not only will these ideas constantly bombard the audience as they watch the show however, it will also dumb them down with several dozen historical inaccuracies  My favorite of which are Eistein 'inventing the atomic bomb'(correction his wife invented it, truthfully Julius Robert Oppenheimer had more to do with the invention of the atomic bomb than Eistein, who immediately left the project after realizing what its goals were) and men being nothing but sexist pigs in the 1940s (truthfully during these periods men were more or less 'off cuff' when it came to women, however sexual misconduct was still regarded VERY negatively during this time frame and even though women didn't have as many rights as men at the time, men still had a LOT more manners than would be seen going forward into the 1960s-1980s)  The best of all though, was the overblown and historically inaccurate conception of the 'Nazis' utilizing idiotic premises like 'Super Nazi'(Like most media, the Nazi's or should i say Germans during WWII are CONSTANTLY portrayed as a inferior force or joke often seen as that 'mustache twirling, top hat wearing, twisted smiling villain, who is tying a women to a set of railroad tracks', oh and apparently their only purpose is for some cocky American dude to punch them out    if you really look at history, MOST of the grunts who fought for Hitler did so out of fear(for their families mostly), not subservient idealism and no opposition force in our history has ever been seen as darkly  even their allies, the Japanese got a better pardon from the US than the Germans did    But hey they did give us anime, video games and edible raw fish)  In fact the depiction of the Japanese was even more ridiculous due to their use of 'mixed English' in the entire episode and cultural intolerance Now apart from the terrible history lesson, there are three other HUGE road blocks that get in the way of this show   1) Narrow-Minded Social/Cultural Intolerance; yeah pretty much the show is watered down by it, everything from woman empowerment through male oppression to pro-gay anti-religious sentiment, if you like watching people frick with other people for their beliefs or exaggerate the truth through embellishment then this show must be pretty awesome for ya lol 2)Pro-Gay Propaganda; So    Vixon is no longer 'bi-curious' she is a full blown homosexual, a point which this show will bring up several dozen times a season (almost annoyingly so   )  There is no character that 'randomly' hooks up more than vixen which makes her look not only like a piece of eye candy, but also a total 'skeeze'  As many would find that a bit offensive due to her being a woman expressing sexual liberalism, all she is really doing is solidifying the role that women play as 'sex objects' in society    the worst part is that Vixon is ALSO constantly pushed as a 'role-model' for young women and packaged as a 'strong, confident woman' where she falls flat coming off more like a well    you know 3)Racial Intolerance; although the show features a decently diverse cast    not  Truthfully the show showcases one black male character and two black females (two of which is the results of cultural diversification in comics    (the black firestorm and now a black hawk-girl))  Unfortunately, the black male character seems to ONLY like WHITE chicks    a stereotypical portrayal that dates back to the racially charged times in the good old days  Also sad to say the character is nothing but a running 'look what these crazy white folks are doing now' joke; constantly being thrown into ridiculous situations that 'the white people' got him into Frankly its these faults that make this show only entertaining to the truly 'braindead' and how it got a second season I will never know  The only thing close to its level of arrogance is 'Team America and The World Police'  ",3,-0.7,2.3,"Negative"

"Legends of Tomorrow","2017-04-17"," I have just finished the second season of legends of tomorrow and after a bit of a disappointing first season this season improves on it in every way pretty much every way  The premise of the season sees the team scattered across time as with some new help look to stop a group of super villains from capturing an artefact called the spear of destiny  caity lotz reprises her role as Sara lance and she really becomes the main character and captain of the team and I thought she did a really good job  Her character has to deal with some emotional moments due to previous events and it truly does hit when it is meant to  Dominic Purcell as mick Rory is given a larger role this season and similar to Sara he has a hard time dealing with something that happened last season and I found him the funniest and one of the most interesting characters on this show  The returning cast of ray, martin, Jefferson and rip are all still good characters  The new heroes are Nate Haywood/steel and amaya/vixen, I liked both of these characters  At first I thought Nate was a bit over the top and cheesy but he grew on me as the season progresses  Now to the villains, reprising his role from the flash matt letscher is eobard thawne/reverse flash and he is great  He totally sells the role and I have always loved his character and I feel like he was the perfect villain for this season  Also I find Neal McDonough as Damien darkh incredibly entertaining and I really liked watching him  My only negative might be that I feel like John barrowman as Malcolm merlyn is entertaining but ultimately underutilised towards the end of the season  The story of the show moves across more interesting time periods and I just found the characters story arcs more interesting especially as the show progresses  I will say that if you haven't watched all of arrow and the flash then you will be lost especially when it comes to the villains as there motivations are linked to the other shows but for fans it really does work  The script of this show has some decent dramatic qualities that work better then last season and the humour is better, it just does come across as really cheesy at times which does hurt the show  The style of the show has some pretty good action scenes especially when it embraces its more sci fi routes  But this season similar to the first does have episodes that feel like filler for sure  Overall this is one of the best improvements to a series that I have seen and I recommend this season especially if you are a fan of the other shows in this universe  ",8,1.2,9.2,"Positive"

"Legends of Tomorrow","2017-04-15"," I don't know   I was expecting more, but it didn't hit home at all for me 1  Sara Lance - Her character is all over the place  They made her a captain to make the hard decisions, when in reality all the decisions made were either ad-hoc or by reasonable deduction  Sara was always a solo mindset  I don't see how going from the League of Assassins qualifies you to run a ship that jumps time-lines effectively  That role should have gone to another crew member  You never see her strength as a leader  There were actually times Amaya had much better leader abilities than Sara  And Sara seemed bent on making out with every woman she came across no matter what time period they were in  Sloppy touch  Her actions alone could have compromised several missions  Not the signs of a true leader at all 2  Dr  Stein - Far too many times they make him seem indecisive  I found that hard to watch when in Season 1 he was relied upon heavily to help Jackson get acclimated to his new role and powers   only for now in Season 2 he always struggles within himself  3  Jeffrey Jackson - I have no complaints with his role in the LOT other than he overdoes it   and a lot! They write his character abrasive in many shows, then they soften him up, then they give him credit for making the hard call   it's dysfunctional at best  4  Ray Palmer - of all the LOT'ers,I like him the most  He should have been the leader IMO  He ran a huge company back in Star City, had incentive to correct the time-line the most, but they totally watered down his influence on the show to fit in Sara being captain  Ray has a bit of it all, smarts, decision-making, knowledge, camaraderie, if anyone was fit to gel a team, it was Ray  Missed opportunity for the former Superman to have a lead again   lol5  Mick Rory - Mick has to be the best character of all  He is true to himself, he had THEE best character development of them ALL! You understood his position going back to making him Chronos, getting back to the team, having struggles with Snart, leaving and coming back  Mick was my hero the entire show and his character was the beefiest, most developed of them all IMO 6  Nate Haywood - He actually was a refreshing addition to LOT  He came in with a solid story-line that was maintained the entire season 2  He hit all his marks in terms of his love of history, his grandfather, wanting to address a past he wasn't happy about, but the journey helped him figure out what was more important   and that's all you can expect for guy who inherits superpowers but exudes a real heart  His character was worth the watch 7  Amaya Jiwe - SO underused! This girl's character was a frickin powder keg ready to explode! But every time you'd think they'd write in for her to be a badass? They hand it over to  of course, Sara   and Amaya proved she could make much better decisions than Sara along the way  That was very irritating to watch  I like how the love interest between her and Nate was developed  It would have been nice if she had a chance to actually MEET her granddaughter since everyone else saw their past or future in some manner or another   but oh well  8  Gideon - I think it was wrong for them to materialize Gideon and give her a smack-a-roo session with Rip IMO, but it was nice to see Amy appear on the show  The ONLY 2 things I don't like about how they have Gideon in the show is:1  The way Gideon talks - a little loud and hard to the ear (sometimes I'd have to turn my system down Gideon was so loud, but that was purposed by the producers) and 2  overly-human responses to the team throughout the show kills the tech portion of it 9  Rip Hunter - I liked Rip Hunter's character and wished they had more of him as his old self  But to have him under the influence of the Legion of Doom shouldn't have been as long as it was IMO  And they always found a way to make characters rationalize being on the bad side   it's kind of funny because it's so predictable in film now it gets boring  Though a snooze factor, I enjoyed him throughout Season 2, if not one of the most watchable of all the characters  I do, however, hate how they ended the show  Rip only talks to Sara as he leaves the ship  This is what you do for the most pivotal character of the show? He started with a bang, but end his character with a wimp? Not cool at all  The emotional attachment to Gideon alone deserved a much different ending!10  Legion of Doom - These guys were awesome  End of story  But, the way the story-line flowed was a bit irritating, and that's on the writers, not the actors themselves  But this lineup is a powerhouse and it's hard to watch really good actors playing bad guys go against really bad actors as good guys   well, not all of LOT, but   Other than that, I think I want to watch Season 1 again to remind me why I like this show because I almost stopped watching it once Sara became captain  ",5,0,5,"Negative"

"Legends of Tomorrow","2017-03-11"," It's not at all good  But, yeah, I'm still watching it because I'm a sucker for time travel stories  Part of it stems from being an historian, and part of it stems from heavily influential childhood sci-fi shows and      so long as they keep leaping from life to life, striving to put right what once went wrong and hoping each leap will   Yeah, yeah, yeah  It's time travel and good or bad I'm going to be in its audience just because of that This is why I want the return of the message boards  I mean, how else am I going to find out if Wentworth Miller is obscenely over-acting or if that annoying delivery is just how he talks in real life? I certainly don't care enough to explore it much further than this Did they get sued by the creators of Dr  Who because of Arthur Darvill's depiction of Rip? It seems almost too Dr  Who not have a lawsuit over it Dominic Purcell, the mystery returns, is he really over-acting that much or is his delivery just as naturally annoying as Miller's? Brandon Routh   really dude, you look a little too much like you belong in  Sliders  but that's not your fault Caity Lotz is really the only one here that is believably in the Arrowverse  She doesn't seem like a cartoon villain and she doesn't seem like she's ripped out of the pages of another series I know, I know   Ciara Renée   and again she would have been great in Sliders   but not so much here There is a lot wrong with it but   Time travel   going to keep watching it anyway and overlook all the over-acting and the bits and pieces blatantly ripped out of Classic sci-fi  ",3,-0.2,2.8,"Negative"

Who thought that this was a good idea? With the Flash now being one of the worst things on TV, and albeit a good try to rejuvenate Arrow that show too is (still) really bad, I believe that DC should keep to cartoons where they are great and close down these shows which are only embarrassing Do not watch, and if you do; watch the first episode of the first season, then jump directly to the 2nd season, or you can lobotomize yourself first with a rusty nail which may bring some enjoyment  ",2,-0.1,1.9,"Negative"

"Legends of Tomorrow","2016-09-25"," Just watched the pilot and it did not kick ass or make me want to see episode 2 immediately  Filming and CGI was OK for a series, though with only little effort it would have looked even better  The Waverider ship design looks terrible, the surface textures seem to come from a ten years old pc game  Costumes are OK to badly done, Atoms armor being the best of all  The writing is simple and neither smart nor very entertaining  I have no idea whether the plot is based on comics (I assume it is), nevertheless it can't be a jewel of comics art writing  The names are awful (Rip Hunter, Vandal Who?), the character design and looks are from the stone age  The dialogues follow the same route - a lot of blah blah (the evil super dork even talks to his foot soldiers about his plans, oh my) So actually nothing in this show seems to be non-cliché, which is quite boring  Studios and producers don't have the balls to make a show from comics like DV8  All they dare to do is gulp up the next offspring of already running and successful shows that can be shown at 18 00 and don't offend anyone Too tame, too botched, too flat Edit: OK, I did it and watched episodes 2-4  At least I tried, I had to fast forward a lot to omit terrible lengthy dialogue leading nowhere  This series is awful and so badly done that it's actually an insult  I vote down to 1 star now This is just the tip of the iceberg but here are some major flaws from episode 4 (no spoiler intended):- The bad guys flees into the Soviet Union, the team has no clue where exactly he is hiding in that oh so tiny empire made up from some of the largest countries in the entire world - yet the captain orders the ship to take course into the UDSSR and then suddenly without explanation it's Moscow, what else   The ship falls at a rate of 1000m per second and can still make a flat crash landing without anyone aboard getting injured  We clearly see the ship is not moving vertically when it cuts the engines  That means it's initial velocity is 0  It is shown to fall for about 4-5 seconds only from a height of 5000m, which means it would reach a final speed of about 50m/s ignoring the fact that the air friction and the non-aerodynamical form of the object would slow it even further down  Crashing into the ground with several hundred tons of mass at a speed of let's say 30-40m/s would still not be healthy to ship and crew  But - funny - when they reach the surface the engines are on and the ship is flying horizontally at great speed and still crash landing  We see the ship can easily spiral straight into the sky several times at ease, only this time it can't counter th terrible acceleration of 30 m/s to stabilize it's flight? This is big BS in your face Rip Hunter is the most annoying character I have seen in years  Whatever nonsense he utters it always makes him look like a total idiot  He is a Time Master  How did such an immature, unstable and short-sighted man ever become a Time Master?The glowing handguns that make the wearer a big target while sneaking through the dark forest    and they look like what they are: cheap plastic toy guns  And they have zero reach, too  Yet Snort and his  I always have this sinister expression  friend fire at ranges where they clearly can not hit anything  Doesn't stop them from trying and taking bullets from AK47s as a reward Using an audio mixpanel as controls for a pseudo-scientific installation  One that houses a massive radioactive source in a chamber with glass windows  The chamber could at least have been filled with water, but no And every episode a lot of talk, talk, talk  Nonsense  Insulting  Miserable It got nominated for the Best TV Comic Adapation - this industry is so dumb and rotten  ",1,-1,1,"Negative"

"Legends of Tomorrow","2016-06-16"," Season one dealt with Rip Hunter, the time master, trying to eliminate Vandal Savage, who murdered Rip's wife and son I think this story line went on too long, but the writers wisely gave it a conclusion in the season finale Now for the characters, it is just hard to like the Hunter character, though they tried to make him sympathetic  The Kendra and Carter characters just slowed the story and were somewhat silly  Their departure was a good thing at the end The Atom is very likable and reminds you of Christopher Reeves  Also, Professor Stein is good  Snart and Mick also are good characters, too bad the writers killed Snart, bad move About Jefferson, the writers need to develop his personality  At this point, it's almost a generic one Though I am not enthusiastic about season one, I think the second one will be worth checking out  Sometimes a series does not hit its stride until later  ",5,0,5,"Negative"

Well, not here buddy  Captain Cold and Heatwave apparently got some magical guns that shoot fire and ice that just kinda shove people around  I mean, it's a level of suspended belief that I just can't go to This show emphasizes best the flaws of otherwise goods shows like Arrow and The Flash have combined  Pointless pathetic drama, over-enthusiastic camera work, nonsensical plots One thing it has going for it are already fleshed out and familiar characters combined with some good actors  Dynamics of the group is A-OK  That and you have to admire a little at least about what they're trying to do on TV  It's ambitious at least But then comes the plot, oh the plot  Paper thin plot that when you think about it even a little makes no damn sense and it's a mess from beginning to the end  Rip wants to do this and that, everybody says he can't, but the rules of time are whatever you want them to be, but they are actually not, or are they    and so on  For a Time Master, he should know a little bit better how time works and give at least some basic rules and not change them every damn time the plot writes itself into a corner  Which happens in almost every episode For a TV show that has time travel as one of the main plot points, Legends of Tomorrow really don't know how to use that and have fun with it  At least some semblance of logic and structure of the show would be nice  But as of now, plots and subplots and main themes almost always contradict themselves over some basic logic  That's probably best illustrated through Rip's plan which is    well it's a mess and I even don't know where to start  He wants to save his family and wants to kill Savage, but he can't, so they travel through time to do some convoluted things just because?!

They just do stuff and stuff just happens, there's no reason, no stakes, no depth  One other thing that drives me crazy, and it came from Arrow but on steroids, is overenthusiastic masturbatory camera work  Camera never stops, never  It always moves, pans doing some impossible shots  In process ruining fights, great dramatic scenes and makes everything look cheaper as well  Just chillax camera dude  Still shots and simple but smart moving shots can sometimes work wonders, we don't have to pan in through every warehouse dressed up as hangar/lair/abandoned warehouse/industrial plant/factory/sci-fi big room/core/place where they fight/etc  Leave the camera crane and dolly out sometimes, please  Because of it, fights look massively choreographed, devoid of any  punch  in them  Maybe season two will get better or maybe it'll get cancelled, who knows  As it stands now, this show needs some more direction and way tighter and coherent plot UPDATE SEASON 2: mostly the same mess as S1, some things got better - story arcs, characters, some worse - fire and ice still don't work like they should, plot writing itself into corner  And then there's the final episode of the season that is just infuriating - even in  Previously on Legends  part in this same episode they say something like  We can change time with a timeship, but not reality from the spear    And then they do just that, change reality with a timeship  WTF FFS FOLLOW YOUR OWN RULES, SHOW!

The safe house with the young time masters also interesting, as was I surprised as child Rip Hunter (Michael) kills the Pilgrim  Woo    the hunters sent by the Time Masters before Pilgrim is a group of totally freaks  Atom is better than in Arrow season 3, he seems to be kind, brave, smart and cooperative  Firstly, I though he is related somehow Vandal Savage secretly, just thought what a great turn it is  Look: Well, Ray succeeds where Vandal not  If he already know about time travel, or he is just a little smart, he might travel back to tell past Vandal about his errors  He is however a psycho, so I do not know  Felicity is wrong, even her small cameo! Kendra is fair    however, I do not know about this relationship with Carter  I mean, it is destined to choose him always? Why? Because he is brave, has a fine jaw or sensible in a cliché level? Bring him back is disaster, he should remained dead, without him Kendra may kill Vandal with the mace or they just repeat the traveling to Egypt, where Vandal is an adolescent  But what if Vandal cloned himself? Many-many possible subplot  Carter - You have to remained to dead, for the betterment of the story, sorry  Snart - Most shrewd member, his theft jokes is always make me smile  However, he is compassionate, brave and selfless, he even show grace against Mick  Mick - The most interesting one, he is a dumb, aggressive enforcer by first sight  But he is a pyromaniac, low-cunning and headstrong man, his life as Kronos grows his cunning and will, he resist the torture second time, he is however wants to seem as a carefree and tough man, when he speaks with Ray at episode 15  I feel his rage unjust, when he talked with his younger self  (Violence makes you strong big cliché? Hope not   ) Sara Lance - Brave woman, and he is a desire to kill, but Kendra and Rip(if I well remember) helped her to calm down  She had a terrible past, Arrow seasons show it  Snart helps her to overthrow her killer attitude, they later crush on each other, as I saw  Firestorm - Professor is awesome, he is went through a considerable personality advance, as he became bolder and nicer  In the beginning he is arrogant, bossy and smart-ass, however he learns to listen Jackson, who is helpful, loyal, shrewd and heroic  Summary: I hope season 2 is better  ",9,0.6,9.6,"Positive"

Now I have to dislike you  The plot itself is ass  Rip Hunter gathers a team to find and kill Vandal Savage by attacking him at different points in time  But it's like, who cares? You can accept it because it's so confident in its insanity and so insistent on constantly shoving money at the screen to distract us, and for the most part, it works  The first few episodes are tough to stomach because the writing is SO gratingly awful from the get-go, but once the characters develop more and gain some semblance of chemistry (between some of them at least, namely Snart and Sara) and when they experiment with different time periods, that's where the show starts to get fun  The Wild West episode is entertaining, as are the ones where they explore the '50s and the racism and sexism that come with it  And the characters do grow on you  Snart was carrying the first few episodes but now it's more balanced  It's difficult juggling so many main characters and the show suffers for it, but the fun comes from watching these misfits interact in their absurd surroundings, making for some fun character building moments and the occasional comic relief  I actually don't hate Sara anymore, and Mick does his best Batman impression which makes for some hilarious moments, intentional or otherwise As it stands,  Legends of Tomorrow  has a lot of potential  Clearly the special effects budget is satisfied - the action sequences are fun to watch - but the writing needs to come together if this is going to continue as a series longterm  If nothing else, it's better than  Arrow  this season (though that's not saying much)  If you're a fan of the other DC shows or a sci-fi nut in general, you might get some popcorn-level entertainment from  Legends of Tomorrow   ",6,-0.5,5.5,"Negative"
"Legends of Tomorrow","2016-04-23"," Here we go again! Why is it that most TV writers, when doing a show based 100% on the idea of time travel, totally ignore the implications of the paradox they create? In this show we have a man hell bent on going back in time to kill the person responsible for killing his wife and son; of course, he also wants to  save the world , but that's just icing on the cake for him  That is the total reason why he defies the Time Masters, steals a time ship and assembles a crew for the mission Now lets say he is ultimately successful and kills this guy  Now his wife and son no longer get murdered  Wait! If his wife and son are not murdered, he no longer has a reason to defy the Time Masters, steal a time ship and assemble a crew for the mission! So it never happens! This is the most basic paradox there is for any story based on time travel  It's the same as the Grandfather Paradox  It you were to go back in time and kill your grandfather when he was a young man, before your father is born, you would never be born and thus could not go back in time to murder your grandfather! Good time travel stories get around this paradox by proposing the idea of creating alternate timelines  But such a theory has not been done here Too bad! ",4,-0.5,3.5,"Negative"

This is after the  heroes  who had previously just abducted newborn baby versions of themselves from their parents (they literally take one of them from their fathers arms right after they were born leaving the heroes mother bleeding in the backseat of their car)  Which sounds horribly non heroic to me  Why not capture the villain who is trying to kill all of the cast when they were young, when they saved themselves earlier? Atom hits the villain with a blast and then just leaves  WHY NOT CAPTURE HER THEN? Then later they complain that they cant find where she is and they are all in danger  It makes me wanna slap the writers  At first I thought it was cause they were  heroes  and didn't want to kill the villain  But at least try to capture her to protect yourselves  Its like Rip told them all before the mission, to only save themselves and let the problem with the time travelling villain to escalate for no reason  But no they put them in a safe house which changes the future so that their loved ones no longer recognize them, but then kill the villain anyways  Breaking the laws of time, and maybe directly changing themselves and their pasts to the point where they most likely wont have gotten aboard the time ship in the first place after leading completely different lives   There are numerous times when the heroes could have ended the show by removing the immortal villain Vandal Savage, but choose to run away instead  I mean he is literally knocked out and Kendra the only one who can end him forever is nearby with the knife needed to save everyone just leaves for no reason  (She was hurt at the time but just carry her over to him and end him   ) ** Spoiler end**While the special effects are good, the writing of the show is so mind blowingly horrible it is not worth admission  Its like watching a horrible horror movie where the victims randomly drop useful weapons and walk around alone for no reason, after so many stupid decisions, it makes you want them to die for their stupidity  The only reason this show has not gotten a 1 rating for me is the decent special effects  In my opinion, this show should be put out of its mercy and the writers should never work in Hollywood again  ",2,-0.6,1.4,"Negative"

"Legends of Tomorrow","2016-03-11"," The idea of scooping up a number of fringe heroes and villains into one in-fighting unit might work in comic-land but certainly doesn't seem to on the TV screen  Here we get a motley selection of characters from DC's two hit series  The Flash  and  Arrow , pressed into action to chase down time-travelling super-villain Vandal Savage under the aegis of their self-appointed, very British team-leader Rip Hunter I'm not aware of this show being based on any original magazine in the DC universe, making this a new-for-TV premise and I have to say it looks and plays awkwardly  Arthur Darvill steals some clothes from another time traveller with whom he's previously shared a police box and adds the most pukka English accent he can find  As for his assorted companions, they seem too many and too disparate  I get that they're mostly in pairs, Hawkman and Hawkgirl, ex-cons Captain Cold and Heat Wave and of course the two-for-the-price-of-one Firestorm making me think that Ray Atom Palmer and Sara Canary might yet get together  For me, they all of them just don't really gel, lines apparently distributed to each just to give them something to say rather than delineating character I must say, I'm also finding the endless deaths of the hawk-pair are starting to bore too and still haven't quite worked out what makes Vandal Savage so omnipotent and a match for all of them  The SFX aren't doing it for me either especially those involving Hawkman, Hawkgirl and The Atom  The idea of chasing Savage through time is of course unoriginal but could work if used imaginatively and humorously enough but this might take time (no pun intended) to fully develop Whether the programme finds an audience and gets retained for another series will be interesting to see  Personally, I'm not optimistic and really much prefer the characters where they were before  Maybe it'll get deeper and darker as it goes but just now I'm not really sure it's going anywhere but into TV oblivion  ",3,-0.1,2.9,"Negative"

So far he seems to be in the way and an annoyance more than anything  His clichéd storyline of avenging the deaths of his wife and son (ugh) already bored me to tears  With so many good and unpredictable shows around (e g Shades of Blue), you CANNOT be this boring and clichéd - The two (now one) winged people -- again these were the most dreary actors acting the dreariest of parts  They were so depressing, neither one looked like they wanted to be there  They were made tolerable in The Flash despite their individual awfulness, I think the writers on Flash really deserves praise for that - Captain Cold and Heatwave -- the two best actors on the show made up some of the least horrible scenes that were at least mildly entertaining, but barely scratched their acting skills  Why waren't they used more?? - Canary -- not used nearly enough, again a talent that is wasted by poor writing- Firestorm duo -- again, they were great in the Flash  But somehow on this show, they just don't pop  Even scenes that are supposed to be touching or meaningful end up flat or are spoiled by the pace of the show - The Atom -- he was good in Arrow and the Flash buit in legends of Tomorrow, this poor guy comes across as a very flat 2-dimensional character  He's used mostly for (weak) jokes and laughs In short, after watching and giving up on Legends of Tomorrow, I have a newfound appreciation for the shows that are actually GOOD and the writers that produce those awesome shows  ",1,-0.2,1,"Negative"

You're two crazy dudes  Get over it  I find it impossible to relate to any of these characters because they have no personality, they just look like people who watched one too many Steven Seagal movie by the way they walk and talk  Or, it's possible that my expectations were way too high due to the (misleading?) 7 5 stars on IMDb  I don't get it  Can't help but imagine a roomful of guys in a DC-owned building just giving fake ratings  I would recommend Jessica Jones and Daredevil  Or just watching your nails grow  ",3,-0.7,2.3,"Negative"

"Legends of Tomorrow","2016-02-18"," Here's the thing about Legends of Tomorrow: if you've been watching Arrow and The Flash and Supergirl right along, then you already know the level of writing and style of acting that you're going to meet in Legends of Tomorrow  Let's be honest, it's not the best writing in the world and the acting is (I think rather purposely) over-the-top  In that sense it's actually rather true to the comics, where there is a great deal of declaring  I will defeat you!  before clashing weapons  If you are looking for superhero-realism, go watch something Marvel  The DC televised universe has steered clear of realism ever since Barry Allen walked onto the set of Arrow  If you can't stand to watch the other DC shows, then don't bother watching this one as it is set in the exact same tone and style If, however, you can enjoy the comic-book style fun of The Flash and Supergirl, and you've been sitting around wondering where the heck Snart and Ray Palmer and Prof  Stein have gone off to, then Legends of Tomorrow is for you! It's a bumpy start, and after the pilot episode I'm still wondering why exactly Captain Cold and Heatwave are bothering to hang around, but then Supergirl had a rough start too and she's managed to pull things together enjoyably The biggest adjustment: Arthur Darvill (aka Rory Williams) is now playing a rather Doctor-like character, Rip Hunter  A man from the future, he stole a time machine against the orders of the Time Masters, and is now traveling around with a band of misfits trying to save the world  Insert skeptical face here  A quick visit to Wikipedia reveals that Rip Hunter is a character that's been around since the '70's in various incarnations, and that the writers handpicked the choicest details, scrambled them together, and have now invented for our pleasure a new version of the character (nothing new there)  If the character is examined it's not really the Doctor at all  A little less staggering intelligence, a little more bad-assery, and a deep seeded need for vengeance that drives everything he does, and the character of Rip looks less and less like the Doctor  It'll be interesting to see how he develops, along with all these other characters The most correct comparison for LoT would be to the Justice League, but as everyone is determined to compare it to Marvel then the best comparison is Agents of Shield meets Guardians of the Galaxy; A ragged team of misfits that don't really know what they're doing yet in a very mission-based, weekly plot  It's not the best thing to hit television, but it's far from the worst  And like all CW shows, it's not the plot that brings me back each week but the characters  Concern and curiosity for them will allow me to give this show a chance  And if you take my advice, you'll give it a chance too  ",7,-0.2,6.8,"Positive"
"Legends of Tomorrow","2016-02-17"," This show is a stain upon an otherwise unremarkable universe  It is a weak attempt to preempt Marvel's 'The Defenders' in creating a team-based superhero TV series, but fails miserably from the very start  What stands out is the mediocrity of the cast, the horrendous acting, the nonsensical and inconsistent premise (at the pilot, that must be a record!), and the motivation for the entire show literally being  forbidden love gone 'I told you so'  with time shenanigans Rip Hunter is a time-traveler who had a very brief mention as the inventor of the 'time bubble' in 'The Flash'  He wields a laser revolver  It is seriously designed to look like a revolver, with a cylinder having blue light where the bullet chambers would normally be  He is the sole reason the team exist, and his motivation is boring, unoriginal, and lacking  For a character with the ability to travel through time, he always seems to be in a hurry  His ship is called the 'Waverider', which is a reference to another DC character (who is not, in fact, a time traveling spaceship)  The series starts with him pleading to his employers to let him save the world, with a more than obvious conclusion the series expects to be a major reveal at the end of the pilot  It's not The team-selection process reveals strong self-awareness, as the primary reason for why Rip selects this team is quite literally  no one cares about you guys and you will have no significant impact on the DC extended universe   I wish I was making this up, but this is what goes for creative writing nowadays  Now, we not only have a show with mediocre characters played by mediocre actors in a mediocre story, we're also told from the very get go that these characters are insignificant and a bunch of losers The first recruit is Atom, a guy with a special suit allowing him to shrink (and fly and shoot lasers because screw comics)  The original comic version has a belt giving him powers, but nowadays full-body power suits with horrendous rotating parts (really, designer?) are popular  Character looks like a firefighter in midlife crisis with the power of technobabble and being insignificant in more ways than just being small Next up is Firestorm, an otherwise interesting character made uninteresting due to his generic origin and exposition in 'The Flash'  The main theme for Firestorm seems to be to make sure he rarely gets the opportunity to 'combine' in order to cut costs on CGI  Two combat encounters in the pilot alone had the professor and the mechanic kid split up, giving the reason  we don't need your blast-y powers , which stands for  our budget is only sufficient to have you on screen for no more than a couple seconds  Keeping with the theme of low budget, the White Canary is a misrepresented rehash of her 2010 comic version, where the character starred in 6 issues before being put to an early grave  She is a cheap replacement for the Black Canary who had the good sense of not participating in this abortion of a show  Thus, color-inverted canary was designed around the very concept of cheap, giving her a white jumpsuit and two iron bars  Couldn't afford a mask, though Then we have the bird-couple: Hawkgirl and Hawkman  Their sole reason for being in the show is because their original arch-nemesis, Hath-Set, has been unapologetically merged with Vandal Savage in DC's worst mistake so far  Their gimmick is that they are the only ones capable of killing Savage  Their acting is atrocious, but the studio probably couldn't convince or afford competent actors to play mace-wielding birds Lastly, Captain Cold and Heatwave  They ran out of characters to take from 'Arrow' and 'The Flash', even after the human rights violation resulting in White Canary  My guess is that their actors (doesn't that term require the ability to act, though?) have excellent managers and now DC can't get rid of them The big bad guy is Vandal Savage  In light of 'Arrow' and 'The Flash', it surprises me that the big bad isn't a direct copy of the Legends team, perhaps with inverted colors  Then again, Black Canary already exists  However, anything would have been better than to completely and utterly ruin the magnificent character of Vandal Savage  I weep for you, Vandal To illustrate how bad this show is, here are a few highlights:1  Professor Firestorm drugs the mechanic kid, whom he is intricately linked with, to irreversibly get him to do his bidding  All is forgiven  2  To show off female empowerment, there is a bar fight scene initiated by a fat crook who wants to rape Canary  It is even worse than it sounds  3  The black market the team sneaks into is, quite literally, a market  At some point they start to auction off a nuke, but bids are placed by firing a gun at the ceiling  4  Cold and Heatwave are so edgy, they constantly have to remind the viewer that they are criminals and only want to help the team save the world so they can be better criminals  Every time Snart opens his mouth, another dimension to his character manages to escape  ",1,-1,1,"Negative"

I know everyone will survive, kill Savage and happy ending  That's a joke  If a clear reason why nobody is being killed like they have extreme superpowers, all of them should be dead by now  Exactly the same as Arrow, the first season was good, it was all very logical and everything happened for a reason but then it got stupid, they run towards so many soldiers who are all shooting guns but nobody even gets shot, Arrow somehow beats Slade, who is and exceptional fighter and has Mira Kiru, he beats Ras Al Ghul, who was a better fighter, and no doubt in some stupid way, he will beat Damien Darhk  One example of this is how Damien had the Arrow ip choked with a chain and the Arrow somehow manages to throw an Arrow with enough force while he can't breathe that, Damien, a former league of assassins member couldn't dodge the arrow  The episode of Sara Lance getting her soul back was even more stupid, the writers had to forge some crap out of thin air to get her back, I thought something interesting might happen you know? Thea dies, but no, they just made a magician in their writing out of thin air because why not right? We don't want our main characters to die so let's not let them  The Flash, the only series I like because everything that happens is for a reason and the things behind it are great except one thing, I don't understand why the Flash doesn't just carry his meta-humans into the cage which they can't get out of instead of fighting them? He can do that before they can react can't he? Anyway, I know the Flash will win in some stupid way that they will just bring in, or something that makes no sense will happen and he will beat Zoom  This is just a constant repetition in all the series that I have listed and frankly, it's boring to watch and a waste of time  ",1,-0.2,1,"Negative"

Too many situations in The Flash could have been resolved quickly if only Barry could remember  hey, I can run really really fast   When the writers assume that the viewers are morons I just stop watching Doesn't anyone realize that just because Savage is immortal doesn't mean he can't be tied up?Plus I can't help but cringe every time I hear Snart or Rory speak  ",1,-0.4,1,"Negative"

"Legends of Tomorrow","2016-01-24"," If you watch this kind of show, then you know which one this series is attempting to copy  As my thirteen-year-old son told me, after we saw the first episode,  master  is a synonym for  lord  In a forced attempt to make this one somehow different from Greg Berlanti's other three shows ( Arrow,   Flash,  and  Supergirl ), this one apparently includes attempted comedy  It doesn't work very well because, first, all four of these clones have their characters tossing snarky lines around, so the contrast isn't very stark, and, second, the silly things they say do contrast internally: with the serious things they say  It's as though the characters alternate between short speeches about the grandeur of their individual destinies, and the silliness inherent in asking a nerd if he's ever played football On top of all that, there is a serious plot flaw that appears at the end of the first episode, which (no spoilers here) forces the viewer to accept the idea that all of these people will agree to something that at least a few of them would realize might be a very bad idea  It is simply not believable  (I know, that's a word with little application to a show about comic book superheroes, but there are lines, and there are lines, right?)For context, I would score the foursome this way:Arrow, 8 0 (trending down)Supergirl, 7 5 (trending up)Flash, 7 0 (trending flat)Legends of Tomorrow 4 0 (but I'll watch two more, at least)Note: I went to a science fiction convention a week ago  One of the discussion panels was about how so many of us are suffering from  superhero overload  from TV shows like this one  It was a popular panel, with the consensus being very, very one-sided  I sense the end is near for a lot of this stuff, at least on TV  ",4,-0.2,3.8,"Negative"

"Legends of Tomorrow","2016-01-22"," It's odd to see legendary premise from Seven Samurais implemented with supporting heroes from DC Universe and time travel gimmick  This is similar to a sport team made out of benchwarmers, without being too rude, and it can be disjointed at times  However, the theme of being better than the destined supporting roles resonate in rather realistic fashion for these misfits and its bombastic approach is surprisingly fun in contrast of trending gritty vibe for superheroes nowadays Brandon Routh, formerly Superman, now goes by the name of Atom is a welcomed addition  He has good screen presence and it's nice to see him don another superhero suit in more prominent role  Wentworth Miller and Dominic Purcell once again become brothers years after their Prison Break time together  They've done this before and it seems they find comfortable place among the crew Victor Garber, the half part of Firestorm and Caity Lotz, now White Canary are proper additions  Garber has done so many roles similar to this and he fits the mentor personality, while Lotz looks fine for the tough female character  She is athletic for the part, she's also gradually separating herself from love interest character into a more establish one  Arthur Darvill as the new lead Rip Hunter looks enigmatically resembling Constantine, though he seems decent for the glue that keeps the band together These are the most likely to have chemistry across times  Unfortunately, this type of gathered heroes gig needs everyone to play their part  The Hawk duo is still inconsistent, they lack connection and the level or refined acting, and this is more visible when they play important part on the plot  Franz Drameh, the face of Firestorm has not meshed well with the rest either, the character looks too forced even if he's paired with more experienced Victor Garber For visual candy purpose, they haven't skimped on the production  Effects from The Flash and Arrow translate well here  Atmosphere is leaning towards The Flash's lighter ambiance as the show gives more time for humor, thus the inevitable corny one-liner  Few of these appear highly flashy and haphazardly thrown together, although they are entertaining to have nonetheless The assembly from lesser characters can be risky and hectic, yet the better parts of the production and cast present an enjoyable ride  Besides, it's always good to watch the talented actors given more spotlights and experience a more merry leisure than melancholy or melodramatic shows  ",7,0.6,7.6,"Positive"

"Legends of Tomorrow","2016-01-22"," It's difficult writing this review as I am a big DC fan and was anticipating this show for a while  But from a critical perspective, this show definitely utilizes some of the lesser known DC characters and groups them together in a new superhero offering, with a certain degree of success The story-line is not too difficult to follow, and the first episode certainly paints a picture of things to come, so I am quietly optimistic the concept will deliver  There are plenty of angles to explore with the idea of time travel, so hopefully this show has proved it has created an unusual yet refreshing team worth watching There are some downfalls - some of the dialogue seems strained, and at this early stage there isn't a lot of character interaction, much like a JLA comic from the 1950's  I am personally not a fan of having Captain Cold nor Heatwave on the show, as their combination of sneering and screaming acting is somewhat cringe-worthy  I would've preferred to see some of the lesser known JLA instead, such as Vixen or Zatanna Brandon Routh seems to be the standout star of the show as his character is the most likable and appealing  The rest of the cast   well, time will tell The makers of this show have done a thorough job and it shows  I am hopeful this show will create a whole new direction in superhero television programs  ",8,0.4,8.4,"Positive"

NO  The Hawks are really annoying,an ex Superman that nobody liked, all though DC doesn't care about it  and they used him again,the 2 ex prison break brothers with their annoying speech problem they have, arrow's ex girlfriend who died in arrow and got resurrected,a doctor who character and the duo firestorm  and tah tah   we have a boring predictable super hero new TV show  ",5,-0.2,4.8,"Negative"
"Legends of Tomorrow","2016-01-22"," It's true    these are the characters that are widely forgettable  Don't get me wrong, I liked Palmer in Arrow and I even like Stein, but Firestorm was better with Ronnie than with  Jax   Hell, I even enjoyed Snart as a bad guy even though his dialogue and mannerisms were very cartoony  But for the rest    I never liked Sarah Lance, Heatwave is a very one-dimensional pun, Jax (the lesser half of Firestorm) is whiny and obnoxious, and the Hawk-duo are horrendous  For one (this is nit picking and probably in bad taste) I can't get past her mouth and how big her teeth are    I honestly find it distracting  Also, on the same note: why does Sarah Lance always look like she's trying to do  duck- face?  What is it with the CW and employing actresses with good bodies but weird faces? Anyway    The story idea at heart is good, but it loses momentum when you learn is a personal vendetta with Rip Hunter  It would have been better if the time council wanted Vandal Savage dealt with  The script is awkward like Arrow has become  Arrow was good until all of the good writers left and went to Flash  Nothing feels natural and most of the dialogue feels exposition-y  The only saving grace is that it removes so many annoying characters from Flash And Arrow and locks them in this world to never bother us again  But I did like Palmer and wish he would come back to Arrow  Overall, bad show  I'll keep watching just because I have now seen the first episode and feel compelled to keep watching to keep up continuity with the other two shows because I bet there's going to be cross-overs  ",4,-0.1,3.9,"Negative"
"Legends of Tomorrow","2016-01-22"," Yes, SOME OF IT is kind of for kids   But I loved it!!! Though I wish it gets more  mature  with time  There are good actors here, so there's a lot of potential for good drama and character development, too  Still, there are just a couple of things I didn't like  I mean, Chronos is just ONE villain and not even a couple of them could hit him ONCE   That's just   not good  If one of them can't even hit the mark once, why did Rip Hunter got them together? They're supposed to be good!!! Another thing is that some of the dialogue can be a bit cheesy   SOOOO, those are the couple of things   Everything else is just perfect  There was one person here who said that if Rip had the Time Machine he could've gone back in time just to save his child and his wife and leave with them  But then, what good would that do if Savage is out there in the world ready to obliterate everyone? And Rip said, that fate and time somehow are bound together   So, in order to change the future, well, it's just really hard, hence going back to bring some  superheroes   Anyway, I LOVED IT!!!! I want more and I want more from the characters! More action, drama and character development   If it gets to cheesy and fun, then it will go down   BUT I have faith that that will NOT HAPPEN!!!!

"Legends of Tomorrow","2016-01-22"," Having waited over 7 months to see this show, it's fair to say this show has definitely lived up to, and beyond all expectations! Being a very big fan of the sister shows, Arrow and The Flash it was very interesting to see where exactly this show would fit in  Providing amasses of light and fun humour with a very enjoyable, albeit dysfunctional, superstar team completely changes the scene of superhero TV  The characters themselves are very easy to relate to as is the villain himself, Vandal Savage  A great decision to bring back Arrow character, Sara Lance to the cast as well as others from the previous two shows, giving the show a great sense of familiarity if you do watch the other two, but not so that you'd feel out of place in the slightest if you don't watch the other two  Honestly I believe this show is definitely one to check out, I really wouldn't be able to find any flaws so far  When watching it, due to the shorter season and therefore bigger budget, the show gives off the appearance of a Hollywood blockbuster  Marc Guggenheim and Andrew Kreisberg have done it again and brought us a show with brilliant special effects, great scripts and just all round badass-ery! :) ",10,0.8,10,"Positive"
"Lucifer","2017-10-02"," Not bad for a Soap Opera title, right? But it happens to be 100% true  Unlike my other  family in Christ,  I can watch a funny send up of the entire religion thing because BEING a full-on believer in Jesus Christ is the religion NOT the churches so-called Christians who seem to easily mix weird words from man and often worship whoever their priest or pastor is instead of believing you can read the Bible with friends and/or family and get the message  Not just GET the message, but also watch fun, entertaining Hollywood nonsense and not stray from the pack!On behalf of the many more sold out Christians, I apologize for those who are brain-washed or generally wobbly about their faith  He gave us FREE WILL  He knows our heart  And He trusts us as we trust Him  Period  It's JUST ENTERTAINMENT (and excellent entertainment at that!)  Now to the show  Yes, Tom Ellis and Lauren German are beautiful and I loved every minute of seasons 1 and 2  Bringing in Tom Welling was the networks' most brilliant move so far this season  While other shows are bleeding characters (Hawaii five-0 comes to mind and others), Lucifer is pushing the ante up by throwing my hero for many, many years, Tom Welling, into the mix and who can argue with Superman? The show revolves around Lucifer, DB Woodside his hunky brother, Amenadiel, and Lauren German as the beautiful cop who starts out trying to catch Lucifer as a criminal but let's say a romance evolves, and Lucifer/Amenadiel's mother, played by Tricia Helfer, who I'm not sure is in this season, and Rachel Harris, total comedy relief is Lucifer's therapist That's pretty much the show - now why I watch it  Simply put: it's pure entertainment  Not heavy, a lot of humor, great ensemble cast, and a far fetched story meant NOT to hurt or help NOT to damage one's own belief  If your faith is that sketchy that what is basically a fantasy show, then I'm afraid you'd better never let your kids watch ANY Disney movie! I live my life out of joy in my faith, not looking over everybody else's shoulder telling them what they should and should not do  And if you all think I'm kidding about being a full on Christian, I will give you my Christian search and final acceptance story including a prophesy gift God gave me during my last operation  NOTHING WILL EVER SHAKE MY FAITH IN GOD AND Jesus Christ  But I am ashamed of many brothers and sisters still in their baby seat, sucking their thumbs, afraid of liberals, afraid of a bad word, afraid of Lucifer! Because I love this show as does my SAVED husband - who actually watched it first 2 years ago and said,  Kathy, you are going to LOVE this show,  to which I responded  HEATHEN! Get thee behind me Satan,  and then here I am, 2 years later writing this  It's one of those  Didn't see THAT coming,  things  I love this show people! Come love it with me! You won't lose your salvation over it! And non-believers, you have no excuse! Also, if you (ABC) Change this winning formula to a darker side of everything: BIG MISTAKE! Don't fix what isn't broken!!

"Lucifer","2017-09-29"," I rarely write reviews but I wanted to add some clarification because fans of the comic are too harsh for this TV series  First this is like 1000 times better than the comic  Yes the comic evolves around a deep , complex , rich story  There is two problems with its story a) its far from original (see Spawn) b) the characters are plain boring  Its very difficult in the comic to differentiate one character from the other , they are miserable and they are also miserable    oh did I say they are also miserable  On the other side we have this TV series  In comparison with the comic is pretty much the polar opposite  The story is extremely simple yet very original , the very few characters that is has very well written , interesting and multi dimensional that do not go down the misery stereotypical writing that anything relate to the devil goes usually  Let's get one thing straight the comic is a drama this is a comedy  No its not a cop show  Yeah sure the theme is cop related but in the end, if you take out Lucifer and Chloe this becomes the most boring cop show you ever watched  The murders investigated are far, far ,far from interesting and they don't play any more than a decoration role for the series  The series has more in common with Californication than it has with CSI , Law and Order etc  It should not surprise its made by the same writer  Essentially this polarises on the relation of Lucifer and Chloe, with every character just being there to push the story further  It also does not glorify Satan by any means  The comic does far better job at that actually  Lucifer is NOT himself  This is something that is made clear from episode 1  First because he decides he is fed up with the role of Satan and wants to explore something else  Second and this is the most important is that he finds, again from very early on, that he is physically vulnerable when he is around Chloe  What is implied is also that he emotionally vulnerable when he is around her as well and the more exposed he becomes to her the more vulnerable he becomes  The final blow on the whole  glorifies Satan  comes when we find in Season 2 why Chloe is so special and why the whole story is far from accidental and has little to do with  the power of love  as you would expect in a typical romantic series  In the end this is too binary to be compared to the comic or a typical cop show and too out of character to be blamed for Satan glorification  For the same reasons it cannot even remotely compare to Supernatural which by the way has a lot more common with the comic than this has  Instead this is a remake of the Californication story and its great remake even though much more simple  Mainly because of the extreme amount of layers that the characters have  But mostly because of the chemistry between Chloe and Lucifer  The show like Californication has much more to do with the human condition that is has to do with religion and mythology  Its semi serious look into the human condition from the perspective of very interesting characters with their own flaws and weakness  ",9,0,9,"Positive"
"Lucifer","2017-09-22"," What I really love about this show are the one liners that Tom Ellis gets that really make me laugh out loud What I don't like is the obligatory drop dead gorgeous female detective who just stepped off the catwalk  Seriously she is so pure Lucifer is unable to manipulate her like he does every other human, He can also get shot when he's near her, well not in the pilot when he takes half dozen without any ill effects but by the 4th episode he's no longer immortal, that is simply stupid  OK so they want to keep up the fact that he is the devil from her but for how long? So why do American producers always put these dolly birds in these parts? I wouldn't care if they cast someone overweight and less good looking as long as they can act the part So for that reason I've knocked a couple of stars off  Sure it is yet another buddy cop show as some of the negative reviewers have stated  However what can you do new these days?

The bible doesn't really give answers to supernatural beings and the story before creation of earth  Choosing LA (the city of sins) as the main location makes perfect sense  As well as showing the devil making trouble on earth  Amenadiel, Uriel, Mazekeen and Azrael are interesting variations of the classic angels Raphael, Gabriel and Michael  I don't know whether this happened out of respect, or out of creativity, but it works very well  The situations and dialogues happening because of the confrontation of human beings and supernatural ones are hilarious and interesting to watch  This show offers so many likable and interesting characters it is a pleasure to watch  ",9,1.2,10,"Positive"

No  After some time i start to believe again that there is something, still believing deep inside me that is God, and i met great woman, and she is really gift from God  Everyday i go to dental clinic, because that is place where i work  Everyday i cause little pain to my patients, is that what i want? no  i don't enjoy in their pain but job need to be done  everyday i hearing  i hate dentist   Do you see patern?Its hypocritically to judge Devil to have different opinion from God when we (humans) have free will  So at the end i have question for you all, is Devil bad guy or had that kind of work? :P ",10,-0.2,9.8,"Positive"

That's because if you expect the philosophical stuff about humans and angels, fathers and sons, sin, punishment and redemption, you have the wrong address  And if you're here for absurd dark humor, fresh and weird story lines, and unconventional take on one of the most enthralling characters the mankind has come up with, don't waste your time   Boring  is not the first word that comes to mind when thinking about the Devil, but it describes Fox' Lucifer pretty neatly  ",1,0.1,1.1,"Negative"
"Lucifer","2017-04-02"," This show is amazing! It is my favorite show of all time and can't believe that season one has only four stars and season two has only three  At least that's what Hulu says for star ratings  I hope they make a season three and many more after that  If I could rate it, I would definitely rate it a full five stars  ",10,0.3,10,"Positive"
"Lucifer","2017-03-24"," After watching all of the first season of this show, I have to say that I still am not quite sure if I really like it or not  I will note that I have never read the graphic novel upon which this series is loosely based, so my opinion of the show is based on how it is as a stand alone idea  On one hand, there are certain things about this series that I enjoy  Most of the actors bring decent performances to their roles, and Tom Ellis as Lucifer is pretty entertaining to watch  Lucifer is funny and his existential crisis is an amusing subplot  He's also kind of an asshole with chronic foot-in-mouth, but that's part of his character  Chloe is also likable and I'd have to say she's probably the main reason I finished watching the entire season, because I enjoy her character and the family drama she has going on  The uneasy relationship Chloe has with Lucifer is another point that makes the show interesting at times  Contrary to some reviewers, I actually enjoy that Lucifer is kind of a decent guy struggling with the conflict between his perceived nature and the person that he actually wants to be  The show is not without its faults, though  In fact, it has plenty  The writing is mediocre and from other reviews I've read it apparently deviates heavily from the source material  The other main issue is that it's yet another run of the mill police procedural with a supernatural spin (many echoes here of shows like Brimstone, Forever Knight, Moonlight, Reaper, etc)  There isn't much originality here at all and it really drags the show down  If the producers had tried to stick even a little more to the graphic novel then maybe this show could have been something special, but what we got instead is a fairly dumbed-down rehash of a story that's been told by Hollywood many times before  Many of the episode plot lines are shallow and predictable, and like so many other shows these days it tries too hard to be trendy and hip, which detracts from the overall theme  Lucifer as a series could benefit greatly from a little more darkness and a lot less flashy LA club culture  Speaking of LA, I think it's a terrible setting for the show (though, having not read the graphic novel, I don't know if this is where it's meant to be set?)  They could have had this show set in a number of different cities and it would have been a better choice, in my opinion  Despite the complaints I have with this show, I still watched a whole season and I think I may stick around for Season 2, but if there are no improvements to the writing or the other less favorable elements I mentioned above, I don't believe I will continue watching in the long run  This show could have been great in the right hands, but currently it's awfully mediocre and in need of a serious overhaul  I do see some promise in the premise, however, so I'm not ready to write it off just yet  ",5,0.2,5.2,"Negative"
"Lucifer","2017-03-19"," Lucifer is some kind of politically correct new man, a so-called metrosexual  That premise can never work  He has to be bad-ass, offensive, nasty and un-PC  No actor can make devil-as-campy-metrosexual work because it doesn't make sense and is not in any way interesting or fun  He is watchable, at least at first, until his character becomes irritating, but it's not his fault  The same actor would be great in a bad-ass role  Instead the show demands him to be camp and rather pathetic  OK, so Lucifer is a total wet blanket  What are we left with? The female cop  What does he see in her? She's as interesting as a cardboard box  And has zero sex appeal  Also, she sees things that are impossible, comments that they are impossible, but then does not seem curious  Oh, this guy is obviously supernatural, but I'll just sweep that to one side  That is, of course, insanely unintelligent  Then you have the female psychologist - yawn  And the pointless naggy brother angel character, an affirmative-action hire presumably  And the sassy female angel Hell girl, who is also pretty pointless, she's there to protect the Devil? So even his mortality creates no suspense  Oh dear  I watched the first 6 episodes, and then watched the last episode of season two - mostly skipping the many slow bits  The show is dull dull dull and dumb as HELL  Avoid!

This one has really grabbed hold of and kept my interest  And I'm easily bored and hyper-critical, very very few shows manage to meet my standards  This plots been done so many times before, in both television and movies, that it should be growing moss(even the twists are worn out)  Though,I have to say the show has a partly episodic nature(of course), it does have a good, strong story-line that consistently continues throughout Characters are so clichéd, it's criminal  And I'm hooked on every single one's ongoing story line The way they've tried to show us Lucifer's inner thoughts,feelings, inner struggles, is an equally trite and familiar character  A lazy writer's narrative plot tool  But I love it, can't wait see how that subplot continues  The main actor's British accent sounds unbelievable fake  It's utterly charming  (This one was a mystery at first  I knew that Tom Ellis was from Britain - what was going on? After listening to a few interviews and hearing his real voice - he's just really hamming it up more than a few notches for the show  ( Some might think it's because he actually has a Welsh accent But he was just born in Wales, he didn't grow up there) The set designs are beyond cheesy  And yet, their quality is obviously very high - it's easy to see that money and attention was spent here I could go on and on   ---I gave this an 8, but honestly I'm not sure what to rate it  This show has me completely baffled  Why do I like it so much?

"Lucifer","2016-12-25"," I started watching this out of pure boredom with relatively low expectations  Seemed like it was going to be another lame, cheesy take on a supernatural story  I was wrong  Okay   it may be a little bit cheesy but it's extremely entertaining and the writers do a great job of playing its strengths such as clever one liners and well played humor By end of the first episode Tom Ellis will have you completely charmed  Devilish indeed  There aren't many things you won't let the man get away with because he just does it all so well  No other actor could take this material and run with it so brilliantly  Then just when you think he can't get any better Tom jumps on the piano with beautiful performances, some with and without vocals, of very classy choices such as  Sinner Man ,  Unforgiven ,  Knockin on Heaven's Door , and  All Along the Watchtower   The man has the voice of an angel, pun intended Alongside Tom Ellis is Lauren German  I wasn't particularly familiar with her prior to Lucifer and that was my loss  She plays the more serious half of the duo  Despite being the  bad cop  of the two, German is extremely clever, sexy, and quite funny  Her smile absolutely lights up the screen The casting is strong in this one  Mazikeen, portrayed by Lesley Ann Brandt, is a fun and devious demon  Kevin Alejandro does a great job as well playing one of the less gratified roles (in my opinion)  D B  Woodside as Amenadiel and Rachel Harris as Linda are also quite remarkable  Ten stars on this aspect In this decade ruled by giants such as Game of Thrones, The Walking Dead, and the spectacular new Westworld, it's hard to believe this PG-13 rated show can hold its own  Admittedly, I would've liked to see Lucifer without the restraints of the rating holding back all the real life profanity and adult content that we've been accustomed to in recent years  I'm pleased to say that does little to dim the talent and enjoyment of this show  The story holds your attention, the production value is superb, and the performances are top notch  I hope to see many more seasons to come  ",9,0.9,9.9,"Positive"
"Lucifer","2016-12-22"," I won't go into the story because it's basically self explanatory except for Lucifer's relationship with a female cop! The problem with Lucifer is he looses his abilities, which there doesn't seem to have many, when he is in the presence of Chloe, the Botox ridden co star of the show! I am in disbelief how any producer could cast Lauren German when she can't move her face at all! If you mute the TV you would have no idea what's going on! I couldn't figure out why I hated her acting so much until I realized she is both a terrible actor and has lost the ability to show emotion! I really enjoy the main character of Lucifer and his cohorts and find they are the only thing keeping this show going! The story line is full of holes and stupid scenarios so you have to retire your brain while watching 'Lucifer' but the occasional humorous quip from Lucifer keeps me watching  I really wish the writers would add some realistic characters like a psychiatrist who doesn't fall apart when confronted with Lucifer true self! Personally, I would be fascinated with Lucifer and would have many questions but the psychiatrist nearly has a breakdown and doesn't have any questions! A little realism would help shows like this! I am a little surprised Lucifer has been allowed more seasons considering how lame it is but i suppose with the numerous terrible shows around makes Lucifer more attractive to viewers! I would give the show a few more stars if Lauren German wasn't in it and not so annoying and replaced with someone who could actually act, but that isn't happening! ",5,-0.1,4.9,"Negative"
"Lucifer","2016-12-19"," This show has a fun premise and I started watching it to see how the character Lucifer would be interpreted for the TV-watching public  In my opinion, he should be sinfully delicious  So my number-one gripe is I just don't like the main character or the actor playing him, for the following reasons: 1  Too whiny  At least once per episode he whines,  Detective!  I'm no satanist, but I don't picture the Lord of Darkness as a whiny eight- year-old  This reminds me of my students (when I was teaching grade two) saying,  But, miss!  when I wouldn't let them eat candies at morning snack  2  Too ambivalent  They have had a lot of opportunities for the Prince of Darkness to really get all red-eye- glow burned-face furious, and really make the most of those neat special effects from the first episode, but when this devil becomes enraged he just seems kind of peeved  3  Not really that attractive  I get that they were going for a Pierce Brosnan James Bond-type, but Tom Ellis does not ooze sexuality, no matter how many overpriced dapper suits and silk shirts with the top two buttons open they dress him in  Again, he looks a woman in the eye with an air of ambivalence  And he's got a bit of a small chin  4  Rather powerless  Really? Beelzebub, the Evil One, the King of Babylon has the power to make some people admit what they really want, by asking them what they really want? Oh, and he can make a coin with satanic symbols on it float in mid air and spin a little bit  I think it would at least be cooler if he just had to look at you and you admitted your deepest darkest secrets, but then it would be too easy to solve murder cases, wouldn't it? And it irritates him so much that this detective is impervious to his power (also difficult to believe, since he is the Lord of the Underworld and all that) that he starts following her around like a puppy    or maybe an eight year old   Other problems that get in the way of this being the really great show it has the potential to be: 1  Detective Chloe Decker has zero personality  At least give Satan someone interesting to follow around and whine at  2  Detective Dan Espinoza (Detective Douche) has zero personality  3  There is no way that child is the product of Detective Chloe and Detective Douche  So who's the real father? Oops, was that a spoiler? Or did the casting directors flunk out of high school biology and miss the part about genetics? I know this isn't a show about science, it's a show about a very weakly portrayed superstition, but this little casting screw-up makes the viewing public who DID go to high school feel like it's aimed at a somewhat stupider demographic It's kind of entertaining, but I don't think I'll be upgrading my cable package to get access to future seasons  ",6,-0.4,5.6,"Negative"

"Lucifer","2016-11-16"," Let's start off with the fact that I am not religious at all and I did not read the comic, so I am able to review this title quite objectively  Lucifer starts of as a quite exciting detective with a little twist, you won't see your average cop duo with an uninteresting story line  In a way, it is actually a bit similar to the show Sherlock  The main character Lucifer is brilliant, his character makes constant references to heaven/hell/religion on a different and funny manner  The fact that he is the only British person in the show (so far) emphasizes the fact that he is 'different' to say the least  Since he is the devil he has some benefits that come with it like being immortal and being able ask for someones deepest desires  These powers, however, have no effect on his partner, a female cop and ex actress  While this idea sounds great, the actress for Chloe could have been played by someone else  Her personality and face are sometimes distracting during intense scenes  The main story line is simple, but interesting and enjoyable  I like the fact that they do not put a label on religion, they do not criticize religion nor do they praise it  They do, however, make the occasional jokes with a religious background like when Lucifer is asked whether Lucifer Morningstar is a real name or stage name, Lucifer replies:  God given I'm afraid   It is these kinds of jokes that make the show the brilliant show it is  I would like to give this show an 8 5, but I am forced to compensate for the sheer amount of negative reviews for religious reasons  ",10,0.3,10,"Positive"

Despite using the cliché murder mysteries as a framing device, the focus is still on the Lucifer's shenanigans and relationships, what makes for a show that is very funny and refreshing  Though most of it feels like an endless party, there are even some genuine emotional moments here and there  Even the clichéd cop mysteries is done competently, if not greatly  To be honest, I never expect great things from this show when it comes up, but I do expect to have one hell of a good time  Pun intended  ",8,0.3,8.3,"Positive"

Lucifer is a free loader, but one who doesn't care about material goods  He's enjoying himself, dishing out punishments while humans are still alive  That must be quite a change for him  I can't help but wish he came to Washington to punish rotten politicians, but alas, he got hooked by a pretty detective in the City of Angels  One good, honest cop, he watches over  Lucifer is always a bit frantic  God is always on his tail, so to speak, trying to derail his pleasure train by using humans as pawns for is eternal fight against the Dark Prince  Quite a change of perspective and a refreshing one, even if the whole concept is ludicrous  The good devil also speak with a British accent  Somehow, nobody could believe the show would work with an American accent  I guess the Devil works in mysterious ways too  Lucifer is simply the best show I've seen on TV since «Dead Like Me»  ",10,0.1,10,"Positive"

Well, the first season didn't impress much  It was entertaining to a certain degree without any offensive indications to less fanatically religious sectors, from my point of view  They didn't make him your every day hero but ironically despite Lucifer having selfish intentions & ideologies his non-heroic acts turn out to be quite the heroics! The intensity & chemistry between the actors have improved tremendously in Season 2 and the script has definitely improved!

It was a thrill which literally carried goosebumps on my body when the face of hidden Lucifer is shown  I was tumbled at this moment of time as it was an awestruck moment  Her mother is one suspicious character  One important thing is the characters are slowly and steadily being revealed which indicates there's much more to come My Rating for this show is a Total 10 Just waiting for the next episode  ",10,0.2,10,"Positive"

Yep, red eyes  Then there is the other cheap Satanic effect floating whatever - people, objects  Again, not to be outdone they added a floating coin and apple - both effects pointless, besides really cheaply done  4  90+% of this series is low budget close up filming with cheap props, sets, costumes, just a few actors with lots of talking and no words too difficult for high school beyond 10th grade  OK, Ellis (Luc) does give us some fun dialogue, but that's about all that's worth the hours of one's life  5  It's just boring, uncreative, ripoff writing  ",2,-0.7,1.3,"Negative"

There is no mention of the lore or Lucifer's role as a fallen angel  He's just simply there to be obtuse and annoying  For me, the character had NO likability or charm, and the fact they stereotypically chose a standard British accent (although Tom is Welsh with no traces of Welsh accent, since that's probably too foreign for Americans) only adds to the annoyance  Those interested in cop shows should skip this show as well  It's unprofessional and the case-solving is shallow and ridiculous  Loftyonthehill described the show as  tired, wooden and nonsensical cop show  Nothing more, nothing less , which is about right  I would add uninspiring as well  If you have nothing better to do, watch it, if you're dying to see a good show, pleaaasseee skip this junk  Maybe your teenage daughter will like this  ",5,-0.4,4.6,"Negative"

"Lucifer","2016-05-31"," If you're a fan of detective shows and flirt a bit with fiction then this is the show for you  It's a fun light-hearted drama series based on the fallen Angel himself Lucifer played by British actor Tom Ellis  He decides to take a break from hell and stay in Las Angeles where he buys a club and lives a life of sin  He soon meets a detective by the name of Chloe Decker played by Lauren German  It takes a while to get used to her, as her acting skills aren't exactly polished  Though you tend to give her the benefit of the doubt due to her stunning eyes, but she does grow into her role  The two start working together on cases in an unconventional way at first, with Lucifer liking the thrill of hunting bad guys and the fact the Chloe bats away his advances, which no other woman can resist, including Psychiatrist Linda Martin played by Rachel Harris  Chloe and Lucifer interrogate her and then she becomes a series regular whereby she listens and tries to help Lucifer and his so called 'delusions' of being the Devil and in return he ahem    The series develops with a not-so-fallen Angel trying to return Lucifer back to guard the gates of hell, which he had abandoned  However Lucifer is in no desire to leave the freedom of earth, he's enjoying himself way too much  Tom Ellis' performance really brings out the best of this character and is a joy to watch his arrogant, self-centered character go from just that to develop certain human-like traits as the show progresses  You tend to sympathise with him, which is weird because he is the Devil and the Devil is probably the last person you'd ever think to identify yourself with  A good all round show with an interesting cliffhanger that will keep you waiting for Season 2  ",7,0,7,"Positive"
"Lucifer","2016-05-30"," For anyone to go into this without any preconceived notions will find this to be ridiculously entertaining  If your looking for the lulz you won't find them as some of them are subtle and to focus entirely on that can make the true intent of the screenplay and the thrill of story telling pointless  The whole point of Lucifer's character is shrouded in a mysterious persona and from that angle add in a volatile tongue and quick witted remarks and intellectual humor makes this mind boggling series amusing Pretend the character is like a stone in an ocean  And Lucifer's whole perception of his take on his interests is him fancifully skipping rocks so it always hits the stone in the seemingless endless ocean  He knows his stuff and isn't afraid to protrude into the minds of people as this gives him benefit of the doubt whenever he finds himself in situations that require little to no thinking Lucifer just knows and thats the antenna to the satellite that people don't connect  The trick is to watch this series while you experience life and how it really does tell a realm of possibility that exists and has been taken out of from  I mean Lucifer? The heavenly beautiful angel that takes a vacation to the human world? And he has made  friends  with a female?

"Lucifer","2016-05-22"," I've tried to keep it spoiler free, but I'm sorry if there still are any  Lucifer  is an adaptation of the character Lucifer, also known as the angel of death (not sure though)  But he has abandoned hell, and he has entered our world, where he meets Chloe, a police officer  With her he starts to solve mysteries, and that's the main premise of the series The directing of the series is very good, and consistent  The consistent part is very important, otherwise you would have a incoherent show, which isn't good, as you could've guessed  Of course this isn't the only thing that makes the show great, or that makes directors great  The directors didn't choose any shaky cam, and used all steady cam  I very much like this style  The fight scene in the finale was surprisingly good  I was genually surprised by this, because the shows fight scenes were most of the time small scale, but this time it was bigger    And better  The fight choreography was also fantastic  Way better than  Arrow , a show that's known for its fighting scenes  The cinematography was also just perfect  It felt like I was watching a movie, well, a short one  It's of course no  Fargo  or  Mr  Robot  (just to name a few recent shows) but it's good  The sound was also good, and not notably bad  But the soundtrack, boy the soundtrack  This was the absolute star of the show  I absolutely loved the idea of using music in the theme of god/heaven/hell/devil etc  This just made the show more fun  The editing was also good  I didn't really looked after mistakes, so there are of course things that are wrong, but nothing of putting  The make-up, as for they used some, was also pretty good The acting now  Well, this is a yes and no  The main actor is Tom Ellis  He absolutely nails the part  He is fantastic and believable as the character of the devil  Buuuuuut at times his acting capability just seemed to disappear and line deliveries were bad  For the most part though he was fantastic, but at moments I was thinking: What just happened? How come he delivered that line thát bad? He was intimidating when he needed too, and he didn't make me laugh at those times  It could've been possible if he was a complete bad actor  The person he teams up with is Chloe, she is played by Lauren German  Her acting was also pretty good  Nothing that really impressed me, though  She also has a daughter in the show, who actually plays a relatively big role  This role is played by Scarlett Estevez  Scarlett was fine  She really had her bad moments, but she still is very young, so I guess she'll evolve into a better actress  The supporting cast was also very good, I'll just skim over them really quick: Maz was good, Dan too, D B  Woodside who played Amenadiel was very good The script was also fantastic  The dialogue was absolutely great  This, and the music, were the things that got me hooked immediately  The script writers managed to create a very well fleshed out character, and every line made it feel like this was something that the character would say  I'm obviously talking about the character of Lucifer Morningstar  He was funny, sarcastic, and amazing overall  He was very likable too  The character had a dark past, and has to deal with his things, and they put this down amazingly  Buuuuuuut (again) he is the only one that was really fleshed out  I understand that they did this, but I think that they should've given Chloe too a good character  They tried to do this, by the marriage side plot, with Dan, but this didn't work out  And that were a lot of 'buts'  Chloe was also annoying at times, because she couldn't seem to understand that Lucifer really was the devil  This was annoying, and stupid, because she is supposed to be a smart character  A thing a quickly want to mention is that I very much enjoyed the perspective that they took with this series  Telling it from the eyes of the devil himself  I know that this is an adaptation, but still  The 'crime of the week' thing they did, did work out for me  I would've loved that they payed more attention to the main story of the series  The first episode was very good, one of the best pilots I've seen  I say one of, because the pilot of  Mr Robot  is the best one I've ever seen  The middle episodes had it's good and bad moments, but the last two episodes were very good again  The villain, though, wasn't the greatest  It wasn't someone intimidating enough, sadly I also liked the tone of the show  It had a dark atmosphere, but it also had its funny moments, let me tell you, it is a funny show  And I want to mention this because that it's very impressive how they managed to switch quickly between those two tones Overall this was a fun and entertaining show  I'm glad that it got renewed, and I'm looking forward to the next season!9 5/10 ",9,1.5,10,"Positive"
"Lucifer","2016-05-20"," Finally a show that shows the devil  Lucifer  as not just some evil in the night waiting to prey on the innocent  But as someone who is here for a reason, to punish those who commit evil acts against other humans  Seeing how Lucifer interacts with and starts to relate to humanity is wonderful  The female lead is brilliantly done  Tough, smart and loving as a single mother as well as a teacher to Lucifer  I love how the people from hell are all effected by Trixie and a child's innocence  I think it will be something to see when Lucifer's brother Amenadiel has his interaction with the child  Patiently awaiting the next episode with their mother escaping from Hell  Does anyone have any idea on when it will air?

"Lucifer","2016-05-14"," I wrote a review about the first episode and will do the same about the last  In summary, I think the show missed the chance to do something different, but at least it kept the audience entertained  I skipped a few episodes in the middle because of internet band width and international travel issues so maybe i missed some classic TV but I think not  Tom Ellis's acting seems sound but i think they made a casting mistake  He is too pretty, and when he gets together with his brother the show starts to look decidedly camp  I would have gone for a more punk look for at least one of the two  In spite of the above I still gave the final episode a 7  I enjoyed it warts and all  ",7,-0.3,6.7,"Positive"
"Lucifer","2016-04-24"," This is one of the few shows I follow at the moment, but I am not sure as to why  The show is cheesy, sometimes badly acted (by side- or second rate characters)and the story feels more like if an alcoholic magician meets a detective and then they go out on a Castle-esque adventures  Never for a second I feel like this is actually about the Devil, and being an atheist I sort of dismiss the entire premise  Still, this is pretty good  I have watched every episode twice over so far and I cannot help liking the show  The two leads have great chemistry, some of the story lines are very good and decently fresh and at times I forget the objections I have above  If they bring in a little more other-worldly stuff and perhaps a better main antagonist this might become ever better  Well worth your time if you have nothing else to do  ",7,0.9,7.9,"Positive"
"Lucifer","2016-04-24"," The chemistry between the characters is amazing  I enjoy the interactions between Lucifer and the detective, but most of all I love watching the relationships between the angel Amenadiel, the demon Mazikeen and Lucifer himself - you really get the sense that they go back a long way, and their powerful, sexy, and violent interactions are always great fun to watch There are also some excellent performances by many of the actors playing smaller roles, such as Kevin Alejandro as another detective, and Kevin Rankin as yet another detective (without dropping any spoilers, these characters have a very cool story line in the later episodes of Season 1)  Another great performance is by Scarlett Estevez - it can be hard to watch child actors as they often visibly struggle with the concept of acting, though this one absolutely nails her role as the lead detective's daughter Some people complain about the procedural aspect of the show - a new crime each episode for the two leads to solve, though more often than not the crimes give Lucifer a platform for some interesting character development as he tries to find his way and his role in an unfamiliar human world  It should also be noted that unlike most other procedural cop shows, there is a very strong, fast-paced, and engaging focus on the over-arching story of the show, which in this case is a story of Lucifer as he rebels against those who would see him back in Hell and fights to have a say in he way he lives his life My only complaint would be that some of the writing for Lucifer's character can be cringe-worthy, in that while he can be very good with people and is usually the life of a party, he can also be very socially inept and incapable of seeing just how out-of-place some of the things he does are  Nonetheless, this can often make for some funny situations Overall, a great show with some really cool (and sexy) characters  Good fun to watch  ",9,0.8,9.8,"Positive"
"Lucifer","2016-04-23"," Let me get one thing straight - I have never read the comic, so I have no idea what the original story/character is like  Even so, I was expecting a heck of a lot more than this  This might just be the lamest, least original, most annoying take on the infamous fallen angel I've seen so far, and I've seen a LOT of them  It bothers me how they're trying so damned hard to make him look like this really cool and savvy guy, and yet he just comes across as obnoxious, patronizing and arrogant - and definitely not in a good way  I'd be okay with it if he was at least a LITTLE bit evil, but he's not  He's fighting crime  He punishes bad guys  He CARES about people  No, seriously - WTF? I think a lot of people would agree with me on this: If you watch a show titled  Lucifer , you're kind of HOPING for the evil anti-hero  Not this laughable excuse for a devil  Also, I've only seen the pilot episode so far, but the sheer amount of blatant misogyny in this one episode made me gag  The female detective tries so hard to be tough and stay on top of things, but with the way that this is written, she usually ends up looking like a naive fool next to the oh-so charming and witty prince of darkness  It's actually a bit sickening to watch  (And Christ, let's not even mention the singer who got shot  I'm absolutely disgusted by the way she was written ) The soundtracks are decent, I guess, but sadly not very original  Definitely the typical  rebel  soundtracks commonly used for this particular kind of show with this particular kind of title character  (How many times has  Howlin' for you  been used as a soundtrack by now? Good lord ) Overall, I'm just really disappointed  I was expecting so much more  ",2,-0.1,1.9,"Negative"
"Lucifer","2016-04-20"," The truth is, no show is without its faltering points  It is a bit on the tame side  It overly tries to downplay Lucifer's dark side, never actually allowing him to punish anyone but does an amazing job getting the viewer to feel and understand his plight  He is the torturer, the punisher, and justice bringer  He is not the monster humanity makes him out to be  Similar to Hades in Greek mythology  He's just a guy who's given a crap job and all that is bad is blamed on him  The acting is spot on for most characters  I wish they would let him loose for an episode or two and I think for the finale, they might  Overall a great show  Do not go the Constantine route with heavy foreshadowing of some dark force brewing  Supernatural has beaten that horse to death  ",8,-0.3,7.7,"Positive"
"Lucifer","2016-04-19"," Similar with many reviewers out here I was intrigued by the pilot episode, but the interest shortly waned afterwards with the many non-original detective episodes  Luckily I did not stop watching  The story line and character development moves quite fast after a lull of a few episodes mid-season, and by the pen-ultimate episode of season 1 the show is back in its glory The repetitive detective format is luckily the backdrop of a storyline, rather than the opposite  As the season progresses all sort of interesting dynamics happen between the main characters, whilst at the same time also introducing new characters with central roles  I am really looking forwards to the next episode PS: For those of you that thinks Lucifer is too 'human' - Lucifer makes a point in the penultimate episode of the season that he punishes evil, and asks thus why would he want evil to happen?

"Lucifer","2016-04-12"," This is a clever show, although they do rely a bit too heavily on Tom Ellis' charms to carry the hour  He's tap dancing as fast as he can to keep the action lively, but at the end of the hour I feel tired FOR him  The stories are engaging, but the rest of the cast is just not up to his level  Kevin Alejandro is poorly cast as the ex-husband  He is ordinary, and it is difficult to imagine our bold, confident heroine going for him in the first place or choosing him over Lucifer at the end of the day  For a triangle to work, both candidates need to be equally compelling My primary complaint is that the show is tinted a sickly green  Is this a creative choice? To make the female lead look like she's finishing up her third round of chemo?

"Lucifer","2016-03-24"," I really like this show! Stumbled onto it by accident  Didn't know what to expect  It's very loosely based on the DC comic character but the best way to watch it is for itself, rather than comparing it to the comic  I've been enjoying it a lot! Tom Ellis is perfect in the part of Lucifer, the devil who takes a holiday from Hell  Just devilish enough, just enough hints at how wicked he might actually be, but all the time with a devilish twinkle in his eye that makes him fascinating and likable in that way bad boys have of being likable  As the show progresses, his Lucifer character has gained complexity and depth that make him increasingly interesting The plots are pretty straightforward procedural cop show, as are the stock characters: the beautiful detective, the guy who doesn't want to be a dirty cop, the guy who is a dirty cop, and the various peripherals  But there's a sub-plot developing, manipulated by his yin yang counter-part, the archangel Amenadiel (played by D  B  Woodside with elegant smoothness and an unexpected hint of the sinister), which gives a continuing line to the episodes and will test the loyalties of the characters - and keep the audience watching  I have a feeling it may end up being the cliffhanger at the end of the season I find the show is at its best when it focuses on Lucifer himself  His charming bad boy persona is almost campy, but yet irresistible  And his moments of self-examination through the situations he gets into can be quite poignant  He doesn't understand the softer side of things, resents them, tries to subvert them, only to find sometimes he likes them, even needs them  And that could make him vulnerable  Tom Ellis does this with a subtlety that I find quite brilliant  As much as anything, I watch the show for him! I'm glad Fox (in Canada, it's on CTV) has given Lucifer the chance to find its footing, and I really hope they keep it going beyond this first season  ",9,0.6,9.6,"Positive"

"Lucifer","2016-03-05"," Well, this one is a Brit, and when it comes to hotness, Fox graced us with the most lame slogan there is: <U+0084>Hot as hell    Not that he is not <U+0096> Tom Ellis in this TV series is really a man to fall for  But can he save the show itself from falling? Because let's face it, Gaiman's character is the reason why we're all watching this  The mischievous, bored Majesty of Hell seeks change from the routine in the City of Angels, in which he makes a name by starting a club  That's the idea  The portrayal in Fox series is quite pleasant, not only to look at, but also to listen to  I'm not talking about the British accent here (but let's be honest, if the devil walks among us and wants to be as classy as human form allows, he's gonna speak British), but the replicas he was given  The sarcastic and contemptuous, yet funny and delightfully charming persona promises hopeful conversations, if he's given at least a bit capable partner to play off  The outright honesty with witch Lucifer calls himself by his true name and the childish joy with which he tells everyone is a brilliant and yet logical move  Why would Satan need to weave a mystery about himself? Thank God, that did not happen here and we're allowed to laugh at all his comments about the things between Earth and Heaven, or in heaven, that is  Thank you for not messing the main character up, FOX But you can't unsee the main premise no matter how damn sexy the devil is  Seven minutes into Pilot we learn that he starts to feel compassion when he gives a good and not at all satanic advice to the apparently dumb and untalented singer-star he obviously didn't have any deeper feelings for before  Not a minute later he becomes the second Bones to a Booth who is a detective with <U+0084>inherent good  in her  Let us all guess, FOX, she's immune to him, he is fascinated as to why and they both fall in love by season two  If there will be any  Because guys, you can't drag a boring crime procedural drama (of which we already have tons) just because the LAPD's little helper is a Prince of Darkness  Okay, let's go with the horribly wrong idea that the Devil himself can't resist the first slightly good person he meets and starts falling apart and being all sensitive and turning to the Light side because they have cookies and green light-sabers  Because that's why he came to the City of Angels for, forgiveness and reclamation of his seraphic status  The Devil  Anyways, a nice idea presents itself, and that's an idea of confused little Morningstar finding help at a psychologist's  Of course he doesn't admit he needs help, but he still doesn't use his diabolic powers to stop the brave woman from baring his soul to him  I am pretty inclined for this concept to work, if only it was followed through as an interesting idea it is, and not used just as a filling  Another thing which may put this series six feet under is the non existing capability of making a decision  There was once a detective Dancer who had a LAPD ex-husband portrayed by Nicolas Gonzales, whom she disliked quite a bit  And a daughter who took after him in appearance quite a bit  In second episode, however, there is a detective Decker who's ex- husband is a metro-sexual and uninteresting white male and who seems to be cooperating with him just fine  The daughter is, fortunately, the same, although I have to wonder if her mother doesn't lie to her father about something  Personally, I hate when people do recasting and rewriting after the episode was aired  It's absolutely okay to have an alternative Pilot like Sherlock did, which proposed a different theory on a case, but how the hell are you not sure about your main character's name? There is one name that sounds right, and that's because it's an original from the comic books, and that is the Archangel Amenadiel  His hatred for his fallen brother is exactly what it needs to be, and his message is clear: Get the hell back to hell, or all hell breaks loose  Which means that however much I like the time-slowing every time this messenger comes to scene, there should be an effect to his visits (or we just erase him like detective Dancer from the first episode)  I imagine we have two options here, either Lucifer sets his heart on staying and then we'll soon have Sam, Dean and Castiel arriving to help with the hordes, or he leaves and we'll have no show  Basically, are the makers strong enough to pull off a crime procedural fantasy horror supernatural haunting show? There's another thing that gives us solid two options of continuing, and that is the question of our inherently good detective finding out that Lucifer doesn't, in fact, lie about his identity  I don't recommend the creators to let her ignore the fact, because then they would have to re-do the first episode over one more time  I give detective Dancer, as a reasonable person, two more episodes to get her mind around the fact that Lucifer is, indeed, Lucifer  Then she, as a reasonable person, gets the hell out of Los Angeles and hides for her and her daughter's life  Or she could be a strong bad-ass female character and fight The Evil, but well, that includes the Winchesters or Halliwells again  Let me tell you what I conclude  I conclude we will watch this in the hours of the worst boredom for the sole reason of the glorious sarcasm, accent and body of the Prince of Lies and still will be bored while watching  And for Devil's sake, get the angles of firing a gun right!

"Lucifer","2016-02-24"," This is a light hearted show which is well executed to while away an hour  It doesn't stand up to scrutiny too closely but I don't think it's claiming to be anything too deep and doesn't take itself too seriously  Although I should confess that a crush on the lead actor in this show which does slightly compromise my objectivity!It's main draw is Tom Ellis playing the lead with a mixture of suave coolness and quick funny quips that we would all love to deliver but only think of afterwards  He verges on Carry-On British humour at times but seems to be pulling it off  His lady LA cop; Chloe is also a strong character played well and liable which isn't that easy faced with an opposite character that gets all the fun bits  There is lots of humour and things going on that you would love to do if you were immortal and could get away with anything  The script feels well written in terms of conversations and pace  I think the mysteries are a bit simple and luckily each line of enquiry neatly leads into the next one  But as they have just a 45 minutes to solve each mystery satisfactorily, it needs to be fairly uncomplicated  And just enough is given away for viewers to solve it almost at the same time  I watch shows like Murdoch Mysteries and some British mystery shows like Rosemary & Thyme, Father Brown and this is similar in style The difficulty is that I simply don't believe that anyone who isn't police would get near crime scenes, suspects, information, police cells or be let within 100 yards of anything crime related without getting arrested themselves  Bones gets around it as she supports the police  Elementary, because they are private detectives  Agatha Christie heros and heroines because it was all a little less tight in the 1950s  But in the modern day, Lucifer manages to get around everything by being seductive, looking them in the eye and asking people what it is they really desire, momentarily debilitating their rational thought  I personally would certainly fall foul of this approach  But I'm not sure if it washes with viewers who don't feel the same as me about the actor  And I wonder if it will become too repetitive to be used numerous times in every episode eventually  The show appears to be self conscious of this making a joke early on about him not being a Jedi so again, maybe this will still work long term but I'm unsure Having said that, I was intrigued enough to watch the first 3 in a row  And liked the story arcs of him gradually revealing supernatural skills, Chloe investigating these to look for plausible explanations, Chloe's daughter (pleasingly not revoltingly cutesy) and ex-husband, his ongoing puzzlement that Chloe doesn't fall under his spell like everyone else and the fact that God is annoyed and sends an angel messenger with various warnings about what will happen if Lucifer doesn't resume his job in hell  I hope the writers have thought these through & I currently look forward to the next ones  ",8,0.4,8.4,"Positive"

"Lucifer","2016-01-30"," It's good to see Vertigo titles getting green-lit for the small screen, however they tend to have poor ratings or at times their screenwriters were unable to keep to the comics books mythologies  The well-intended Constantine TV series, for example, had its protagonist staying relatively close to its comics book's persona (compared to the Keanu Reeves' movie version)  But alas, that show got canned after lukewarm receptions on its 1st Season  It was a tragic attempt at serializing one of the great graphic literatures for the television NBC's Constantine stayed remarkably close to its comics counterpart, albeit the character's motives and moral compass were adjusted to make him more palatable to the general audience  Similarly, Fox's Lucifer had been turned into a mutated clone of its superior comics version  For instance, in the pilot episode we see Lucifer Morningstar partners up with a detective to solve mundane crimes because he 'cares' about humanity  Then there is the sub-plot involving his growing (dis)affection to the said detective's juvenile daughter  The characterization feels disingenuous, awkward and makes no sense at all  In fact, Fox's Lucifer is a pale facsimile of the truly intriguing character, first created by Neil Gaiman, and later fully fleshed out by Mike Carey  In the comics series you became immersed in the esoteric underworking of the spiritual realms, and even sympathize with the Devil because of you begin to care about his journey and storyline  In the series he stayed true to his evil origin and antagonistic nature towards God  But you begin to understand his struggle and indifference to humanity, as these reflect our own journeys as human beings faced with our daily sufferings and challenges In fact, the character of Lucifer (in the comics) is a reflection of our own foibles and failings as a species Gone were the white clothing, the blonde hair, the elegant and devilishly classy demeanor that made Lucifer character one of the most enduring comics book personalities  It would be interesting to see how the story pans out too, as the consistently well-written Vertigo title lies heavily on its supernatural themes, whereas the TV version seems adamant on making Lucifer as mundane as it gets His classy jazz club had been turned into a strange pub-cum-strip-joint  The mysterious and strong Mazikeen in the TV series became a whiny and lusty bartender  Whilst in the comics, Morningstar couldn't care less about the fate of humanity and would rather spend his days playing the piano and singing in his club, Tom Ellis' portrayal of him is too flamboyant and too eager to care/help humans  He is filled with so much lust and sleaze, that he would make a used-car salesman or a pimp blush I feel that the 42-min pilot had almost no resemblance to its source, except at a superficial level  It is a hollow adaptation that betrays the high quality storytelling that made both Neil Gaiman and Mike Carey's writings great  ",4,-0.4,3.6,"Negative"

The 'cops and robbers' is the backdrop theme and just as the 'cowboys and injuns' backdrop was used to convey countless excellent entertaining stories ranging from the truly gritty to the utterly comical, Lucifer succeeds admirably in conveying a fresh and light-hearted comedic drama that obviously uses the 'cops and robbers' theme as a very general backdrop  Incidentally, what is wrong with having another good 'cop' TV show anyway, or another good 'sci-fi' TV show? Or another 'about anything' good new TV show?

I think this show has a lot of potential and I'm really excited for the episodes that will follow  Also I like the chemistry between Tom Ellis and Lauren German it will be interesting to see where their relationship will go  The show is exactly what I needed: something new, fresh and with a clever and smart dialog! Fantasy, Drama, Comedy a top score for me! ",10,1.3,10,"Positive"
"Lucifer","2015-08-27"," Good story! Flawless acting! Highly entertaining!The only thing that needs a bit of work is the camera-work  Delivering a line while the faces of the interlocutors are totally obscured by their passage in front of the camera is a rookie mistake  Ah, and one other thing: Why is Lucifer so obviously scared (?) of the archangel<U+0085>? It makes him less cool! If these 2 things would be taken care of, it would certainly be a 9  Adding some more philosophy to it, or making the main character more devious (or a combination), would definitely bring it to a 10 All in all, when this comes out, I'll be the first to watch it!

"Lucifer","2015-08-26"," Nonsensical trash  A show about the one being in the universe who would never 'help' humanity 'helping' humanity  I don't know if there is a devil - but if there is he is the inhuman, murky, sinister, malicious incarnation of utter evil - heartless, void of pity, delighting at every infant's death and every cancer patient's cough  And here we see a charming, handsome 'hero' who   Oh, why bother? The world's utter stupidity is just not worth getting into rages over I've had my little say  In my opinion it's like making a movie with Stalin, Mao or Hitler as the hero  ",1,-1,1,"Negative"
"Lucifer","2015-08-23"," For some reason the main character of the comics which was a delightful sarcastic, non-sentimental, sadistic, asexual and determined entity has been transformed into a joker in this pilot(In all honesty the Hellblazer series would have needed this character more than what it has)  What is with all that smile, actual humor, sentiments and an actual drive for sex from Lucifer (Ruler of Hell, and First One to have ever defied God?!?!?) By contrast the only  winged  Angel present seems more evil and determined than the above, which will definitely ignite the Christian communities, cause it actually presents Lucifer as the good guy and everybody else as the misguided flock of good-willing evildoers  That is not what made the comics great and unless the directors are aiming for a Mentalist/Supernatural blend of moonshine this will not go to far  ",3,0,3,"Negative"
"Lucifer","2015-08-20"," First off, I am not a comic reader, and I am coming at this with no preconceptions or bias for or against any previous works on this story line  This said, everyone knows that conversion from written/graphical works to screen (being TV or Movie) often leaves followers of such works disappointed that they have strayed from the  original  story (just keep in mind that this seems to be the case here) Overall, this pilot looks to be the best new concept show in it's class for quite a while  Great comedy, refreshing characters, and a nice twist-break from the classic  Good vs Evil  stories The plot is interesting, if just a tad predictable, but no so much as to put me out on it  The balance of character development is just enough to raise some questions in the viewers mind as to how certain characters revealed in the pilot will mature as the show progresses, but not too much as to over saturate the characters The pilot story leaves future story development wide open, with hints here and there to certain plot keys that may or may not be addressed in the first season  IMHO, this show is much less controversial than the organization(s)  seeking to block it, and I for one am wishing this team the best of luck with their new series  ",10,0.7,10,"Positive"

"Lucifer","2015-08-17"," I thought the show was a hoot - Lucifer shows his imperfection even with his suave, sophisticated accent, he manages to mispronounce Mischievous as 'Mischievious'  It's funny how he actually calls himself Lucifer - I wonder if the name will catch on in the baby naming books - hopefully not  I must admit, when I first saw the title, I was not too sure I liked the idea but in reality - it's a bit of fun, not to be taken too seriously  There's a definite chemistry between Lucifer and his female cop associate but she knows how to handle him well  I think it's an OK show, so far  I guess the next episodes of the series will show if it's a keeper  ",8,-0.1,7.9,"Positive"

"Lucifer","2015-08-15"," THEY have a plan that sounds more or less like this: let's take something with market value, buy the rights, send the whole package at our underground monkey writing lab, spin the story until devoid of any meaningful plot it becomes just another tasteless format  There you go! Now let's tease the fan base with some useless reference to what they love while carefully not scaring our formatted public with anything new or original  At this point the first obvious question would be: why bother? Production companies have hundreds of complete and developed stupid format ideas when it comes to cop shows or hospital shows, you want the single-mum detective? Got it! The drunken rough but wise cop on his road to salvation? Got it! You want the teenager cop who solves crimes in partnership with a ghost? Got it! So? Why ruin good source material to produce an awfully anonymous copy of the very same format? As it happens I have my very own conspiracy theory: they're out to buy and destroy any kind of original piece of writing which now or in the future might pose a threat to the  same-s#itty-idea  global domain, they have agents everywhere, they even start up innocent-looking production companies apparently untied to their secret organisation to acquire TV rights of everything and kill ideas in their cradle  Sounds good?

"Lucifer","2015-08-14"," Wow, What a pilot episode!The pilot has given off a great first impression to what is to come!As played by Tom Ellis, Lucifer is a light-hearted - and sometimes insufferable - prick with a soft side for fallen angels (of the human variety) and sweet young children  There's not much danger to the character Both actors have considerable screen presence but neither are able to fully make their characters anything other than one-dimensional: He's a funny jerk, she's his straight-laced - but not prudish - galpal I suppose there is room for Lucifer to grow; it's unfair to judge the show's potential based on just the first episode as it has given me the impression of a cliché storyline, but this is TV land, where first impressions are crucial and the landscape is always changing in bigger, darker ways For all his notoriety, Lucifer has a lot to prove in this playground, but for a pilot episode, it was certainly a refreshing twist!

"Lucifer","2015-08-13"," I started watching the pilot with great expectations as the title of the show itself seemed pretty intimidating to me  I will draw out later whether I was satisfied or not  I'd like to start with the aspect that impressed me most of all: the soundtracks  All the tracks from the very beginning of the pilot created perfectly suitable atmosphere  In my opinion, soundtracks also successfully serve the purpose of outlining the main character's nature  The plot, alongside with the title of the show, may seem quite provoking to some audiences  However, even though I expected Lucifer to be an absolutely positive character, script writers seem not to have forgotten sadistic nature of the Devil  This earned extra stars for the show from me  However, several plot holes did not let me rate 10/10  What seemed to be the most annoying one for me was the fact that Lucifer knows everything about our pop culture ( Taken  and other movie references, knowing the names of celebrities), however, he seems to be unfamiliar to the way movies are shot (Gray Cooper scene)  Another important aspect I would like to outline is acting, which is, I must say, extraordinary  To sum up, the show lived up to my expectations  Recommendation: watch it!

Writers do not seem to have read any Superhero comics, and do not understand their appeal  Every time Clark Kent / Superman is mentioned, he is put into a bad light (?!!)

"Supergirl","2017-11-05"," I really like this show and believe that it has great potential to go the distance at least to 10 seasons; However, the current story-line for the past two seasons has been to promote LGBT awareness and acceptance to create a genre that bridges all generations on the subject matter  The problem here is that it's being dished out in spades without the consideration of balance and at times taking away focus from the actual story-line of Supergirl  Imagine if every show of Supergirl included a priest citing passages from the Bible and building a story-line that suggests you should go to church every Sunday! Would you accept that has okay and normal? So yes being Gay is your right so is going to church on Sunday, therefore, Please!

"Supergirl","2017-10-31"," The writing for this show just continues to go downhill into Season 3  It's like the writers don't even know what they've written already  For example having Maggie's father commenting about how they want to build a wall  Just stop with the constant Donald Trump jabs already  I'm as liberal and progressive as they come, but even I find the constant political garbs off putting and unnecessary  It's sort of like in the debacle that was Season 2 where they had Kara tell Mon El that maybe being Supergirl and being with him was enough when in Season 1 she told J'Onn that being Kara Danvers and having her job at CatCo was just as important to her as her Supergirl duties when he offered her to work full time at the DEO  Do these writers have existing story line amnesia or something?What I'm really irritated with is the show's handling of Sanvers  These writers and show runners knew from the start how invested the LGBTQ community would get in Sanvers, especially after giving Alex such an honest coming out story  But unfortunately, they completely botched Sanvers with a rushed, barely fleshed out story line with minimal screen time   then gave them an unrealistic engagement at the end of Season 2  Now in Season 3 we have to believe that they are going to break up over Alex suddenly deciding becoming a mother is more important that being with Maggie? Really? It's OOC writing and and insult to the healthy LGBTQ relationship they were trying to portray to us  Look, I understand the show shouldn't be relationship drama heavy, and I agree  But these writers are the ones who keep insisting it be shoved in everywhere   and they can't even write a decent relationship to save their lives!I'm officially ditching Supergirl  I'm not here to watch them tear apart one of the few positive LGBTQ relationships that are out there right now  And I'm definitely not here to watch Kara be all moody after Mon El's exit only to have the childish dude bro return in a few episodes anyway  It's gross  Supergirl is gross   a gross train-wreck  ",1,0,1,"Negative"

I liked Season 1 of Supergirl  Given its cheesy moments at times, Kara was an empowering character as she was coming into her own as a superhero  And Alex  Alex was actually my favorite female character  What was great about Season 1, for me, was that there were so many amazing, strong female characters, which is rare for television these days  Then Season 2 came around  I don't even want to get into how awful that season was with Kara taking a back seat to Mon El's story while having to watch her eventually hook up with him and become a side character in her own show  Plenty of other reviews have voiced their disdain for that disrespectful frat boy better than I ever could  I did love the addition of Lena Luthor and Alex's coming out story line  Fast forward to what we've endured so far in Season 3   Mon El is still somehow mentioned in every episode even though he's gone  Tech genius and all around bad ass Lena Luthor has given up LCorp so she can run CatCo   a company she knows nothing about and let's be honest   is a step down from being a female CEO at a tech company   an industry consisting mostly of men  Maggie is still only  Alex's girlfriend  and now Alex is suddenly obsessed with having children, (And has been grossly OOC this season) which is going to be the demise of Sanvers   one of the few healthy, positive w/w relationships on screen right now  Not to mention the writers can't even remember their own story lines and are making it up as they go along so they can get in as many jabs at Trump as they possibly can  (They're building a wall?) Really, because last time I checked, in the Supergirl world, Trump wasn't president  The only thing worth sticking around for at this point is the Sam/Reign story line  But I don't think it's worth enduring the rest of the dumpster fire writing that is continuing to plague this show  Sorry to say, I'm done with Supergirl  Which is sad, because I love the SG comics  And I was hoping we'd finally get great representation in a female superhero  Well, I was wrong  Guess I'm going to have to look elsewhere  ",1,0.2,1.2,"Negative"

Only this time around we (adolescent-/adults), have selfishly robbed our children of this precious gift, replacing it with disposable characters, media and toys, we have grossly twisted the ~essence~ of comic book superheroes out of context and why they were created in the first place to suit our own insatiable appetites for entertainment, nostalgia and greed --you don't have to look far into the comments and reviews to see it Having said that, I LOVE this show for the exact same reasons that people hate it It has kid-friendly dialogue and story lines which are easy to follow, portraying 'realistic' challenges faced by the female protagonist   packed with a healthy dose of good old- fashioned girl power (feminism?!, my left t*t!)

Talk about being out of touch with just how much Mon-El was disliked as a character  It's no secret that I despise Mon-El's character  The way the writers continually allowed Kara to be berated and disrespected by him was very offensive and not at all what the Kara from Season 1 would have put up with, especially if she had still been with James  Speaking of James   an overly glossed over point it seems is how they abruptly did away with the Kara and James relationship for no apparent reason and then immediately had her get with a white boy who used to own slaves  So   apparently the writers also don't have a problem with slavery and the racist undertones that had  Just another lovely tidbit   which I see other fellow reviewers have also commented on  The  right story to tell  also involved Mon-El telling Winn after Kara still wouldn't get with him that he missed being on Daxam where he could objectify women and just not care  THAT'S they kind of character you want representing your show? Well guess what, that's not what I want to watch  And I won't be tuning in for Season 3  Oh, and the endless political propaganda that I spoke of in the title, that pretty much speaks for itself in most of Season 2  I have no party affiliation  It was just annoying to be continually beaten over the head with the writers' political views  The CW's version of Supergirl is not something to be proud of   unless the writers, producers, and network executives are proud of propping up a horribly written male character that undermined the leading female character and essentially took over her show  If that's that what they were going for, then kudos to them for turning what could have been an empowering, strong female character into an unrecognizable, shell of a girl who is by no means any kind of super heroine I'd want to look to for inspiration as a woman And I'll just leave it at that, because if I get started on the lazy writing and major plot holes that never got resolved, this review will become a novel!

"Supergirl","2017-08-01"," I gave the show 2 stars instead of 1 because I did enjoy Season 1  I've never been a fan of comic book television or films, but I gave Supergirl a shot since we rarely see female led shows   let alone a female-driven superhero show  So I was pleasantly surprised by the first season  It wasn't perfect by any means  But it was enjoyable to watch and had plenty of strong women from Supergirl herself to her sister Alex to Lucy Lane and the  Queen of all Media,  Cat Grant  Where Supergirl went horribly wrong was in Season 2  From inconsistent writing with way too many plot holes (even for a superhero show) to the majorly problematic character of Mon-El  In fact, Mon-El is why I won't be watching Season 3  Because you see, after all of the backlash from fans and even countless articles done by entertainment media outlets outright stating that Supergirl's problem was too much Mon-El, the show-runners are blatantly ignoring that and bringing him back for Season 3  And let me guess   they are going to tout him as a newly changed man and a  hero   I wasn't watching Supergirl because I wanted a misogynistic douche-bag of a dude-bro not only taking over the show that's supposed to be about Kara, but also reducing Kara to being his love interest  So   what was the problem with Mon-El, one might ask? Well, we could start off with how he missed objectifying women back on his home planet because he was irritated that Kara didn't want to get with him  And that came after he'd already been disrespectful to her on countless occasions  Kara told him on numerous occasions that they weren't a good match, but he kept pursing her and eventually tried to guilt her into not liking him back by throwing out an I love you  And when they did eventually get together (because this is the CW and of course the lead female can't be without a guy), seconds after she asked him to keep their relationship on the down-low, he announced to the whole DEO that they were together, which was just   gross, not to mention highly disrespectful of Kara's wishes  We were told on numerous occasions that Mon-El had changed, but were never shown it  He fixed Kara breakfast and that apparently warranted him being a  changed man   Wow   the expectations are very low with this one, I tell ya  And by the end of the season, even though he kept telling anyone who would listen that he was also a hero, it was Kara that had to tell him to  go be a hero   There a countless more situations I could discuss, but the point of the matter here is that Kara was reduced to being the love interest in her own show  And we could get into how the writers decided to break up Kara and James before they even had a chance at a relationship and then replaced James with a boring, sexist white guy who also owned slaves   seriously, ya can't make this up  I was thrilled to hear that Katie McGrath was going to be in Season 3 as a regular, because I loved Lena Luthor's character  In fact, she was the only good thing about Season 2, to be completely honest  But unfortunately, not even Ms  McGrath can get me to watch again when they intend to bring Mon-El back and pretend like there was absolutely nothing wrong with the way his character was written  If you're looking to feel inspired by strong women, Supergirl is not the show for you  I'd recommend  Wynonna Earp,   Orphan Black,  and even a new show called  The Bold Type  instead  Save yourself the frustration of seeing Supergirl/Kara fall by the wayside so that a good for nothing frat boy could take the lead and destroy anything good the show had going for it  ",2,0.1,2.1,"Negative"
"Supergirl","2017-08-01"," I really enjoyed Season 1 of Supergirl  Sure, it had its flaws  But overall it was empowering and had plenty of strong, female characters, which is something we don't get so see a lot of all in one show  Then Season 2 happened  And I had to watch as a spoiled, self- entitled, sexist frat boy not only take over the show, but also get to be Kara's love interest  And sadly, his character pretty much took over the show  Not only did Mon-El disrespect Kara on numerous occasions (sometimes in front of her co-workers), but he was full of sexist gibes  The writers literally had him say that he missed objectifying women and not caring when he was on Daxam  How do you have the nerve to tout your show as feminist and empowering when the main character's love interest is saying things like that? It was appalling  The only saving grace of Season 2 was Katie McGrath's Lena Luthor  And I was going to stick around for Season 3 for her even though I knew they were going to bring Mon-El back despite the majority of the fandom and countless media outlets called out the show for having a Mon-El problem  But after the cast mocked a part of the fandom that shipped Lena and Kara together, it's clear they think too highly of themselves and do not respect the fans  So I won't be watching Season 3  And after the messy debacle that was Season 2, I'd say I'm much better off finding a show that appreciates its fans and also doesn't insult female viewers by claiming to be empowering when we had to watch our female heroine get put down time and time again by a toxic male character while trying to tell us that he'd changed and Kara made him a better man  Because one   he didn't change  And two   it's not a woman's job to make a man better  So I'd say watch this show at your own risk  Or just skip it all together  There are plenty of other shows out there where the cast appreciates and validates their fans and where female characters are allowed to be strong and heroic without having to deal with sexist, disrespectful supporting characters!

There were some quirks that got on my nerves (like everyone constantly referring to Clark Kent as her cousin and reminding us every five minutes that Kara is a female   ), but for the most part, I thought it was done pretty well! Then season two came around    And everything went downhill  Just to start eith, there's the overuse of the name  Supergirl  (like, Kara refers to herself in third person), all the relationship drama, everything being overly  pc -- and the political agendas,references, and undertones (they LOVE the words  alien  and  refugee  and even tie them in to political story lines)  A little but of that goes a long way  ",6,0.3,6.3,"Positive"

Okay I get it Then why do they have to be related and from the same planet?Wonder woman is an Amazon brought to life by Zeus the god of thunder  Just an example Why why why    Yeah okay so this is what we have now so let's examine what we got We have a 13 year old teenage blondie dropped on to our earth from wonderland who's more of the time crying, complaining or just wondering herself while waving her hands all over the place  This little girl is so confused about everything that she needs to remind herself that she is a girl and that it is awesome that she is a girl and a super at that a superGIRL! No not a boy or a man but a GIRL!I mean if the show was called  The blondie in pink pyjamas with powers  only then I would need this information to know what to call her   Well her name is Kara but I guess she remembers that cause shes not repeating:  I'm Kara    Okay so this Kara was suppose to be more powerful than her cousin the Superman himself what I understood and boy have I ever been more misled and deceived! She get's her ass handed to her like all the time  There even was a scene where she willingly let a normal human being put a suicide helmet on her head and suck her dry of powers out of no reason at all  So shes also stupid I have no idea what this piece of dirty and smelly sewer water of a series is doing representing the DC universe  A relative to the man of steel Let's say in the world of TV series the Daredevil is an absolute masterpiece in characters, story, fighting and world I must add that when Jimmy Olson changed in to the Guardian in supergirl  That was the finest moment of the whole series  But I predicted that they can't keep the guardian cause he would stomp over supergirl so hard that the name would have to be changed so Supergirl instructed that the Guardian can't co exist in her candy land of pink cakes and flowers and nail polish  Yeah I know   Girls won't share and girls don't play it fare  Arrow and Flash have got their own teams and sometimes even they share the same enemies  But this stubborn little girl with blue laser eyes more wet than blazing all the time want's to lead without any confidence in herself  No this isn't Diana, not the Black widow or canary, not the Catwoman not Talia but just a lost girl without cause living in the city of the man of steel  What a pity cause a cousin of the Man of steel could of had some juice in the making only this is made for children The fighting is awful just throwing always throwing someone on the wall or through or almost  The CgI looks awful Man of steel -> Dawn of justice -> wonder woman -> Justice league -> supergirl!!!

"Supergirl","2017-06-18"," Yes, I get it: If you're an American conservative, you're going to hate this show  And if you aren't open to changing your mind about anything, you shouldn't even watch it And, although the agenda being pushed unsubtly by the show is definitely on the liberal end of the American political spectrum, most of it would be considered mainstream in the rest of the free world  Feminism, normalization of homosexual relations, climate change, gun control, immigration, and even some sly digs at Donald Trump, are all there  But note that several of the bad guys are actually extremist environmentalists I suspect that much of the criticism of other aspects of the show: the dialogue, the acting, the plots, even the fight scenes, is caused by the reverse-halo effect, whereby, something one finds undesirable causes one to see only flaws everywhere else Personally, I found the dialog, especially the banter between the characters, believable, but not to the point of being too obvious or stereotyped  However, I concede that in the more serious intimate scenes, there did seem to be rather too much of  I believe in you ,  You need to believe in yourself , etc , and also an unrealistic emphasis on characters lives being totally dedicated to the  protection  of other ones  Why anyone would  protect  another character by recruiting them into one of the most dangerous jobs on the planet is beyond me! As is why characters invulnerable to practically anything except Kryptonite would need especial protection  I found the acting to be good; in fact, I didn't even notice the acting most of the time: generally a good sign  The only character who didn't work for me was Superman: maybe the acting, maybe the casting, maybe just his appearance, didn't work for me It was interesting to see some  bad guys  with noble agendas, not just out for world domination or revenge  This led to some genuine debate between the characters Melissa Benoist is cute, funny, likable, and surprisingly vulnerable emotionally, and anchors the show very watchably The frequent cases where ties of family and friendship led to violations of national security, apparently without penalty, were particularly unrealistic; but the whole show demands considerable suspension of disbelief anyway Some have criticized the misandry (man-hatred) of the show  I think this is hard to support: there are several very strong, highly admirable, male characters  Also, there are far more cruel, ruthless female characters than male ones  As a father, myself, I do sometimes find the portrayal on TV of fathers, to be outrageous  This seems to happen mainly in animated shows for children: examples include 'Fairly Oddparents', 'The Amazing World of Gumball', and 'Johnny Test'  At the worst, the Dad is lazy, feckless, and severely morally compromised, while the Mom is the opposite  'The Simpsons' is like this too, but the intelligence and wit of the show just-about make up for this  However, I felt no such outrage at the portrayal of men in 'Supergirl' Some have said that every character is judged by how they relate to Supergirl  In fact, she is not shown as perfect: in one scene, when her own moral compass is compromised, it takes a male character to show her what she should do  There are other scenes where a steadying male character has to overrule an over-emotional and out-of-control female one Some have criticized differences from the original comic books  At the age of 9, I was an avid reader of DC's 'Superman', 'Action', and 'Adventure' comics, spending all my meager weekly allowance on them  I was not so much a follower of Supergirl, but I'm very familiar with the Jimmy Olsen figure  But, you know what? This is a reboot: it's dragging the characters over 50 years forward in time: there was no internet, blogging, or cell phones, in those days  Just don't think of 21st Century James Olsen as the same as 20th Century Jimmy Olsen  Also, the many references to real-life people, although repeated to the point of self-parody, serve to anchor the show firmly in the 20-teens I was surprised at the number of vulnerabilities the Girl of Steel supposedly has: ones that I don't remember from the comics; but in a series this long, if she can't be hurt by anything other than Kryptonite, then in order to maintain the dramatic tension without being tiresomely repetitive, there have to be several ways to hurt or limit her There's a huge amount of hand-to-hand combat, with the frequent cliché of a character being slammed into something massive and destroying it I will say that the rapid sequence of love-interests was rather unrealistic, and frustrating; and the reason given for cutting some of them off bizarre:  The Universe seems to be telling us something  I didn't like the way some episodes ended with  to be continued on 'The Flash' , as Netflix didn't provide that continuity  This may explain why a serious rift between two characters was entirely mended by the start of the next one I started overhearing the show as my 12-year-old binge-watched it, then I watched some of the later episodes with him  After that, I was hooked, and at the time of writing, I've seen almost all of them Added 7/5/2017: It seems three people found this review unhelpful: Since I advised conservatives not to watch the show, I guess they must be conservatives who liked the show, after all  ",8,-0.4,7.6,"Positive"

"Supergirl","2017-06-14"," This show made me shiver out of the awkwardness of the script  At first, I became incredibly bored with the show and turned it off after the second episode, forgetting whatever second chances I had in mind for this show  Until my sister began to watch it again and I had no choice but to watch it with her  Everyone seems to think 'oh, it gets worse,' and by season 2, it does get much worse  Much, much worse  Even the cliffhangers, like the woman who owns that anti-alien group that I can't spell captures Mon-El and Supergirl, all I thought was 'lame' and 'really, this is the best cliffhanger you could do?' so I am still watching it, but don't expect anything too spectacular off of this show, because you aren't going to get much enjoyment out of it  Even the so-called suspense is blunt and boring  Sure, it makes you think what happens next, but does it really make your heart race, wondering what will happen to the protagonist? Or does it have great twists that you never saw coming that made the movie,  The Dark Knight  so great? Surely some of these new shows that are made should know that great twists are what people are looking for nowadays! This show is so predictable, I could see the twist that Mon-El was the prince practically a mile away! And the script, I constantly know what everyone will say next  This is just because of the writers and directors in this part, but they are so set on the heroes having mercy for the antagonists that they let them live and never kill them  But, they have left out a crucial element to this show: the human nature does not always have mercy  If they wanted the script and the story to at least be a little more realistic, having some of the antagonists killed more often  In the beginning they did that more often, and had Astrid, Supergirl's aunt killed, but besides that, there aren't really that many more antagonists killed  But what I really, really, really hate the most about this show, is that they let the character Cat Grant leave for a long period of time  She was my favorite character, being that woman who plays tough but is really a softy on the inside  She was probably the only thing that kept me watching the show! When she left, the show got quite tedious to me The 2nd to last episode of season 2 Cat Grant comes back, but for that long time period when she was gone, Supergirl probably lost some significant viewers  So, overall, this show deserves a 5 out of ten, because it is simply too boring to make people wonder what happens next and gets more boring the more you watch  ",5,-0.8,4.2,"Negative"

Yes, let us welcome all failed ideologies, Nazism, Communism, Extreme Islamism, and of course, now,  progressivism  In other words, let's let all the terrorists in, try to love them more and that will make them not kill us, because love wins    Then we have the sexist approach that suggests that actually women are not equal to men, but in fact superior and I don't mean supergirl and her powers  No, I mean every woman in the show out thinks and outsmarts the  guys  exponentially ( the term is in quotation because every male actually is competing in who will be the most feminine and therefore easiest accepted by feminist viewers, no one really behaves like a man ) After those lost 20 minutes of my life, I will never watch again, in hopes you will not either  ",1,0.3,1.3,"Negative"

"Supergirl","2017-06-01"," I thought the first season of Supergirl got better as it went on which in the end got me pretty excited for this season  But this season in my opinion fails to deliver and is a disappointing second season  The premise of the season sees kara attempting to help aliens live on earth without getting prosecuted by humans and other aliens  Melissa Benoit plays Supergirl in this show and I thought she did an alright job, at times she brings a lot of depth to the character especially to the dramatic parts of the season  However, especially at the beginning part of the season I found her actually quite irritating and annoying as she acted better then everybody else and it was really hard to care about her  There is a large supporting cast with a couple of standouts, first of all was Chris wood as Mon el, I really found him fun to watch and I really did like his character progression throughout the season  I thought him and Benoit had really good chemistry this season as well as I cared about there dynamic for sure  Alex danvers was a pretty decent character in the first season but she really shines this season as I really did care about her personal discovery this season and found it one of the more fascinating parts of the season  However, I found most of the other characters annoying, winn and James side story was pretty dull and felt really tacked on which felt tacked on  For the first half is the season the show focuses on Cadmus and the luthors and I found both of them particularly uninteresting  The story has some decent drama to it especially with some of the dynamics between a few of the relationships that i did like  However, the overall villain plot of this show is very weak and not interesting, there is nothing particular that stands out and makes you care about it  The script again has some decent dramatic dialogue in it as mentioned before which helps build the relationships  The humour last season was very cheesy and it really didn't improve enough to take it seriously as a fun show  The style of the show does have some spectacle to it and I did like seeing the grand nature of the show  However, similar to last season I found some of the action scenes as very by the numbers and this season doesn't improve and even regresses a bit  Overall this show isn't particularly interesting and the thing that keeps me interested is the fact that this show is in the same universe as other better shows but Supergirl really needs to improve to keep me on board for season 3  ",5,1.1,6.1,"Positive"
"Supergirl","2017-05-28"," The show has its merits  Supergirl battles bad people  But, I think the writers miss the point about Supergirl  She is older than Superman, smarter than Superman, wiser than Superman and has a full handle on her Kryptonian powers  The fact that she looks younger than Superman is a bonus due to her 17 years in the pod while traveling to Earth  She came to earth to  protect  her younger cousin  Even though she looks young, she is far older, when she puts on her costume  At her best Supergirl is a warrior, at worst a warrior mom  But, Hey, its TV  I believe  Cat Grant  is the real star of the show because she exhibits the maturity that Supergirl should have  On the other hand Superman is just a lisp away from being flaming  Way to go Hollywood!!

Besides feminism doesn't mean women are better than men, it means they should be treated equally, and what's wrong with that? Welcome to the 21st century where women can do anything a man can, including leading a superhero TV series  This show represents that notion very well without beating you over the head with it  Melissa Benoist is an awesome Supergirl and the relationship she has with the supporting characters really make this show worth watching, especially her relationship with her sister played by Chyler Leigh  This is the Superman show we always deserved because it's much better than Smallville, but it just happens to be led by a woman, which is awesome  If you're a woman hating piece of garbage then you won't like it, but frankly nobody cares what you think  If you're looking for something fun, that doesn't take itself too seriously and has a wonderful cast of characters, then I'd recommend giving it a shot  ",8,1,9,"Positive"

"Supergirl","2017-02-19"," It started a bit slow and clichéd  But it got better with the episodes  Kara is growing not only as Supergirl but also as a person  And I really like also the other women in the show both good and bad  In fact I like there are so many women even in the extras or just mentioned, like the POTUS is a she  Many of the other comments with one * are spitting venom because of all the women, I find it refreshing  And     this Martian Manhunter is really good in both forms  :) What I don't like is that Supergirl is not that super in many occasions for dramatic reasons  For example she is supposed to be as fast as the Flash but when 3 people jump off a building she can only save two  Compared to Alex, her sister, is more of a  hero  going beyond her own capabilities quite often to save Supergirl  Season 2 starts with many changes, looking forward to see how it evolves  ",7,0.7,7.7,"Positive"
"Supergirl","2017-02-17"," It has been enjoyable following Supergirl's journey as she tries to manage her newfound persona and responsibilities, her relationships and her homesickness  HOWEVER, It feels like the writers have been slowly changing the indestructible woman into a walking, flying bundle of insecurities: - SPOILER ALERT -* RELATIONSHIP WITH SISTER: Whereas it is wonderful to see the  us against the world  spirit and recognize its roots in Kara's loss of family and the love that binds her to her earthly family, her sulking over her sister going to a concert with her own new girlfriend, thus blowing Kara's Earth-birthday plans (which she hadn't bothered to share with anyone, mind you!) struck me as rather childish  This is a woman who lost her home planet and has had to live through the hardships of making a life on Earth! She ought to handle disappointments better than a 3 year old * ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS: Whether with James and recently with Mon- El, there's this  I want it - No, I don't want it - I like you a lot - No we can't be together  back and forth to her romantic interests that will give you whiplash  Sure, it's understandable that being an indestructible crime-fighting alien who's only been on Earth for a decade or so, may make romantic relationships complicated; but that's not what comes out at all: they've made her into a woman who can't make her mind up on what she wants, if anything out of these relationships Same thing actually happened with Alex who literally broke up and got back together with her girlfriend twice in an episode  Same thing happened again with J'onn and M'gann  * DISCONTINUITIES: The writers seem to be just as unsure about story lines as Kara is about her relationships: Is Mon-El a superhero in training or was that just to shoehorn in another romantic dead end for Kara? Whatever happened to Lucy Lane and her father? They were super involved in 1st season  Haven't heard from them since!* THE DISGUISE: Really, the difference between Kara and Supergirl are the glasses and the cape  Honestly, the fact that those around her haven't clued in, especially the super-shrewd Ms Grant defies even the suspension of belief you need to enter a DC Universe - CONCLUSION: It is wonderful that we are getting female superheroes, but rather infuriating that they can't be made into more than naive self-doubting bombshells, that only win every fight because the script says so  I'm sticking with the show, because I believe it really has some potential  I just hope the writers are able to explore the themes of alienation, responsibility, alter-egos and relationships in a way that rewards the viewers, especially female viewers, because I believe, worse than not being represented in the TV superhero pantheon, is being given a character that embodies all the not so flattering female stereotypes  ",7,0,7,"Positive"

"Supergirl","2017-02-03"," I felt the need to write this review to counteract some of the sexist crap that has been posted previously  This show, yes, can be a bit cheesy  But what show based on a comic isn't? What I find special about this series is it's willingness to show us that heroes are born female as well  But let me explain- this is in no way SAYING that men can't be good heroes and women are better than men  No, it's trying to show us the subtlety of the struggle a lot of women face when trying to make a name for themselves, and the lack of strong female role models we have growing up  Supergirl has always lived in her cousin Superman's shadow, finally realizing its okay to come into herself  And the Melissa Beloist who plays Supergirl is PHENOMENAL in the role  She feels so authentic, and is so relatable as the quirky yet fierce Kara Danvers  She shows us that it is okay to make a name for yourself, have strong female role models like her boss Cat, and have a loving relationship with your family while still being strong  I appreciate that a lot  I don't think there is anything in this show that promotes this  feminist agenda  people have been so harshly degrading it for  Yes, feminism is present as feminism simply means equality of opportunity  But what's feminist about it is Supergirl's journey to find herself separate from Superman's shadow, having a female boss who has power and understands how to use it, and having a sister who is as rugged and strong as the male-dominated field of national security that she works for  Supergirl is nothing without her team of friends to help her, showing that its not being female that makes her strong, its being able to accept help from others and find role models in men as well as women  I love this show and I think it deserves a chance  There aren't many out there like this that are willing to put their ratings on the line to give little girls an opportunity to see that you can be a woman and save the world  ",9,0.6,9.6,"Positive"

No, it's not  Watching it won't add anything to your life but on the opposite side, it won't take anything away either The premise is interesting, and there aren't any Women led superhero shows so you have to take what you can get It's not that it's so bad it's mind numbing  It could just be they are trying to be a basic show, but it starts off not making sense  *spoilers* Kara reveals she's an alien to a friend in the first episode because reasons  There was nothing pressing her, she just needed validation  I guess this makes her more human, but it also makes her a fool  The actual human heroes don't do this why does she? Then again, in episode 5 when trying to dispose of a bomb, she flies through the city instead of diagonally up and away from the city  So perhaps her characters is supposed to be a little    slow  But why does the woman hero have to be slow?As far as small problems, the show just introduces things and forgets about it  Like they will show the DEO posing as FBI one episode, and Kara being completely surprised by this the next, there being a mad bomber identified and his ex-boss (who is supposed to be a genius) walking right by him (not in disguise) but Kara's friend notices him from a far (there's more to this that makes even less sense), not to mention how the bomber go through security, the martian man hunter not using his powers effectively when he should or telling transparent lies the characters can easily check but he's oblivious, or the presence of other Kryptonians that have been on earth a while, but didn't go after Kara immediately nor can they easily handle her adult self in battle in spite of it being established that Kara isn't a good fighter  Or even robots going crazy for no reason loosing pieces of themselves that magically appear in the next scene because the doctor went crazy  *spoilers end* Just seems like lazy writing  The show is better than nothing and I'll continue to watch in hopes it'll get better  As long as you don't notice the little things then this is a great show  While I know there are many flaws in all shows, I don't care for them when they are this glaring  like when they are this glaring  ",5,0.2,5.2,"Negative"

As they did in the later superman movies they seriously botched the costume  Supergirl's costume was sexy, this one is not  Seriously, black silk stockings and boots to the mid thigh? Further,she is not blonde as Supergirl is  Plus, she is a total wimp  I watched in dismay as a human punched her and knocked her down  I was equally dismayed when a crook grabbed a hostage and put a gun to their head while Supergirl stood ten feet away  She surrendered! Seriously, the character I am familiar with could have disarmed ten bad guys before any of them could pull the trigger, let alone one bad guy  The special effects are very good in my opinion  The best flying sequences for television I have seen to date  The settings are lavish and detailed  So it's not all bad  Thus the 4 out of ten rating And now she has a    gay sister    who is more capable than Supergirl herself as she has rescued her several times? And they both work for a  Martian?  Jimmy (James) Olsen is a masked avenger??? The same Jimmy Olsen who wore a specially made watch to signal Superman when he was in trouble? I think if you are going to make a series that follows an established story, by all means use creativity, But don't shred the original character for your own stories  Perhaps create your own character and put her in a world infested with aliens and dozens of surviving Kryptonians, put her in another dimension or another setting of some sort, but don't make her abilities change unless you have good reason to for the sake of the setting  People are drawn to the character as she is  Why else make a series about her? They made the same mistake with Smallville  For the first five to six years it was excellent as they stayed true to Superman, but then what happened to Superboy? As we all know, Superman went to his Fortress of Solitude right out of high school and stayed there for 12 years  Suffice to say the creators of Supergirl need to rethink what they are doing and get back on the  Super  track I really don't mind the women's equality plug and the gay rights is OK to, but I don't think it should dominate the story to the point that it does  I know today's trend is toward  Girl  power and  Gay  power  So be it  My opinion is that they don't need to dwell on being politically correct to tell an entertaining story  And that's why the  super  fans watch the shows, read the comics, and spend millions at the movies, to be entertained  Final word, watch a few episodes and see if you agree, I'm finished with it  ",4,0.5,4.5,"Negative"

"Supergirl","2016-12-27"," The best propaganda pieces all have one thing in common: the colors of its country's flag, claiming to be for patriotism, for America, even for world peace sometimes, in order to get its infantilized idea across, despite it being perceived as crazy by its target country, making no attempt to grow an audience of critical thinkers  I once said to an entertainer,  if you're gonna be wrong, at least be funny, Kevin  (I wonder if he actually read the message)  Likewise, I want to tell the Feminist writers for Supergirl, that if you're gonna be wrong, at least be entertaining  Because Feminism is a dead-wrong idea- as many religions are  But feminist writers have created/taken part in amazing works of arts before:  Who Shot Johnny? ,  Jessica Jones ,  Mad Max: Fury Road , all beautiful creations I've read and watched twice  So is Supergirl wrong for having Feminist ideals in it? Nope  It was bad because:It was too friggin PREACHY!! You know how annoying and boring that gets?!?! It's free to keep its worldview of progressivism, but to just talk about it at random points without giving any good reason why   buzzwording, word vomit, pandering, virtue signaling, whatever, it's uncreative and therefore becomes BORING, which is the greatest sin a writer can commit  It doesn't matter if it's a show aimed at kids  They're kids, not idiots  Dr  Seuss is famous because he wrote messages that challenged both children and parents alike, while being under the guise of being a plain children's author  But writers nowadays only care about what SELLS easier more than what is GOOD, sometimes confusing the two as the same thing  CBS didn't pick up the character because she's actually good (she can be), they picked it up because there was a demand for a female feminist superhero, and Wonder Woman wasn't available (anymore)  Supergirl has always been moldable  The viewing audience don't like her because she's good, it's because it's easy for women to fit into her shows (a blank slate, like Hannah Montana) and be as good as the big boys, all on a character that sports American colors, making it justifiable to boil down political/social issues into meaningless one-liners  Example:  She can't beat him    Why, because she's a girl?  If by girl they meant 22-year-old with the mind of an adolescent, then yes  And sure, comedy is subjective   it was just never clever  The action was good until it became predictable  The older sister got lucky too many times, she should've been dead at episode 3  The plot was going somewhere good halfway through, then it just became a meaningless rehash of better show plots  Not much critical character examination  Way too much talk about meaningless romances  Character motivation wasn't always explained  Did they really have to make her appear great just because she was surrounded by weak people?I thought there were great moments in this show, *(spoiler alert): like when she was human for a day and at the risk of her life she convinced a robber to give her his gun  That was well-thought out *Finale was mediocre  She didn't seem to care much for her Uncle, if that's where the struggle was Maybe they did have a heart set on Supergirl   but they just treated even their target audience as stupid children who were gasping for self-esteem like they were running out of oxygen   You can do it, because you just can!

I watched as Suppergirl just stood by and watched a switch thrown in this last episode, the one used to activate the killing weapon  Just stood there as if she couldn't move  This is just bad writing, you writers  Super- speed, get it? She could have been there before that switch was thrown easily  Think of how the Kryptonians moved in  Man of Steel,  or  Smallville   That's how Supergirl should move  Her reflexes match that  It's almost impossible to take any Earth-resident Kryptonian by surprise  So get with it  There are other plot devices which would be infinitely more interesting if writers just dealt with the character's powers instead of hobbling her this way  And, yes, this is written immaturely and unprofessionally  You don't have to write down to kids in the audience  They appreciate the mote intelligent story lines, so give it to 'em and save everybody the pain of watching these episodes  ",4,0.2,4.2,"Negative"

An out-of-place scene that looked to have been conveniently stuck within the episode (at the end?)  It seemed to have been shot BEFORE any of 'The Flash' episodes this season  Uggh! So everyone sat through the entire episode? You mean little kids and teenagers whose parents aren't watching all of the lesbianism/out-of-closet/two-women-kissing scenes were subjected to that CRAPOLA? Really, CW? Luckily I was in the room and changed channels when the lesbianism poured through the screen! Yes, the CW decided that the series was not even worth the effort that it put 1 1/2 minute  cross-over  at the very end of the 'Supergirl' episode! That's right, ratings must be SO BAD that lesbianism for nearly 10 WHOLE MINUTES was MORE IMPORTANT for ratings than anything else!

It isn't stealing from the fun factor at all and her reason for deciding to use her powers for the first time in years was valid and the reason she kept doing it was because of the rush she got from helping people Her reason for helping people is self gratifying, no doubt, but with all that risk and no reward I would at least want to feel good about doing it and when she fails on more than one occasion due to a lack of experience she does feel bad about it The best character has to be Cat Grant, her bitchy but wise personality is perfectly written (thought not always expertly acted) and when she does be a little nasty she isn't doing it to be mean but to encourage self improvement in Kara's human life and by god thank you for making her wise without being all knowing Jimmy Olsen however is a hit and miss, yes he's black when Jimmy is white but he's also just there for no reason except to be the Superman guy without including more major characters from the Superman franchise who would potentially steal the show  Even Quinn has a role with the group but all Jimmy has done is drop Superman franchise names and give advice  He isn't necessary yet but at least he isn't badly written All in all I missed the cheesy Monster (or Alien) of the Week trope because lately it's been about dark tones with lots, if not excessive amounts, of gore It isn't amazing but it's fun and Season 2 is, so far, better than Season 1    ",7,0.1,7.1,"Positive"

"Supergirl","2016-11-21"," This series caught my attention from two sources: one, from some of my own students, and two, from the negative reviews here about ''feminist propaganda'' that none of my students even mentioned  So here's my take: Yes, this is a TV show aimed at kids in their pre-teens or early teens  As such, it doesn't make sense to compare it to series such as Black Mirror or Sense8  It does, however, compare VERY well to similar shows, such as The Flash or Arrow  In fact, I think it's a great show for both boys and girls  There was not a single moment where I felt there was some sort of subversive feminist propaganda that some reviewers here mentioned so vehemently  I would even say that there wasn't enough of this so-called propaganda  Do some guys here have so little self-esteem that they feel threatened by a ''chick flick'' aimed at young teens? I think they should be more worried about shows like The Walking Dead (which I like, by the way) It's great that we now have a superheroine to offset the abundance of superheroes  I say, ''Make more of these!''

It is not too late to save this series - I love the actors when they aren't spewing the DNC talking points or making far reaching comparisons to make a political point?

"Supergirl","2016-11-19"," Now starting its second season on The CW, Supergirl is one of my favourite shows  Its chief strength is Melissa Benoist as Kara Danvers aka Supergirl  I found her kind of annoying when she was on Glee (although she has a terrific singing voice) but Supergirl is perfect for her  Benoist imbues the character with a dorky adorable charm, yet also sells the action scenes A big strength of the first season turned out to be Calista Flockhart as Cat Grant, whose snarky wit yet ultimately decent heart turned out to be a winning combination  The relationship between Cat and Kara (and Cat and Supergirl!) was really well handled All of the supporting characters are charming and likable - although I still don't think they have done enough to make James Olsen anything more than eye candy yet  His upcoming season 2 story line as vigilante The Guardian isn't filling me with confidence Chyler Leigh as Alex Danvers is high on my list of favourites, and the bond between the Danvers sisters is the real heart of the show  Leigh and Benoist work well together Early episodes did show one of the ongoing weaknesses - and one common to the Berlanti verse DC shows and that is bringing in a villain for a episode, only for them to be defeated without leaving much of an impression  There have been a few duds on Supergirl too, and the ongoing season 1 arc with the Fort Ross aliens, Myriad and Astra and Non was only partially successful  (I miss Astra and Laura Benanti!) Already, Brenda Strong as the mysterious Doctor from Project Cadmus is shaping up to be a menacing foe While there are aliens and bad guys to battle, the tone of Supergirl is generally fun and cheerful  Kara is a delightful character, although the series highlight for me is the season 1 episode 'Fallen' when Kara becomes infected with Red Kryptonite and becomes much LESS of a sweetie!

It's not preachy, it never once mentions  girl power  or anything of the sort, and even goes out of its way to remind you that Superman is a hero in this universe MORE powerful than Supergirl  Anyone crying on here about SJW's is clearly a little man with self-esteem issues That said, the first 7-8 episodes of the first season are weak, but it's mainly due to the same issues that plague any show  It takes a bit to find its voice, but once it gets rolling it's a solid villain of the week show with an under-current of season-long plot (a la The Flash or The Arrow)  Kara Zor-El is lovable, Martian Manhunter is spectacularly realized (if a bit weaker than he should be), and the ensemble surrounding them is solid Some suspension of disbelief is required (with several super-powered aliens, some of them Kryptonian, threatening to destroy the world, why doesn't Supergirl ask for Clark's help ever?), but it's never enough to distract from the fun  Now that the show is on the CW, I'm hopeful it'll find the same rhythm as the other Berlantiland shows, but season 1 is still solid and fun Again, if you like super heroes, you'll enjoy this show  It baffles me how DC's television division can be crushing it this much while their movie universe is a straight abortion  ",8,0.4,8.4,"Positive"

Also please stop preaching to us  Kryptonians worrying about us destroying our planet, enough already  Hopefully the writing will improve, and the story lines will not be as lame  As to the acting, which many of you hate  When my daughters were young, I was forced to watch a show with them, called Small Wonder, ever since then, everything I have seen seems Oscar worthy So I cannot really comment on the acting  ",7,0.5,7.5,"Positive"

These nitty gritty shows with lots of dark themes and holy sht that's dark and I really like it moments?It's simple  Because - my fellow people who also love this show but seem outspoken - this show is the complete opposite  In the words of a critic on Rotten tomatoes: I need a show in my life that's about hope  Supergirl provides just enough sugar in an otherwise bleak diet  People used to dark and grim, need not bother, it's not for you  The rest of us will enjoy it for the pure, blissful fun that it is  And I would've put that as my review if not for the IMDb line requirements  Just being straight and honest, I love Supergirl because it's the only show that really puts hope in my heart for a better tomorrow  It always puts a smile on my face and teaches me lessons to make me a better person  Life is too full of the cynical and while some cynicism keeps us grounded, I think we need much much more light in our TV viewings  Supergirl is what i think of when I have a bad day or when I just need someone to tell me it's all going to be alright  If I have a bad day, looking at GOT and seeing someone have a worse day doesn't make me feel better  It just makes me feel even more depressed  I think the critics can see that  This show got a 96% on Rotten for a reason  Not even some of the greatest shows get that on their first season  Believe me, this show knows what it's doing, and it does it not to perfection, rather, to a great effect  If you want to really criticise Supergirl  Talk about its non perfect special effects (I mean, it doesn't really have the enormous budget that shows like Daredevil had), or its sometimes infidelity to its source material  Because these things are things that comic book fans don't like and understandably so  But ask yourself if today's society is just getting so used to being spiteful, hopeless, and cynical about everything and anything (complaining about the world, talking about changing it but then giving up because they say there's nothing that can be done, or otherwise something would've been done etc  etc )  In the end, I'm a truly big fan of Supergirl  I love it  I love it more than the Flash, Arrow, Daredevil and all other shows I've ever watched including Lost  And if you love it too, but feel outspoken, well   You are not alone  ",10,0.4,10,"Positive"

"Supergirl","2016-08-31"," I really like Arrow (as it is essentially just a Batman show using Arrow), but it often seems to waste a lot of time and spin it's wheels with it's long seasons    Flash was even better, because it came into Arrows world, and ran with it, like DC/Marvel TV shows and movies ALWAYS should have!Supergirl has taken this to the next level! Not only is she in 'their' world, FINALLY Superman is in HERS!!! Even though I am only about 8 episodes in, the subtle way Superman is in this show is what DC/Marvel always should have done  If you don't use the characters (or can't) then still talk about them, that is the world your character lives in! I have no problem with 'black Jimmy', I hate these characters like traditional him, and 'Aunt May' that seemed trapped in amber, he is both likable and the coolest version of 'Supermans best pal' I loved the Martian Manhunter reveal, and Red Tornado, they have really started out with all the ducks in a row, character and story wise  The formula is almost exactly like Smallville, Arrow and Flash with the hero and its supporting cast, regular villain, sidekick, unrequited love  It's working, so no reason to change it I guess Supergirl is both adorable and completely awesome, her casting is perfection, costume looks fantastic and super-sexy, if Melissa Benoist wasn't so strong and perfect, Calista Flockhart would not work in this role because she is such a strong and show stealing actor I've always been a bigger Marvel fan, but after Smallville, Arrow, Flash and now this, DC is my TV universe of choice  This is probably the most likable and enjoyable show with constant payoffs for fanboys and the layman viewer alike I can't wait to get home and keep watching this show!

"Supergirl","2016-08-18"," The acting is terrible, the special effects are terrible, and the writing is terrible  I laugh through the whole thing because it's so bad  It appears as if the show has a fifty dollar budget per season  I don't think the writers have actually heard people have conversations, as the dialogue is extremely flat and the conversations do not flow like real conversations  I'd feel bad for the actors if they were any good  Also, Supergirl's powers do not seem well defined  Sometimes she seems as powerful as she should be (compared to the comics) and other times not at all  It's very confusing  Lastly, costuming is very unrealistic  All of the characters look like they just purchased their clothing that morning from the Gap  None of the clothes look lived in  A minor pet peeve, but I felt I should include it  ",2,-0.7,1.3,"Negative"
"Supergirl","2016-08-17"," I can't believe how many of these reviews are being written by people who sound a lot like me  old comic fans hoping for something better  Waited a long time and it's finally here  what a disappointment not only supergirl but the  gene  as a whole  for too long I've watched shows that claimed to be about people with super powers and how they learn to use those powers for good and justice and so on and what do I get, shows about  kids  who have to fit in  who don't worry about saving lives but rather if they can play football and score with Lana  For twenty years all I've seen is shows from Warner's/DC which just scream  BE NORMAL  that super powers are wrong! Who in their right mind would chose to give up superman's powers to be normal   maybe Batman   he's sightly demented (hear he takes little kids into violent crime zones)but hey I know it's all a  fantasy  but give me a break are you trying to tell me that all the stories dealing with  gods  in the past, now and future show Zeus sitting on his throne just praying, begging to be normal!! Why do I keep referring to  the big guy  when doing a review of Supergirl   well guess what guys  she's the best gosh darn superman ever (only the animated shows are better)    guess they were right girls do have to work twice as hard  Kara tells us each week how she has always wanted to use her GREAT powers for GOOD and I believe her  she is the best I've ever seen at it  but there is ONE SMALL PROBLEM she also BRAGS that when she arrived on Earth once she discovered that we had Superman we had enough superheros (ONE!!!) so she would use her amazing powers TO BE THE greatest secretary in the world (must be millions of them  but I can assure you, Kara is the fastest at shorthand) IN FACT, for the past twelve years she has practiced and refined her use of her superhearing to the point where can she tune out the screams for help, all the police sirens, all the fire alarms AND be able only know when her boss is about to arrive and have her coffee ready  WHAT A HERO!???  you know how hard this was to stomach and still watch this   had to, got a crush on SUPERGIRL, it has got to get better  meet the cast now not very big  strange tho  this is the daily planet  wait no that can't be right  no met Perry White  no he's a woman?? Wait a minute I've seen this show  wasn't it the Adventures Of Superman  just don't remember all the women   must be all the drugs  no it's just that this show ain't original at all  kind of feels rushed  like kind of faster then a speeding bullet rushed  give them credit almost a perfect copy of the Daily Planet and it's crew   only noticed one mistake  there seems to be two Jimmy Olson s (maybe he's Lois Lane huh),nah the writings so clever that you know this poor guy is DOOMED DOOMED DOOMED he's one them there red shirts on Star Trek  he ain't going make it to the end of this pilot,,,ah, wait he did in fact live to go on to become Lois Lane   I think  nah he's doomed just not yet   but you just wait that first kiss is going to be a killer   well you just hold on to your draws boys this is the best  For the next four or five weeks this  girl  proves herself time and again  She is perfect in so many ways  within no time she proves she's A WOMAN a serious and unbelievable fantastic person (who very shortly should finally receive her long awaited godhood medal after all these years) TEN WEEKS  this is one great superhero show  well it was  you see Kara/Supergirl/Superman gets it wrong and she was doing so well  she forgot that she was suppose to save Lois Lane not kill him  oh and how she does it  this fantastic woman turns into  teenage Kid  and rips his heart out and craps on it not once, but as far as I can tell twenty or thirty more times   I really liked how about three days later after  burying  Lois  she announces she's going out on her first real date,what caring what kindness   BULL Kara would never have done this and Supergirl would never have allowed it to have happened,,what is even cooler  everyone one on the show every character knew about his love and knew where it was headed and they all stood by and let it happen   the kid has some real friends  This show was doing so well as a superhero show  now it's just another teenage soap opera, showing kids destroying each others lives in they quest to be normal,,,SORRY SUPERGIRL  I wish you luck, but I can't set here any more and watch you destroy all those around you  You know I hear that later in the season you will feel the effects  of red krytonite,what are you going to do, kill your best friend, for real this time  oh and slowly  rip his heart out and laugh  no I bet you'll kiss him and say you're sorry as his lifeless body slides to the floor,,wait that's evil and only Kara knows about love and how to handle it  she's the one that has to kill him,,his best friend  his love his goddess  I'm not very good at soaps  neither is Kara   WHY COULDN'T YOU LET SUPERGIRL LIVE  why did you kill this boy  in doing so you killed Kara  Supergirl and me  well as I shut off the program for the last time I offer this advice to Kara:quit your day jobstop trying to be a girl, be a WOMAN for once  NO,be the SUPERWOMAN you should have always been   but it's only a fantasy  a TV show who cares   maybe us old timers, who thought of our heroes  our SUPER HEROES were worth believing in  oh well there are plenty of other shows to watch, I hear there's a great western show on in the afternoon  believe it's called General Hospital  oh wait maybe, it's another superhero show  ",1,0.8,1.8,"Negative"
"Supergirl","2016-08-03"," I think 6/10 is a fair score for something I don't look out for, but record and watch when I'm on my spin bike  I can watch leisurely but it won't matter if I miss a bit of dialogue here and there during my sprints It's goofy and lame but visually appealing - Supergirl is off the chart fitness and I'd watch it just to see her in that outfit every week  As with most mainstream shows of this nature, all the people are thin trim and good looking and you won't see a fat person for miles Most of the characters are way overdone, and none, even Supergirl are true to the either original or established character framework  In fact both Supergirl's abilities and character have been warped so badly I'm not even sure anyone identifies with her    but for the name and big red 'S' on her rather fetching top  Jimmy Olsen will probably grate against the nerves of viewers since he's been totally re-written, (and I'm not simply referring to colour)  The scrawny red haired kid that needed a watch to call superman when he was in trouble has gone  There would be less contrast if you' swapped Pee wee Herman for Arnold Swartzenegger  The acting is actually quite good and I'm surprised at the level of competence achieved given the script they're often given to work with  David Harewood is particularly good as its Calista Flockhart - though her character is somewhat overdone, but the whole cast is surprisingly able The special effects aren't exactly blockbuster worthy and probably won't stand the scrutiny of hard-core comic book or sci-fi fans, but are certainly better than the stuff you see on the Sci-Fi channel films, and good enough for the average TV audience There are too many villains and aside from Peter Facinelli (more of a mild protagonist that a villain) who plays Maxwell Lord not enough 'badguy' development  Most of the successful Sci-fi series have learnt the sub-plot development of the baddie with reappearances at stages in the series works well if not over-extended  This show seems to have badguy's 'on tap' and I'm amazed Supergirl has time to don that particularly enticing outfit (seriously she's hot) let alone lust after Jimmy Olsen (doesn't work for me really, but I give it some leeway) I don't really get the feminist angle some people irk about  It just seems normal every day stuff to me, slightly exaggerated for the screen of course but nothing to moan about  However that's not to say their aren't some background agendas at work here  As a male chauvinist I quite like the strength of the female characters  They certainly are not shoving feminist propaganda at you as some have mentioned, but lets be fair here; Supergirl is not one of the strong female characters  She's winey and weak and sell absorbed  She constantly relies on the strength of others to get herself on track, has very little self esteem and panders shallow questionable aspirations  Suffice it to say she has very few redeeming character traits  Here's the kicker, she pretty so it OK  I like it  Its 'BubbleGum' entertainment at best, but it is getting a bit better as the series goes on  ",6,0.8,6.8,"Positive"
"Supergirl","2016-06-21"," Believe me    I wanted to like this series    I wanted a good Supergirl  I've even watched the entire first season so I can say in response to all those  hang in there, it gets better  reviews    For what? There is nothing coming that will make the show anything more then a sad rip off of better super man series  First off I'll get it out of the way right away, the writers are awful and this is best demonstrated by their constant misuse of Superman    It is clearly obvious that WB put limits on what they could do with him    and to be frank he'd be better absent then what they have done with him  Some of the stupidest writing is directly related to him  In the episode following up how she says she needs to learn to accept help from friends, they right him in saving her from certain death from a villain    her response?  I can't have superman saving me every-time I'm in trouble    fine next time just die that's what was gonna happen  In the scene it happened we only get to see a blurred image of him as he saves her, then later him on their fake im service apologizing as Clark    The sad part was as bad as this scene was    this was his better cameo    as the next time was outright horrid writing, I'd say I'd expect better from a 12 year old fan writing fan-fiction then this episode delivered    Superman's in space doing something    stop right there    no further writing needed I could forgive this, but no they had to bring him back and get controlled by a mind control device for humans which effected him because he was on earth so long because that has ever been used in a story before    I could forgive it if I mean at this point he's here on earth controlled by the bad guys so a confrontation between superman and supergirl    but no they can't do that because they are so limited in what they can show of him, so instead she fights her earth sister who is wearing a super suit of some type and attacking her with a kryptonite katana  But another problem is the villains, a lot of them are lesser versions of other superman villains or female ones  Powergirl and Bizzaro were mixed into one, Indigo (feels rewritten to be Brainiac in this), red tornado (as a bad guy?!), Livewire, Banshee (My gosh laziness on the writing side for flash, Barry ends up fighting 2 different sonic screamers from different dimensions in one season!, not to mention multiple speedsters in 2 seasons) to name a few  Non and Astra are 2  original  characters, and by original rip-offs of General Zod and Ursa (making them a couple doesn't make them any less a rip off)  Fort Rozz is a rip off of phantom zone, no getting around that  Max Lords, who makes me laugh the most, his actor going on to comment how he is different from Lex Luthor  He is a billionaire scientist who has it out for an alien wearing an S and Cape and has some casual interest in a female relevant in their lives, I mean that's completely different from Lex (I mean look at that head of hair) This one might sound nit-picky and racist    but seriously its not about that, Samuel L Jackson is a great Nick Furry, Michael Clark Duncan as Kingpin was about the only good thing about daredevil the movie, but I have to say it, Mechad Brooks is the worst possible choice ever for Jimmy Olsen  Why? For one thing, he isn't nerdy at all, he's bald, he's too attractive for the character    I didn't even know he was Jimmy Olson til the 3rd episode I thought Winslow Scott Jr  was Jimmy as he looks the part of Jimmy Olson  It's one thing to rewrite an important character to the series, but this actually irritates me as it suggests DC no longer respects Jimmy as a character and think of him as a throw away character    you want to make him black    that's fine    but you have to have someone who fits Jimmy and not so you can create some weird love triangle involving Supergirl But before I end I will give it credit where it is due    The Hank Henshaw turning out to be Martian Manhunter was an enjoyable twist  Cat Grant role initially annoyed me with them making her an important feminist stereotype, but she at least was a consistent character (more then can be said for Kara or Kara's sister)  I now find that since the series is moving she isn't even going to be a recurring character  I was really hoping there would be more out of Dean Cain too, instead he's barely been in it Ultimately I don't get any of it's praise it's got, its writing is rarely decent more often coming off as bad fan fiction  The fact that it now part of the Arrowverse continuum is saddest part of all this as it means she is relevant to Flash  It's really sad CW thought this was more valuable to save then Constantine  ",3,-0.4,2.6,"Negative"
"Supergirl","2016-06-18"," Is it really too much to ask for some originality   OK fine   Super-Girl's story isn't much different from The Man of Steel's   But that's not the problem I have with this show   How many times are we gonna see the same old high school mentality story lines  ?? Guy #1 has a crush on girl #1, but not only is he stuck in the friend zone with her, she has a crush on guy #2   So sooner or later, guy #1 is gonna walk in on guy #2 kissing girl #1 which of course will break his heart   But the writers aren't gonna shock us (don't make me laugh) with that scenario just yet   So how do they stretch things out so it can last a full season  ??Oh here's an idea   Let's bring in girl #2 who just happens to be in a complicated relationship with guy #2, which of course makes girl #1 all dough eyed and jealous   A love square instead of a love triangle   Sadly that's the best angle that the writers could come up with for this show   And what's even worse is that the creators of this show really think they've accomplished something by switching networks   As far as I'm concerned   It doesn't really matter that this show has moved from CBS to the CW   Because that tends to happen with TV shows that put out crap written by people who can't or won't graduate high school   And that's all there is too it    ",1,-0.1,1,"Negative"
"Supergirl","2016-06-18"," Another female-driven TV show? YES, PLEASE! It's great when these types of shows come on, you see conventions and stereotypes twisted and it changes your perspectives on things  'Supergirl' does just that and gives women the ability to see that they can channel their own Supergirl in their own way and use it in their every day lives  Kara Zor-El (Melissa Benoist) is sent to Earth from Krypton to protect her cousin Kal-El  On her way, Kara's spacecraft was hit by Krypton's explosion and sends it to the Phantom Zone  But when she finally lands on Earth she's saved by her cousin, who has now become Superman, and takes her to the Danvers family  Now 24 years old, Kara learns to embrace her powers and becomes Supergirl I think every girl out there can relate to Kara  I know I can  Melissa's portrayal as Kara is brilliant; funny, a little socially-awkward and very sweet  I see her has the female equivalent of Barry from 'The Flash')  They could be best friends  She even has a crush on James Olsen (Mehcad Brooks), who she's afraid to reveal her feelings to  I feel like we don't get to see these types of girls on television anymore  There's definitely a pressure for girls to look a certain way nowadays and Kara brings back the ideology that girls don't have to succumb to that pressure  Embrace your awkwardness and be yourself  Now, as Supergirl, Kara is strong and determined  Flying into danger, without any regard of her own life  Her only thought is to save the people of National City  I have to admit, I am a bit jealous of how she is able to balance her double life  Only one season in, I can see that this show will continue to be great  I personally think that that there needs to be more shows like this  That shows the real depiction of how girls can be  It sends a strong message to every girl out there to stay true to themselves and have the courage to not conform to society  ",10,0.2,10,"Positive"
"Supergirl","2016-06-14"," In the first episode, Supergirl attempts to fly after not having done so in years  She's up, she's down, she's up, she's down, <U+0085> And that's the way the first season went except whereas in Episode 1 Supergirl finally soars, the freshman show never quite gets airborne  Supergirl has a strong cast and an exceptional hero yet its ratings weren't high enough for CBS to renew it (it was sent to the CW network)  So what went wrong?What worked: Melissa Benoist <U+0096> With the show build around her, casting Supergirl correctly was critical  Fortunately, Ms  Benoist isn't just good, or even great  She is, in a word, <U+0096> tell me you didn't see this one coming <U+0096>  Super   As Supergirl, she was completely convincing from her beginnings as an eager, earnest, but inexperienced heroine to the season concluding mature, composed, and confident champion  As Kara, she's a bit klutzy but I guess one has to try something to pretend folks won't realize you're Supergirl's doppleganger  Regardless, she owns the role and hits a home run way, way out of the park Relationships <U+0096> If Ms  Benoist was the heart of the show, relationships were its soul  With its perhaps too large cast, there were more relationships than time to fully develop them but the big three were SG <U+0096> Alex, SG <U+0096> Manhunter <U+0096> Alex, and SG/Kara <U+0096> Cat Grant  In these, the parties grew and changed for the better  The issues were significant such as the baggage Alex carried from growing up with a demigod or Supergirl coping with a trusted friend (ultimately learning it was Alex) killing one of her two remaining blood relatives or Kara mentoring Cat on family and being mentored on hope  All in all, really good stuff The show's tone <U+0096> This isn't Zack Snyder's universe of dark, morose characters  In fact, the closest parallel to Supergirl might be Officer Hopps in Zootopia  Both are driven to protect and help, they refuse to give in to overwhelming odds or give up after failure, and both are perpetually optimistic or at least don't stay depressed for very long  But this isn't bad  Most of the recurring characters in Supergirl could be role models and while I feel it's certainly a female-centric show, I don't see that it's misandristic  Except for Maxwell Lord (always the sharpest though most bent blade in the drawer), the featured males equal the women as role models  What doesn't workJames Olsen <U+0096> In the comics Jimmy, as he is called, is an impetuous, freckled redhead  Mehcad Brooks definitely isn't but it's not his lack of freckles or red hair that's the issue  Rather, it's the same Olsen issue that exists in the comics, that of getting face time with the hero  The comics dealt with this by having Olsen getting into trouble (remember  impetuous ?) and Superman saving him  That clearly isn't going to work on this show  Mr  Brooks is second billed yet is the least defined of the major characters because of his lack of quality screen time  In a superhero action/adventure show, the playground of the hero isn't a place for normal mortals  The DEO field agents are supposed to be highly trained operatives but if their name isn't Alex, they might as well suit up in Star Trek red uniforms  So if not in the field, how does Olsen interact with Supergirl? The writer's appear to be taking the romance tack for more face time but comic writers tried this with Lois Lane for 73 years before finally killing the idea of a Lois <U+0096> Clark/Superman romance in 2011 because of the problems integrating her into his action/adventure universe  The producers should never have introduced Olsen into the show  Mr  Brooks would have been much better served being cast as Maxwell Lord, National City's morally challenged answer to Tony Stark, who could find ways to participate in fights or disasters without being completely out of place and is intrinsically more interesting than Olsen  As it is, Olsen is a millstone weighing down the show The writing <U+0096> Even Ms  Benoist can't carry a show where the writing doesn't provide some foundation for her to stand on  In what was the most fun episode of the season, the Flash crossover, a second rate villain takes out both Supergirl and the Flash but is then defeated by firemen with a hose  Huh? Or in the continuity department, Supergirl flies into space to say prayers over her Aunt's casket yet in the season finale, going into space is a one way ticket to death since as Alex says, she can't breath, can't fly, can't return from there  Or after building up the Supergirl-Cat relationship, coming back from Christmas break and having Cat go off the rails and out of character by firing Kara for not confessing she is Supergirl  For all these little things, the larger issue was there was no compelling Season 1 story line  Fort Roz appeared intended for this purpose but half the episodes had nothing to do with this line and didn't advance it in any way  And Fort Roz was fatally flawed from the start, at least in terms of logic  Since Roz came to earth with her, why did the criminals wait until she was an adult to make their move? They outnumbered her tremendously but never just tried to overwhelm her? Pretty bumbling criminals  In summary, Season 1 was OK but not more  The ingredients for a great show are there but the writers need to up their game, come up with more compelling antagonists, develop more than just a  villain of the week  approach, and provide more for Olsen to do than just stand around and respond to Cat's  I want a picture  with,  I'm on it  or be in a doomed romance  But with Ms  Benoist in the lead, there's hope for Season 2  ",7,0.4,7.4,"Positive"

"Supergirl","2016-05-27"," The low score for this series is rather sad  DC finally gets it right, but of course, everybody wants something else    who knows what  Ignore the cynics: Supergirl excels on every count: casting, mood, visuals, character and even plot (typically DC's Achilles heel)  As a bonus, it superbly captures that old-time DC feeling - without becoming either syrupy or campy Some may argue that the series is too soft, too childish  That's absurd  There are lots of harsh events in this show - a number of brutal and very significant deaths, for a start  What critics are shying away from isn't childishness, it's *innocence*  Something that's out of fashion, much to the detriment of our entire culture But that's exactly the theme here: innocence vs cynicism  Simplicity vs complexity  And, yes, good vs evil  We see the original 1959 Supergirl, facing ills that are essentially modern  She wants to fight evil without becoming part of an evil world, without losing the essential innocence that gives her her strength  That's a really powerful idea  It's what the best of us are trying to do every day: overcome the horrible problems facing our world, without becoming cynical, defeatist, negative (or *old*) It's what makes a hero: resisting evil not with a gun, or with your fists, but denying it with your very nature Melissa Benoist is perfectly cast, as a very human young woman, unsure of her abilities, her social standing, her emotions - and yet both deeply caring and fundamentally tough  She out-shines every screen version of Superman by light years, because she actually has a strong personality - one that's depicted vividly, and which sits squarely at the core of all the stories In a way, it might be fair to say that Supergirl is the 'chick-flick' of DC superhero shows  In the sense that it deals with emotion seriously, frankly, realistically  It never cops out with the make-believe angst of a show like Arrow  Instead, it shows us *genuine* affection between Kara and her sister, *genuine* friendship between Supergirl and Hank Henshaw  It shows us strong, painfully real emotions as they are sorely tested - but never bent or trivialized just for the convenience of a bonehead plot Supergirl is far and away the best TV series DC has done so far (other than Gotham, of course, which isn't really a 'superhero' show), the one DC series that really has some dramatic meat on its bones  It's exactly because Supergirl succeeds as drama that it's able to present us with a super-heroine who's worthy of the name I enjoy the other DC shows, but Supergirl is the only one that has me counting the days between episodes UPDATE: As we near the end of Season Two, my admiration for this series is unshaken  The characters continue to ring true  The romantic relationships, which could easily be horribly over-done, instead feel plausible and remarkably genuine  And the action side remains resolutely true to the best 1950s DC traditions - a bit silly, a bit wacky, yet with a consistent logic that dodges the kind of incessant let-downs we've seen in Arrow and Flash One example: a recent episode dealt with the idea of Supergirl being blackmailed by threats to one of her human friends  Flash has faced this situation multiple times, and has cravenly capitulated each time (usually giving up his super-powers, just to underscore what an idiot he is)  Supergirl is told firmly that she *can't* negotiate with terrorists - and she doesn't  Instead, she finds an intelligent solution to the problem, that doesn't depend on mere super-muscle Lesson: even silly super-heroics benefit from clever writing  Which Supergirl has in abundance, and the other DC shows (save Gotham) emphatically do not  ",9,0.4,9.4,"Positive"

"Supergirl","2016-04-19"," Let's get one thing out of the way right away, I'm not a DC Universe fan boy and I couldn't tell you much about any of the people on this show  Nor have I watched the other shows these guys produced like The Flash so i come into this unbiased  I'm not trashing this show just because I think I'm smarter than the creative team  I can discount some of the complaints (or chips on their shoulders I should say) about feminism because the show is called SuperGirl  It's pretty obvious who the center of attention will be  This is your typical hero in the spotlight show with sidekicks and the sidekicks happen to be two dudes  Yeah, the computer guy is a little too sensitive to be believable and the black photographer guy is too wise to be believable  But, putting that aside, let's talk about the real problems here The series structure is the real problem  Even starting with the pilot, the show runs away too fast  This is probably due to the way they wanted to make the series  Every episode Supergirl has to solve  a case  aka Fight someone while there are attempts to weave a background story along the way The acting, it's all over the place  Sometimes Kara comes off believable but just as many times it just doesn't work  Her baddie aunt never comes off well  The only person who comes off consistently good in the show is the DEO head (Martian black guy) The costumes, as indicated I'm no fan boy and the SuperGirl costume works fine for me  If there's a better one, I haven't seen it  This talk about it looking like a Halloween costume I don't get  If anything, some of the various villain costumes suffer more than anything else  But, that's another issue caused by the structure of the series The effects, like the acting, the effects are a mixed bag  Some of them actually look really good  Some others look like something someone did on a home PC The structure of the series is causing almost every issue  After watching 9 episodes, there is very little character arc going on  We're in too much of a rush to even go there  The villains in the show are paper thin  Who has time for that when this week we're fighting nuclear man and next week we're fighting a robot? How can you spend the time to choreograph a good fight scene and effects when these things happen almost every episode? And the fights don't matter very much if the audience isn't invested in the characters (villains too)  They're just an excuse to show off a mixed bag of effects, there's no tension  Some of the villains look crappy because there's too dang many of them  If there would have been 3 or 4 the whole season, they would have looked 3x better and the effects would have been solid throughout So in short, this show is just terribly uneven because of the way they decided to make it  Take a series like DareDevil, different structure and different result  I could see how some people would like the show  In reality, SuperGirl is less a serious TV show and more like a live action version of the Super Friends cartoon  It has about the same level of depth to it as a cartoon  For a series so uneven, I think a 4 out of 10 is a fair score  ",4,0.6,4.6,"Negative"

Here's the thing about this show  It's far from perfect  The pilot, at times, felt like a kid high off candy - too excitable to be charming  The first few episodes stumbled through a plot  Writing has been somewhat inconsistent, and yes, characters have been changed from their traditional comic-book origins  But the show has been consistent with one thing - it captures the essence of Supergirl  This isn't Arrow or Gotham, where Man!Pain fuels the story along  It isn't supposed to be  This is the story about a young woman coming into her own  Of course it's going to have a strong feminist angle  After years of listening to whiny male superheroes, I'm delighted that we finally have a hero, dealing with balancing what it means to be a woman with what it means to be a superhero  This is designed to be a show that parents can watch with their kids  That doesn't make it infantile or immature, but it does mean that it's going to be lighter than say Arrow  This isn't a bad thing The show has been consistently getting better  It does a fantastic job of showing off the Superman mythos, while keeping it about Kara, reminding us that this is her story  It has a great cast of women Melissa Benoist absolutely captures Kara's dorky persona, as well as the strength of Supergirl  She's a revelation, after watching so many heroes brood on our screens  Calista Flockhart is not just the bitchy boss; she's shown to care deeply about National City and Supergirl herself  She plays the role with so many nuances, it's fascinating to watch  Chyler Leigh, who plays Kara's sister, Alex is equally engaging, and it's refreshing seeing a cast of female characters who aren't sniping or plotting against each other  This show might have taken a while to find its feet, but it's getting there, and the ride has been an enjoyable one  This show has become charming and sweet, and quirky and everything I would have expected from Supergirl  It focuses on hope and friendship and family and why should these values be ridiculed just because they're championed by a girl?

"Supergirl","2016-02-25"," I thought this might be a good show but there is only so much political reeducation dogma you can smuggle into my house disguised by a cute young girl in a superhero mini-costume  There has been quite a bit recently but in the latest episode the un-freckled and un-redhead Jimmy Olsen castigated Supergirl for  running her own private Guantanamo  which was not only a pretty harsh falsehood, was politically timed dogma  Supergirl did not even stand up for herself but instead caved   because everyone is supposed to automatically agree that Guantanamo = bad  Never mind that it's not her department (she's not in charge)  She doesn't own the lock-down which is run by the government to secure dangerous aliens  Never mind that she can't shut it down and should not be responsible for releasing anyone, she completely was blamed Ultimately in the story she was the one that had to act  She releases a dangerous criminal to the streets because holding him even with the 'room full of criminal case files against him' was  wrong   OK, I'm willing to stipulate that holding US citizens without due process is wrong   but you don't do what our president does and release dangerous people to the streets to make a political statement  They need to be tried and if convicted go to prison  That's what you do with US citizens who break the law and for whom you have collected a preponderance of evidence to convict  Notice they did not address the alien terrorists which there evidently were quite a few  Can you imagine the disaster releasing alien terrorists to the streets would cause? Yep they didn't address this because even they know this would be a no win for them It's a minor point but it's enough to be annoying  Watching the show I felt compelled to stop the show and teach my kids why what Jimmy Olsen said to Kara was wrong  Please try not to teach my children incorrect principles  thanks a lot Supergirl  ",4,-0.3,3.7,"Negative"
"Supergirl","2016-02-25"," I really want to like this show  It has some great moments and a likable lead  That's the good side, now for the darkside:1) Please, please, please try to keep the plot holes from multiplying like rabbits on a diet of Viagra  Example: the first episode where Supergirl meets her evil aunt, she thinks she is her mother, but learns in a bit of  evil guy dialog  that she is her aunt that she was never told about  A few episodes later we find out that Kara and her aunt were once the best of buds    what the Hell  2)Preach it baby  This show is very much in tune with women rule and boys drool, especially white boys  ALL the major villains are white guys full of  white privilege   General Lang, Mr  Lords, Nom(the real Kryptonian villain as his wife - Kara's aunt - is really a good person inside), the Trickster, all evil white guys  The heroes are selected from a college course on women and minority studies  I have no problem with heroes being of whatever color or gender  I do have a problem when the show gets preachy about how white guys are evil and stacks the deck in such a way that it is painfully obvious  The only sympathetic white guy is a nerd and even with that his dad is evil  3) Too much suspension of belief  Not the lasers coming out of Supergirl's eyes  The fact that she would love her job working for Han Solo's wife (Flockart)who plays an utterly detestable character who has the heart of the Grinch, Donald Trump's narcissism and Hillary Clinton's bitchy I can do no wrong attitude  Sometimes it is funny how over the top she plays the role, reminds me of Shatner's acting skills  4) Why are they ruining the role of Jimmy Olsen? In NO universe is Jimmy a highly confident tall muscely black man  Where is the awkward red head with freckles  I'm sure they did this because this show is more concerned with appeasing the PC gods (see #2)  Sad that they could not be a bit truer to the source material  Will I keep watching the show, maybe  I do get tired of the disjointed plots and every show learning about how evil white guys are, but it does at times redeem itself  They better move their low bar a little higher and soon  ",4,-0.1,3.9,"Negative"

Overall Melissa Benoist is too old play SuperGirl but old enough to play Superwoman !The TV series lacks total originality is just blatantly ripping off Superman story if your just going to replicate Clarke Kent mild mannered reporter with Kara Danvars Smallville clone would have been better story vehicle inspiring young girls who get bullied in school and courageously turning the other cheek, similar to Joss Whedon's Buffy Vampire slayer ",2,0.2,2.2,"Negative"
"Supergirl","2016-02-24"," With an influx of superhero TV series and movies, I was excited to see a show that features a female superhero Unfortunately, after watching 3 episodes of Supergirl, I couldn't watch more of this garbage As much as I appreciate family orientated television series, it's a fact that family-friendly theme and excellent acting/dialogue are NOT mutually exclusive!The plot is too uninspiring, and the characters are dull, immature, and lacking in sophistication in some form of character development  It made no sense that a group of 20 year old are behaving like egocentric school age children The scripts are terribly written, acting is cringe-worthy, CG seems outdated, and the overall execution is very disappointing I really wanted to like this show, but there is just too many things to dislike about Supergirl  ",1,-0.4,1,"Negative"
"Supergirl","2016-02-23"," The show is absolutely awful  Promised a female hero, and instead we get a whiny female teen who needs government handlers to tell her when to blast meaningless baddies Superman is conveniently too busy to handle with her eye lasers because apparently, she can't even make that decision without consulting with someone Those are, by the way, my fiancé's words on the show  She absolutely loathes it  In fact, she watches Skorpion some nights, but will change the channel when Supergirl starts and change it back when its over The problem is the writing  The show is really, really awful  The dialogue is cheesy; the villain of the week flavor structure is sad and renders any bad guy meaningless  Changing Jimmy Olsen the way they did also irked me, personally <U+0096> not because they made him black <U+0096> I could care less about the skin color of the actor <U+0096> but because apparently, the bespectacled, somewhat clumsy yet lovable Jimmy Olsen somehow wasn't good enough for this cast  And let's not forget all that talking about FRIENDZONE<U+0085>  Seriously? Can this show be more immature than that? I'm not against memes, sometimes they can be fun, but to see grown ups talking about friendzone in the work place makes me think if the script for this show isn't actually being made by teens, who can't even read aloud what they're writing Now about the female example of strong and independent woman, I think Supergirl isn't even trying  I would watch a show about Felicity Smoak alone, instead of Supergirl  She has the character, the presence and personality you hope to see in a fictional being, everything needed to make her more believable, while Kara <U+0096> although I really like the actress herself <U+0096> has even less personality than the heroes from Teen Titans cartoon Oh, and one last thing: After watching Daredevil on Netflix and seeing the clever tie-in to the Marvel Universe used to explain his uniform, and how he went about getting, the lets-play-dressup method for the two person committee who designed Supergirl's costume in the pilot was laughably pathetic  It was, once more, my fiancé who first pointed this out and I agreed with her immediately  ",1,-0.1,1,"Negative"

This show is great except for above  Too much suspension of disbelief required when we've got a bunch of rovers on Mars showing no life! Krypton and other distant fictional worlds are fine  But if you include a world we know a lot about (Mars) and say these sentient aliens with powers came from there and offer no further explanation   then it's just dumb! If you want to blur the lines between fact and fiction   you got to do it right and make things seem plausible like in DaVinci's Code  Just putting a green Martian into the show out of the blue is insane  Yeah it might have a background in comics, but many viewers don't read comics  ",8,-0.2,7.8,"Positive"
"Supergirl","2016-02-12"," It is great to see a TV show with women of power at its center  Despite the fact that Calista Flockhart has the tendency to look slightly non-emotive in certain scenes, due to the lack of movement in her forehead region, she still manages to pull off the queen of media empires quite well Melissa Benoist's performance as Kara proves that a woman can be central to a television series while still being seen as something other than a sex object I, personally, am quite the fan of the feminist undercurrent this show has to it, despite the claims of other reviewers on this site  I also like the fact that we are not subjected to an exact copy of the comic book whereby we are forced to stick to a lovely format  But God forbid someone to be black and bald instead of white and ginger  But lets face it, you'd complain if this show were whitewashed to oblivion too  ",8,0.2,8.2,"Positive"
"Supergirl","2016-02-11"," First things first  After seeing some of the reviews on here about this series, SERIOUS consideration needs to be taken into account that MARVEL does NOT completely follow their own story lines either, citing that Tony Stark did not create Ultron like in the movie, as Hank Pym did in the comics for example    So to discredit this show on the basis of it not following the comic is ridicoulous  The show is what you make of it  In general, it is all set for the imagination  Helen Slater's Supergirl, came from Argo City, as Benoist came from Krypton to protect Superman  Does it really matter how the  Mythology  is told, or how the story develops? Supergirl, whether 1984, or time now, was a little quirky and naive, yet strong-willed and opinionated in her character and that is still instilled in the same character be it Slater or Benoist  The show itself started a little clunky at first, and I will admit with Hank, I had no clue who he was with the red eyes  But that was what captivated me  If someone didn't know by now, I was really surprised and actually did research on the Martian Manhunter when I found out about J'onn Jones  It took me back to watching Super Friends cartoons when I was a kid with him Maybe Supergirl wasn't a one hero show, but by adding another element into it like J'onn they definitely added interest, and added elements for a deeper well-defined story  For a first season, it definitely deserves 2 more seasons to develop and see how it continues  Possibly do Flash, and Arrow cameos every now and again Supergirl is still Supergirl, with an update from 1984  And Melissa Benoist does the part justice  We just need to see where it goes from here  ",9,0,9,"Positive"

"Supergirl","2016-02-10"," Okay, where to start  This is 2016, era of the comics movies and TV shows  Movies like Man of Steel, The Avengers have set the bar pretty high for the quality of the TV shows that are following them  In accordance to that, and the DC shows which are running right now, Supergirl has the weakest story line, CGI and not to mention, science of it Well, science is a tricky part when you're dealing with a being of god-like powers  Still, in The Flash, when he runs at Supersonic speeds, he usually breaks glasses around him (Later the Speed Force keeps him from destroying stuff around him while running fast)  Yet in the Supergirl promo/trailer, we see her creating a sonic boom while flying away in front of Catco  leaving the glass buildings around her intact  Anyway, it's not so important for everyone  Then there is the scenario where two super-powered beings are fighting  It's like watching Rousey and Holm fight  In MoS, when Supes and Zod were at it, super-powered beings as they are  created shock-waves with each punch they were throwing at one another, trail of destruction piled up as a consequence of the fight  Yet in the show, we see multiple super beings fight with little to no redress around structures to follow  Watching two powerful beings fight should be a feast for the eyes in this era with the CGI effects and all, but sigh  It's like watching Smallville all over again Talking about Smallville, Kryptonite was basically sold at random shops for free almost and government had infinite access to them, even though it's supposed to be a super rare element  Glimpse of the same domain can be seen in this show Although started off too cheesy, it did get a bit better with the story later on adding a low point  too much spices were added in a simple soup dish  I am still hopeful for this show, given that writing several stories and scripts about an overpowered being can be difficult  ",5,0.5,5.5,"Negative"
"Supergirl","2016-02-09"," When I first watched the pilot- it seemed like a flop and a show that I couldn't spare time for especially with the Arrow and Flash giving great episodes every week  But I came back to it when they said that The Flash was crossing over  And let me tell you- from the 3rd episode onwards- it's a hell of a ride  It picked up the same vibe as the Flash (get it? Vibe?)  The show evolved dimensions and when they added more and more characters from the DC mainstream like a certain very famous alien- it's now on par with the flash  As of episode 13- this show is going great  Hope it gets even better and CBS picks it for another 4-5 seasons at least cause this show has potential Sure Jimmy was like a thorn in the show but how they've integrated him now is worth watching  And it has a much better season so far as compared to Marvel's Agents of shield season 1  Give it a shot  And haters- please do not use feminism and casting as a way to show your disinterest  Of course a show with a female superhero will have to deal with real world female problems  You can't expect Ms  Benoist to start acting like Stephen Amell in Arrow  It's a family show that delivers what it sets out to do  Seriously- I can't wait for the crossover on 28th March 2016  Hope they have more of that  ",10,0.7,10,"Positive"
"Supergirl","2016-02-08"," When I saw episode #1, I thought this was the worst comic book superhero show today and possibly one of the worst shows period in any genre  Based on the pilot, the problem was simple - total lack of character development of Supergirl  I don't want to see her learn all the tricks, fly, and start saving falling planes overnight  I wanted to see it developed over time I want to see her grow up with all the growing pains  My feelings didn't change after episode 2 I was still disappointed after episodes 3 & 4  But I think after episode 5, it just grew on me  The show got a little more serious  It is a balancing act doing the right thing  Do you believe in the death penalty even for monsters and killers? Is it okay to kill as long as you are only killing other killers (like the show Dexter) ?One thing about Supergirl I like that no other Superman/Supergirl show or movie has ever showed - Supergirl learning martial arts  It makes perfect sense to me  I was glad to see this  Why didn't Superman learn martial arts? There are other alien reprobates who are just as strong  But if Superman knew martial arts, he could better fight them  Anyway, I see at times that Supergirl really wants to kill the villains or have her own brand of justice  It's her struggle  I like that  So the take home message is this  Supergirl doesn't have the best writing or acting  The actresses are all pretty and easy on the eye  The show gets better over time  It grows on you  And you may get addicted to Supergirl like me  ",10,-0.3,9.7,"Positive"
"Supergirl","2016-02-08"," After yet another bad episode, I wonder: how long can this last? The writing is just so very, very bad  For Supergirl to give a speech in the middle of a fight is just mindless  I'm reminded of a scene in the movie 'Van Helsing,' when one of Dracula's vampire wives is going to kill the princess (Kate Beckinsdale), she taunts her, finally ending  What do you think of that?  And Beckinsdale's character stabs her with a pointy stake and responds,  I think if you're going to kill someone, just kill them, don't talk them to death   THIS is how so many scenes in Supergirl are: punch, give a speech (usually,  You don't have to do this ), get knocked down/ thrown 100 feet away, get up, fly back, get punched again, fly out of the way just as the killing blow is about to be administered, then punch her adversary ______(fill in the villain) and end the fight  The Supergirl character is simply too dumb to be believable Add to this the many DEO agents who, by now, must know her 'secret identity,  if it can be called that, since, in the course of 4 episodes, at least 3 people learn of her identity, not to mention Maxwell Lord, who is far too smart to not put 2 and 2 together and realize she's related to  Agent Danvers   Chalk this up to the writers, who write for a first grade level (no insult intended to the many (much) smarter 1st graders out there  One minute she's angry and the next scene, she's happy and smiling even though she she's had to watch someone killed/maimed/tortured  The recovery time of her emotions would work for a sociopath, but not the kindhearted human being she is  It's too weak for words  Speaking of weak, her powers are abominably poor for a 'Super Girl ' She's been on earth for a decade or so, yet can't even lift a plane finger, struggles to get out of quicksand,can't dodge a gun, fist, or bomb at all, and, just plain slow in her use of her powers  If she was in a boxing ring, she'd be out after the first round  I like Benoit, because I can see her goodness, but in something like Supergirl, to use Mae West's phrase:  Goodness has(d) nothing to do with it   ",1,-0.6,1,"Negative"
"Supergirl","2016-02-08","  Supergirl  is a 'new' take on DC Comics' character and explores what it's like being a female super hero in a world where everyone already looks at the man of steel as their sole protector  Unlike Superman's solitary role, Supergirl is someone intricately tied to her friends and family, great part of her strength coming from values such as friendship and kindness -- something which today, on television, is rarely seen in such a raw, campy manner  With every episode, the show carries positive messages, feminist reinforcement for the many women who admire and take inspiration from a character like Supergirl  It carries that 1990's spirit that characterised popular TV series like Xena or Buffy: women are just as capable of getting things done, and have no need to fight other women for it Some level of criticism can be applied to how some episodes roll out, the general plot itself, or sometimes the overacting/stiffness of a character here and there but these are minimal things that shouldn't detract from enjoying the show itself because this is being developed on a different scope from other super hero shows, and it's fairly ridiculous to try and compare them when the differences are pretty clear Which brings to my final point that it's disingenuous that negative reviews that employ such language as  political correctness  or  feminist propaganda  continue to be featured as the hallmark of opinion on the show, not the expected commentary for a primary male demographic that has a hard time accepting that TV series can also be made with the aim of appealing to female demographics and providing them a source of not only entertainment but confidence and feminist empowerment  ",8,0.8,8.8,"Positive"

"Supergirl","2016-01-03"," I see the MRAs are out in force deriding Supergirl as feminist propaganda  This is FP in the same way the world is a matriarchy because men have to make the first move  Anyone who isn't a teenager in his mother's basement, angry that he's never felt the touch of a woman, would know that just having a woman in the titular role does not make something pro women and Supergirl is definitely not pro women  Superman retains his autonomy  He makes it clear, that his role is to help the world but he is not answerable to anyone  By contrast Supergirl has barely pulled her tights on before she relinquishes all autonomy to the DEO, an organisation she is not part of  She allows some man (whose name I don't care to remember) to berate her constantly for the choices she has made about her coming out, something that is entirely her prerogative and hers alone  So desperate is she to relinquish authority she begins referring to this man as  boss  so that she can feel comfortable knowing there is a man in charge and she's been relieved of all the pesky decision making  Calista Flockhart's character is an 80s power executive cliché who wields authority not by gaining the respect of her subordinates but by threatening them constantly with unemployment  Her management style would garner zero loyalty and trots out the tired stereotype that the only way women can lead is by being super bitches  Writing for Calista is so poor it frequently relies on the old  oh no, Kara's done it, she gone get fired now  only for Calista to say  I like this one, she's got moxy   In a later episode, Supergirl, not content with allowing DEO to call the shots, acquiesces to an Executive Order  Her alter ego is an American, but Supergirl is not, so why exactly is she required to follow an EO? She's not, but because she embodies a cornucopia of poor choices she allows herself to get  chickened  into agreeing to do something  Later, in this same episode, she is being repeatedly blamed for something in classic scapegoating  Ineffectual Supergirl splutters red faced, but is incapable of standing up for herself  Never fear though, boss man is here to save the day and gives her adversary a verbal dressing down  Something, weak, pathetic little Kara can't really manage   that is until she blows up at her boss because she can say boo to a woman  If there is anymore evidence of how Supergirl is definitely not pro women, Superman battles five Kryptonians and doesn't lose his powers  Supergirl has a five minute showdown with budget Vision and she loses her powers for days  At least in Smallville Kara was shown to be stronger than Clarke  I begrudgingly watched seven episodes before I decided that watching this show was above and beyond the call of duty  I appreciate a lot of the problems with Supergirl are due to the source material (DEO is canon) and female superheroes never work when they're just the female counterpart of a male superhero  This is gender swapped superman  Kara is working in a newspaper office?! (If she's answerable to DEO why isn't she on their payroll?)  She has a crush on a man who is crushing on her alter-ego (or would be if this stupid adaptation hadn't made supergirl reveal who she is to everyone of note in the pilot)  She disguises her identity by acting clumsy and dorkish with glasses  She speaks to her Kryptonian mother when she needs guidance  The Season Arc villain is shaping up to be a Lex Luthor Light (rich guy whose power is his colossal brain)  As huge nerd who is loving Flash and Arrow  I was really hoping DC would continue their trend of killing it in TV  But I guess the inability to write for a female superhero is still a problem in writers' rooms  If you can't write a super heroine with depth go back to feeding the MRAs with an actress with pneumatic boobs who has a talent for placing both her T and A in the shot at all times  At least then someone will be happy  ",1,-0.4,1,"Negative"
"Supergirl","2015-12-31"," OK so this one started out a little rough, rushed and much like a kid desperate to get your attention but from episode 4 onward it has come on leaps and bounds! Lets start with Kara    well she's no Felicity Smoak (who if you look up A-dork-able in the dictionary there is a picture of Felicity) but she does a pretty plausible job of being clumsy, awkward, put upon nerd by day and super heroine by night (or day, depending on the nature of the disaster!)  It has to be considered a cute and cuddly superhero series, kid friendly to a large degree (If flash is Doctor Who and Arrow is Torchwood, then Supergirl is definitely Sarah Jane Adventures), it's likable and fun! While I totally disagree with Jimmy    sorry James Olson being a buff black dude instead of a nerdy kid, the character dynamic between Kara, James and Winn works really well  The whole secret government agency thing with Hank  I'm not really Hank  Henshaw and Kara's older (and far hotter) adoptive sister Alex, gives that nice support team feel that I'm sure we've gotten used to with superhero series  Whilst I was initially hoping that CBS and The CW could work out their differences so Kara could go to Star City or Central City (or visa versa) to flesh out her universe, I now don't think there's any need, it would still be cool but not the life preserver that I thought this series needed after the first 3 episodes  Try episodes 4 onwards, if you still can't get on with it then it's obviously not for you  ",7,0.5,7.5,"Positive"
"Supergirl","2015-12-24"," I had a lot of hope for Supergirl  But in short, there are too many insinuations about perceived social injustices, particularly gender issues  Like in the beginning S01E06, where a two male drivers irrationally don't consider the children they were about to run over, and Supergirl gets all the blame for controlling the situation  This is unrealistic in every way imaginable, and it perpetuates the stereotype that men are evil and inconsiderate  In the real world, everyone would have 100% sympathy for her, and probably demand the death penalty for the two men  This show is clearly aimed to please the female demographic, and I can take a hint  I hope it fails miserably  ",2,-1,1,"Negative"

James is too actractive for the sweet innocent girl super girl is  Dialogue is sooooooooo baddddddd, super girl to superman   thanks for saving my life  Sumer man   just spoke to james won't happen again :-)  are you freaking kidding me? She was clearly going to die but still didn't want the help of super man which it seems like she didn't because he is a man because she was fine with her sister helping her  It all tries to empower women ( in a dumb way) while discrediting men  All men are villains except the ones who worship her  Come on now  We all know super man is better than her don't try that bull crap ",1,0.8,1.8,"Negative"

Although I did have a feeling that bloke was John Jones, when they actually revealed him, WOW<U+0085>he looked amazing! Now If only they could fix the rest of this crap filled with horrible acting and terrible affects we could have a show worth watching Honestly, I really have a problem with the cast starting with the lead  I guess I was expecting a Justice League or Superman/Batman: Apocalypse Supergirl only to get a badly written 90210 (after High school) corny watered down version of the character with absolutely no substance instead  All of that hype for this CRAP!

"Supergirl","2015-12-17"," So, first up  I have not read the Supergirl comics  Did read some stuff on the internet  Am pretty much caught up on Arrow, Flash, Daredevil, A o SHIELD (I know the latter two are Marvel) So the first episode is brilliant in the same way that I loved Eureka and Warehouse 13  It's cheesy, it's corny, it's cliché and has caricature characters  Emotions follow up waaaay to fast (and I really mean, waaaay to fast  Have an emotional family reunion and the first tear has barely dried and she wants to fight)  It makes me wanna grab the story, twist in around in my own version  I really like doing that  After that, this level of corniness dwindles down and the quality goes up  Yes, it's not a high quality and there are too many moments that don't add up even when following that universes rules  The amount of times she jumps in her costume when she doesn't need it is remarkably high  Moreover there are many times she speaks of Supergirl like it is a role model and I mean in the ultimate, can't live up to ideal  Or the boss which tries to be strict, bitchy, I-don't-care-bout-you boss, who suddenly takes Kara out for drinks after an outburst  Or how fast a new villain gains powers and immediately masters them in a single hour However, as episodes go on, it improves  Not fast enough to get to the level where Arrow and Flash are, but well enough to have faith this show will continue to be very enjoyable without the need to rely on super corny over the top parts  Even though they are still in there {WARNING, SPOILERS COMING UP} Like its predecessors in the DC universe  More and more characters become fleshed out  Bad guys become gray or even kinda white (as we learn out that HH is in fact JJ/MM) or gray characters become black (Maxwell as the immoral technocrat)  The events in episode 7 are most interesting, especially the part in the DEO basement  Also, miss Grants observance also brings an interesting change, for how long she's been too nice to Kara was starting to get a bit    bothersome  So I'm curious how that's going to flesh out So, are the flaws gone? No  There are plenty of flaws  Plenty of time problems  For instance a call to Supergirl from the DEO office of a break-in (ep 8) yet DEO arrives first  Or location problems: from a busy first aid center to a deserted street in too short time  Or the continuous need to discuss Supergirl to 'strangers' while in Kara form  It's a bit too    self-centered(?) for Kara tbh  So yeah, it has its flaws, and sometimes they're quirks, sometimes they are a bit annoying  But it's all coated in a sugary sweet honey delight of cute innocence and hope  Especially the latter  Hope is important and from what I've seen so far  It gives me hope for an increasingly better series  ",7,0.5,7.5,"Positive"
"Supergirl","2015-12-17"," The thing I really like about the show? They are going with a version of Supergirl that isn't perfect  She carries scars due to her planets destruction (which she remembers) and can be emotional, volatile & complicated  Yet she still manages to retain the fun/light and very strong aspects of her character which shine thru  Melissa is doing a awesome job on the Kara front and settling in to the role of Supergirl even better than I anticipated and I had high expectations from the get go You have to   Whether the show fails or succeeds the main character cannot be one dimensional as we will all go ho-hum and lose interest  I am certainly not the demographic they may be going for on this show    but as a member of the demographic that spawned interest in the superhero genre becoming popular I can safely say their getting it right  There are moments that are simply brilliant that make you want to geek out and loop the hell out of the scene  I was NOT expecting that at all  It's impressive simply because it's reactions you only really expect in very rare instances in movies  Their doing so much right with this show that you can ignore it's minor flaws which are really just a process of discovering what works and what doesn't  The shows not corny or campy, It's good TV!

"Supergirl","2015-12-16"," This is based upon the show's own merit alone, not the established Supergirl history in the DC universe, or how Jimmy Olsen isn't Caucasian, dorky, and freckled enough(give it a rest!)The characters and the chemistry of their interactions are not always the strong point, but do progressively become more natural  There are many stereotypes depicted, though based upon many true life and common realities experienced, (i e  under-appreciated assistants, tyrannical employers, romantically unnoticed best friends,secret government agencies etc ) The best part of this show however is its self-awareness (why Super  girl ? isn't the real problem you?) and being a fantasy/Sci-Fi platform for bringing to the table further discussion of Women  The most under-appreciated half of the species  The exploration of concepts like how to be an independent successful Woman/Female superhero, while trying to remove yourself from the shadow of comparison to a man (Superman) is unparalleled, and extremely relevant in the superhero TV genre   Just because you wear that symbol on your chest doesn't mean you're him  Fighting him would be an honor  This is exactly what the average Girl, boy and viewers in the U S (and beyond) needs, an empowering Female fronted symbolic message for all Girls that shows even with their flaws, constant struggles, and being undervalued or taken less than seriously in a male dominated world (or TV world Arrow, Flash,Gotham)they can in fact make the world a better place, hold their own, and be more as a Girl or Woman than even a superman I find that the harsh critical response echoes the popular sentiment and even the shows message, how can a show be taken seriously when revolving around a Female superhero, how can Supergirl be taken seriously in its own right if there are successful male fronted shows doing the same thing? The struggles of both Girl and Woman were never more relevant than now! ",9,0.3,9.3,"Positive"

"Supergirl","2015-12-16"," I'm mostly writing this review to offset the bad ones all over IMDb that have mostly been written after watching 2 or 3 episodes I love how this show is done  For once, female characters get to rule and the boys get to sit on the sidelines  After watching Arrow, Flash, Gotham, Agents of SHIELD and Agent Carter with great interest, I can say that only Flash and Agent Carter have held my interest from episode to episode and improved with each Supergirl started out as corny and a rip off of Superman (pick any movie or TV series) however I enjoy how it keeps the show character driven and is ultimately about Kara's journey  For a girl who was sent off by her mother just as she was turning 13 (the start of some very tough years for both genders), Kara has so much to learn  And you can see that in episodes 1,2,3,4    yes all of them  No matter how much time she's spent here, she's still an alien in the truest sense and unless she's forced to learn something new and evolve, she just seems to exist and float around - not really living I also like how the show is obviously feminist  They are not trying to hide it  Calista Flockhart as Cat Grant has possibly the best lines on the show and never fails to deliver  Chyler Leigh as Alex is the big sister who shifts from being overly protective to being downright mean at times  But then this is how any 'sister' relationship would be if after 15 years of being an only child you get a super sister  And last of all Laura Benanti in the role of aunt Astra / mom Alura is just brilliant  Their latest showdown in 'Ep 8- Hostile Takeover' was absolute perfection  Fight scenes were well done (yes we could all see there was a hidden agenda), confrontations & flashbacks with both Kara in Krypton & Earth with her aunt and mom were simply spectacular and well acted by both actresses So whats not to love? You can tell the inner demons, family and workplace drama are enough to drive this show without having Kara fly around National City playing hero I also like how the writers are staying true to characters created for this TV universe  For all future & past fans of the show, do not expect a comic book reincarnation  I'm glad they are not following any of it because really 90% of any super shows' audience do not read comics  So why not make it your own especially when you know its in its own 'pocket super hero universe' ",9,1,10,"Positive"

"Supergirl","2015-12-13"," This review is written just before the airing of season 1, episode 8  Unlike quite a few other reviewers who trashed this show on the basis of the pilot only, I decided to see how the show and characters progressed  This is basically a reboot of the Supergirl story  The pilot was not the best that I have seen but I must say that it is improving as it goes on  The characters are maturing and the story lines are passable but not great While reading through previous reviews, I was stunned by some of the very negative comments  Some people criticized the show because it does not follow the historic comic book story lines but they then compare it unfavourably to The Flash and Arrow, neither of which follow the comic books either  So why condemn this show but praise the other 2 ? Considering the original Supergirl was set in the 1950's & 60's it is not surprising that the producers decided to update the whole thing to the current era, after all Jimmy Olson would now be at least 75 years old (a bit old to be a photographer for a modern magazine) and changing him to an African-American is not such a hard thing to come to terms with considering how racist the comic book was (the vast majority of non-Caucasians were villains and nearly all humanoid heroes were Caucasian) I am enjoying this version of Supergirl and was very pleased with the choice of actors for her adoptive parents, great nod to past shows  I even watched Helen Slaters Supergirl movie again  ",7,0,7,"Positive"
"Supergirl","2015-12-09"," Let me start by saying I love Melissa Benoist, she is so dam cute, in fact, the only reason I started watching this is because of her in a SuperGirl suit    but    that's about it The pilot episode was an infernal mess, where do I start   The characters are horrible depicted, they don't have any progression whatsoever and the lines are said like they are reading from a cardboard, they don't act their roles    at all   this is some serious bad writing/directing in place The Pilot goes from being an idiot to a super girl to beating a villain to joining a secret organization in just 40 minutes, they tried to crunch so much into so little time that character development went to trash  The second episode didn't improved either, in fact, it made it worse, the only thing bearable from this series is looking at the gorgeous Melissa wearing that hot sexy super girl outfit but, believe me, that's about the only thing you can do on this series, nothing else makes sens, the second episode even have bad editing and camera work, you can clearly see cut scenes where the actors suddenly change positions, even Melissa seems distracted all the time and there are moments when you swear she is looking at the camera !!Horrible miscast, except for Melissa, incredible bad acting, really bad directing and the writer should be fired like    NOW This is a disaster, I don't think it will finish filming season 1 and I'm sad because I still think Melissa was the cutest Supergirl i've seen but she can't do a series by herself if all the team surrounding her is incompetent Skip it, or just watch it if you like Melissa and want to see her in a Supergirl suit to fantasize about it because, frankly, there isn't anything more to do here  ",5,-0.1,4.9,"Negative"

"Supergirl","2015-12-09"," I'm a fairly open minded person and a bit of a  nerd  when it comes to anything related to superheroes  I must say, I was pretty disappointed when I finished watching the pilot of Supergirl  Childish writing, awful special effects, cable work during fights that reminded me more of a Chinese Martial Arts movie from the 70's than something from this century  The bread and butter of a superhero plot is, usually, the struggle to maintain a  secret identity   Well      by the end of the first episode, already two peoples knew who Supergirl was, and this was done like it was the easiest thing in the world     Now    if I'm willing to overlook this, at least, the writers should know that what made shows like  Arrow ,  The Flash  and movies like Dark Knight and Man of Steel so successful, is the maturity of said shows, the darkness that is fully part of the DC universe, but NO     its clear that this show is meant for teenagers that have little to no knowledge of the DC universe  An example? That Supergirl costume       really??? After the amazing Superman, Flash, Green Arrow, Deathstroke, Batman (and I could go on) costumes fans got to see already on screen, they came out with something that could be easily found at Wal Mart      the very concept of  If it's not broken, don't fix it  clearly was not taken in consideration at all  I'm willing to give the show a chance, but some serious changes are needed      ",2,0.4,2.4,"Negative"

But she decides to go into being a superhero over night  She has no idea how to fight, she only throws punches  Because who needs to know anything about fighting if they are super strong right? Her speed of flying is also a big mystery, and her  landings  are just bad  She doesn't inspire any belief or confidence that she can fly And yes, she goes for a journalist of course, nothing new here  The only difference between Supergirl and Kara is, you guessed it, the glasses! And of course no one sees resemblance when they see her standing in front of the poster of the super girl  She even made an interview with her boss as super girl, and didn't try to change voice or anything like that This show is making everybody in it seem stupid  I haven't seen so unoriginal series in a long time  It screams low budget, amateur and poorly written You might want NOT to watch it  ",2,0,2,"Negative"

They took too much liberty in changing the story line  They should have instead added to the storyline instead of changing it  For example, Hank Henshaw was a good addition to the show and the actor who played him does a very good job  But every time there's a scene with Supergirl and Jimmy Olsen, all you really see is awkwardness  ",1,0.2,1.2,"Negative"
"Supergirl","2015-12-07"," I will start by admitting I am a Marvel fan  with that out of the system, I will now elaborate on a few things that bothered me when I watched the show  I will start with the terrible character development flaws  maybe it's because the production had to do a convincing pilot, but everything in the first episode happened too fast  I didn't get to know Kara as a total nerd before she suddenly became a superhero, the show also never introduced Alex as a normal person, so there goes my  surprise  for her being a secret agent  the forced romantic triangle didn't really add anything to the equation  and the bad overacting from about    everyone except Calista Flockhart is the real Deal breaker for me  the  one episode plot  is also something I don't really like in this show but I guess it's an audience thing  I tried giving this show more chances, but the relative ease with which Supergirl deals with older, experienced fighters that are as strong or stronger then her is just unbearable  I really wanted to like this show, I do watch regularly and enjoy Arrow and The Flash, but the CBS really did a terrible job with this show, and instead of focusing on Kara's frustration from spending her years as a girl scout and giving her an interesting dark side, the CBS chose to make her the perfect hero, which as boring as a superhero show could get  ",3,0.2,3.2,"Negative"
"Supergirl","2015-12-06"," Arguments about any  feminist  agenda aside, my problem (and my family's) is that the show is very poorly written and produced Action sequences are lame, relationships are absolutely pubescent, characterization is poor, and on and on The effects in combat scenes are poorly done  Worse, the action is ridiculous  Case in point #1: two people using  laser vision  against each other  The strike in the middle as if they were quarterstaves, and when they move the rays are deflected upward to strike a beam  Light doesn't work like that; if two lasers (or flashlights!) are pointed at each other, the light passes through the opposing beam and strikes whatever it's aimed at  Case #2: Supergirl gets struck in the chest by another bean and is blasted backward like a shot, but ripping off a car door and holding it in front of herself completely stops the same beam  There are far too many other examples to list Kara is what, in her late 20s? She acts like she has a 12-year-old's crush on one guy, giggling stupidly and looking awkwardly, while completely missing the signs of another potential paramour  She is completely cowed by her boss (ok, maybe I can let that one go), but should be far more self-assured considering the show's constant feminist leanings  She has lived 15 or more years on Earth already; she should be past that stage in her life Supergirl doesn't ever let go in combat even when she's literally being killed  She KNOWS she has the same abilities as her cousin, but at one point he has to show up and simply stands before her attacker and ignores the same attack that is killing Kara  How many times must she suffer badly at a bad guy's hands before she thinks  Hey, I'm being killed, perhaps I should hit back hard?  And really    the whole glasses/no glasses  secret identity  is as stupid as it ever was  I mean, anyone who has ever seen her up close (like her boss, duh) in both guises can clearly see the little indent above her left eye, not to mention the smile, the face, etc  To quote a scene from Lois and Clark years ago, it's just  galactically stupid   There are so many plot holes and failures in general that after 5 episodes, my family has chosen not to watch any more  It's a shame, because we REALLY wanted this show to be good, at least on the level of Flash  The Supergirl/Kara character has just as rich a story (in the comics) as Superman, but this show is failing her in a big way  ",3,-1.1,1.9,"Negative"

Anyhoo, I find myself fast-forwarding through any of the scenes with Calista Flockhart, I think with good writing and direction she can do well, but her performance in this is so flat and idiosyncratic (In a NOT good way!) that it is just about unbearable for me  I can imagine very young viewers enjoying it greatly and perhaps if they changed the time- slot to early morning cartoon time it would sit more comfortably  You can have one or two actors with charm, but unless you bounce them around in interesting situations and with other interesting characters, it isn't enough to save a sinking show  I have wondered what it requires to be 'saved', perhaps the death of CF's character, increasing the relationship dynamics between the two charmers (Benoist and Jordan) also using the 'race against time' device a little more and with greater deftness - as she is indestructible so the drama must be milked out of the vulnerability of those around her  Perhaps it is they are trying to appeal to both an adult and an extremely young audience so they never put any real meat on the bones? A pretty tricky situation for this show I think    ALSO - whoever did the music should either be schooled hard or sacked! Sheesh! ADDITIONAL: Now the show has changed hands I have noticed some definite improvements so I will increase my star rating from 1 star     also, every time they include Martian Manhunter the whole show lifts a few notches - the actor is just so darned likable as is the double-sided character he plays  Hooray for TV shows that eventually get their shizz together!

"Supergirl","2015-11-03"," Much like previous shows such as Arrow or Smallville, the beginning of this show seems weak with poor chemistry between the main cast  The writing itself is really well done and the acting is better than most shows, however there isn't chemistry between characters and that makes it cringe-worthy  The special effects and CGI are good and bad  The flying sequences also make you cringe but other than that they are almost as good as those on The Flash  A lot of the fight sequences which occur at night remind me of Arrow which is a good thing and seeing as both shows have the same executive producer it means better things in the future  I also believe that over time chemistry will improve  As for the actual story it is very promising and the execution will also improve  ",7,0.6,7.6,"Positive"

This show has had a slow start, but wow it's starting to come good  People calling it a pro-feminist show need to get there heads out of there rear ends! Just because there is 4 of the main characters as women, does not make it a feminist show  The shows actual style is starting to make it a fun enjoyable, family friendly, yet fairly easy watching show  If your looking for another marvel daredevil style show (a great show btw) then you are sadly mistaken!This show is a bit like the  Man of steel's  attempt to take flight and eventually take flight  Me not being a comic book fanatic, has allowed me too watch this show without having a premeditated opinion  Like the Flash and Arrow, this show has started slowly, but the pilot episode I thought was very intriguing  Plenty of action, yes some cringe worthy scenes, but overall well made  It appears to be coping a lot of hate for not actually doing much wrong  The idea that we need to realise is that the shows and films these days are no longer designed to appeal just too the comic lovers but rather to a wider audience  When I heard this show was coming out I didn't think id give it a go, I would write it off, but now having watched the first 2 episodes it is slowly but surely managing to reel me in, a bit like arrow, which lots of critics and people said was awful  Open mind people that's all that's needed  This show as i said is like the attempts to take flight  It is jumping around, smashing into things, but after the second episode, I think it's managed to take flight, and has started too reveal itself as a great show  8/10 and a recommend if your after a fun enjoyable, show, that is easy watching!

"Supergirl","2015-10-31"," I'm aware that I initially gave lukewarm reviews first-up to now established favourites of mine  Arrow ,  The Flash  and  Gotham  from the expanding DC TV universe, so I'm wary of taking too much from first impressions  I do think though that putting a fully super-powered character into a TV series is a harder sell than a no-power or single-power character, due to the former's sheer omnipotence, plus of course we know what familiarity breeds, i e  when you've seen one red and blue-garbed super-hero who can fly, be strong, invulnerable, etc , etc,   At least this pilot episode gets the origin story out of the way quickly, again perhaps because it so closely resembles her big cousin's, quickly growing up Kara Danvers to adult or at least early adult-hood and putting her in a similar job to Clark Kent's (and Peter Parker's come to that) on a newspaper  Jimmy, sorry James Olsen gets a PC makeover a la Iris Allen in  The Flash  as well as obviously migrating to Metropolis to keep an eye on the emergent heroine as well as boost character recognition for the keen viewer  We're also quickly introduced to the Phantom Zone villains who will no doubt form the continuity theme for the series, whilst new characters such as her super agent stepsister, her Diggle-type boss plus a kooky love interest boyfriend (Cisco, anyone?), look like they'll form the back-up team, again just like Arrow and The Flash  The biggest drawback is undoubtedly going to be the awful Calista Flockhart who must have watched the  Confessions Of A Shopaholic  movie, and only that, a hundred times to research her part as Kara's female J Jonah Jameson-type newspaper editor  I doubt even Supergirl's super-strength could force a perceptible emotion out of her Botox-straightened features The special effects were okay, but the few attempts at humour fell fairly flat  The acting was just so-so too and I'm struggling to pick up either any cuteness or personality in Melissa Benoist as the title character and fear she may go the way of Helen Slater, who by the way, it was nice to see in a cameo role as the mother of the character she herself played in the ill-fated movie years ago (repeating a neat casting trick employed in  The Flash  with Barry Allen's father) I do hope it improves but unlike  Arrow ,  Gotham  or even  The Flash , I can't see much opportunity for some dramatic weight to the story-lines to come  I'd like to be proved wrong even as I appreciate the show may perhaps be reaching out to a younger, possibly more female-based audience than the three other shows I've mentioned, but I still think that this particular series may struggle to stay up in the air, unlike the Supergirl character herself  ",4,0.1,4.1,"Negative"
"Supergirl","2015-10-31"," A mixed start, perhaps because setting up characters in a pilot is a tricky process  Melissa Benoist lead has a bright enough personality for the part and the storyline has an interesting feminine approach  Perhaps turning the Superman story upside down was not the best move as an outline but it does paint a picture as to how things may develop Measured against other mainstream teen appeal TV is faces big competition and the reality of competition is that it really has to score points very early on in a series to catch the audience  It's glossy and up to date, runs quite smoothly and quickly action wise, is well produced but I wonder if it will catch on  Too early on to predict after the pilot but I wish it well  I'll watch it again and that doesn't happen with all series Recommended to sample  ",6,0.8,6.8,"Positive"

"Supergirl","2015-10-30"," Any time there is something new, a re-imagining, if you will, there will always be those who say that it's not worth it  This is what I feel is really going on here In my view, the main reason so many people are hating Supergirl is because they're used to having the title character grow up in Superman's shadow  She'd always been  Superman's cousin,  never really given her own way to grow up into the character Sure, having her stuck in the phantom zone was a bit of a stretch, but going with the continuity of having her grow up, basically, on Earth as a younger cousin, because, as it says in the pilot, time doesn't pass in the PZ, gives her something that no other Supergirl had before Before, she was always someone who followed in Superman's shadow, someone who was just thought of as a female Superman  Now, Supergirl is her own character, written in such a way that she's growing into who she is supposed to be  She is a full hero in her own right, not just a girl who's like Superman As per her connection to James Olson, there is no reason at all that she and James can't have that kind of relationship  It shouldn't matter at all, for any reason, that James can be in the story in the way he is If you're looking for a female Superman, or if you're saying that it can't be good if it doesn't follow one of the  established story lines,  then you will be disappointed  But, if you want to see a story of a female superhero who is growing into herself, learning about what she can do while facing the same fears and doubts that every woman feels at some time in their lives, and wondering who she really is, just like every person has ever felt, someone who definitely isn't Superman but can exist without his influence, then this show might be worth the watch  ",10,-0.1,9.9,"Positive"

"Supergirl","2015-10-30"," In the last couple of years I have seemed to have gotten bored with TV series  I miss House and The Mentalist  To catch my attention, a series has to be considerably better than average  For a few minutes I thought Supergirl might be that series  Maybe it will be, but after the pilot, I sincerely doubt it  I like the Supergirl character well enough  I wouldn't have gotten by the first commercial if she had been macho  In fact, I like all of the main characters  Unfortunately I released an audible groan when it became apparent that Supergirl would be fighting an alien super villain  That has been done before  If the super villain were interesting, if he had a silly sense of humor, for example, then it could still work  Sadly, the pilot's super villain is garden variety and therefore boring  He growls like the standard bad guy professional wrestler and expresses pretty much the same evil sentiments  It could be that these types of series just will not work anymore, at least not anything long-term  But who knows, maybe in the coming episodes something new and special will be added  I might go one more episode, or perhaps just part of one  Like I said, for a series to really catch my attention it has to be above average  The Supergirl pilot was not bad, it just was not above average  ",6,0.5,6.5,"Positive"
"Supergirl","2015-10-30"," Spoilers, Supergirl starts with a rushed introduction, Kara is given about 25 seconds of back-story of her time on krypton  Instead they skip to her being the stock un-empowered female who must overcome her insecurities as a woman  Again <U+0085> let me clarify, an infinitely powerful alien superhero has been re-envisioned to be the standard girl meets world, who has to go and find her inner confidence  Okay! Okay screw it! She didn't land on earth, oh no! We have officially landed on the planet of fruit loops and tap dancing mega penguins! I don't remember much about jimmy Olsen so I don't personally have an opinion, but on principle it's a bad idea to completely change a preexisting character  Kara acts like a star struck teenager the whole episode  The show poorly imitates superman's first flight and show also leaches off of superman constantly  Then even rips off the opening of superman returns  The show treats the audience like they are all basically children  On top of that the entire episode is completely incoherent  This single episode focuses on at least 8-10 plots  Leaving the viewer confused about life and probably a little scared  The lead character is the average geek girl with the intelligence of a teenager and is basically a cookie cutter cut out  The acting is horrible and doesn't convey anything that would make these characters seem like believable people, except Kara's sister  All of the character's traits are overdramatized like a cartoon, again because the company assumes it's audience it too stupid to notice anything unless it talks down to you  The dialogue is either cliché or political  At least Kara's sister is actually the only character so far act like an adult, but the rest act like idiots Finally, the show constantly crams self-defeating and off topic feminist speeches and empowerment messages down your throat  Good female characters don't ever have to point out that they are female or make speeches about their power  If a character is good, you never care that the character is female or male  The music is loud, obnoxious, and distracted from any dialogue or potential atmosphere  At least the FX were OK sometimes, but they need a lot of polish  There is no emotional conflict because there are no believable or relatable characters  The fights are good, the only problem is that the show crams in a bunch of comic relief and one liners like Michael Bay SUGGESTIONS: This isn't the first failed teeny show this company has made, and teeny shows are the only type this company creates, except supernatural  Start by not ruining a preexisting story and branch into other target audiences, You may be making money off of these shows now, but the best way to gain ratings and money is to make your shows unique and worth while in their own right  Because what you fail to realize is that your audience is not as retarded as you think, and not only preteens watch your channels  Focus on smarter, and believable characters  They should be more capable of avoiding obvious mistakes, clever, and basically not being teenagers so they can  grow up/develop   As for this show, start over, if there were a completely different show, with different casts and story lines, I would still try it, and if it were good I would continue watching it  Cancel this current show then in a couple years, start over from complete scratch  Suggestions for Kara: In the superman cartoon, Kara was a more wild teenage girl  That was better than this current show because Kara had a believable reason to have a rough, and have an uncontrolled personality  Her parents were killed, she will never see her home again, and she had to learn to survive in a chaotic alien world, no kid would be unscathed  The first couple of episodes can start with how she grew up and use maybe a few time lapses (NOT FLASHBACKS) of her first 5-8 earth years, and show as much well-paced detail as you can  Then transition to the main story with her still being still young, probably still somewhat a teen, but don't make her an idiotic brat  Also try a two episode premiere so you don't rush  Try a tone that is more like supernatural, not whimsical, maybe not brutal, but realistic  Kara should be smarter and more resourceful, and not entirely rely on brute force, but don't make it the standard flash formula, the flash fails with idiotic brute force so the team convenes and comes up with a convoluted plan that works just in time for the end of the episode  Also instead of the main characters having some generic character flaw like  un-empowered , and instead of having everyone else preach to Kara and give her obvious advice, have Kara also be the one giving advice of advice to the other characters Finally try having her be more street smart or stealthy, but maybe still has to learn patience, but this is just preference  ",4,0.2,4.2,"Negative"

I enjoyed how it fit into the established Superman universe and has opened itself up to a lot of villain potential  Melissa Benoist is quite believable, and apart from the necessary sappy references to Superman (to establish the character) it is something worth watching  ",8,0.5,8.5,"Positive"
"Supergirl","2015-10-29"," I'll admit it wasn't terrible, but the first episode gradually got worse as it progressed  I'm not going to go over specifics, but here are the problems I have with the  Supergirl  so far:1) Melissa Benoist:Since was one of the few actresses who was looked at for the role, even though she doesn't have a creditable filmography, it was most-likely because she's blonde  She clearly didn't do that great of a job playing  Kara Danvers  (even though the actual alias of Kara Zor-El is Linda Lee Danvers) or as Supergirl  While her clumsiness and being a typical office intern is a decent disguise at first, it doesn't last long when she decides to show off her powers to the guy at the office who tries to ask her out on a date  It would've made more sense if the two had chemistry for a good 4-5 episodes, he soon develops suspicions of her alter-ego, causing him to figure out that she is Supergirl  On top of that, she treats her  heroism  almost like a game and doesn't understand the weight of her role as a heroine  She also doesn't bother to get superheroine training (so she would know how to be one and use her powers effectively) and throws together a crappy costume and claims that makes her Supergirl (instead of having her costume come with her in her pod)  Any superhero(ine) would have trained themselves, or got training from a master, and she gets defeated multiple times as a result  Clearly she wasn't a good choice 2) The rest of the characters are out of character:While Allura seemed okay, Jimmy Olsen isn't nerdy like he is the comics (and he's a photographer for the Daily Planet, not an art director for some company that doesn't have any relation to the comics), and Kat Grant is a narcissist who now supposedly owns her own media company  Superman only makes a cameo, and you'd think he would've shown up when he heard Kara had saved the people on the plane  The rest of the other characters have no back story, and seem like they're just thrown into the episode so the writers could add more characters 3) The show barely follows the comics:It seems like the people who made the show decided to simply plaster Supegirl's name on it, and acted like they knew the character  Just like the 1998 Godzilla movie, they were more interested in the title, not the character  I don't know what kind of drugs they were on to think it would be a good idea for Fred and Edna Danvers (who are now named  Jeremiah  and  Eliza ) to only have a cameo, and instead have some made up sister named Alex has a lot of screen time  I also don't know why there's supposedly some secret government organization that deals with alien invasions  The writers could only be on cocaine if they thought that was good idea 4) It's  fun  and  light-hearted , instead of being epic and deep:Regardless of what your opinion about Man of Steel is, the people who made that movie portrayed Clark Kent/Superman as a powerful god-like being  Nowhere is there an understanding of that in Kara's character, or in the episode itself  If that was included in the episode, and Kara had to make several hard choices in the episode, she would understand her role as a superheroine, because of the emotional weight it bares on her, and it would make her character more likable  It would also make the show more grounded instead of flimsy and quickly thrown together I'm not here to promote anything, but these reasons and more are why I immediately thought of making my own version so I can improve it  I'm not one of those people who rant about a show or movie, and then allow the idiots and Hollywood continue to run rampant  As a member of the audience, I'm entitled to stand up to Hollywood if they're going to act lazy, greedy, or careless  If anyone who wants to help me make my own version, click on my name and message me  ",2,0.4,2.4,"Negative"
"Supergirl","2015-10-29"," The adventures of Superman's cousin in her own superhero career  Supergirl is the latest DC Comics adaptation from producers Greg Berlanti and Andrew Kreisberg  Taking a page from The Flash and Smallville before it, the series also seeks to establish via Kara's origin tale a deeper mythology and an excuse for Earth to be populated by various super-beings  Supergirl arrived late in the booklet of comic book super-heroine that emerged after Wonder Woman in 1941  Though in the 60s she was a supporting player in the Superman family of titles  Until getting her first dedicated series in 1972  She has seen some reboots, pushed by publishers to diversify themselves  Did you know there's now a female Thor? A female Hawkeye and Spider-Gwen? This introductory hour holds closely to that pair producer's formula for The Flash, elevating an adorable Glee cast (there Grant Gustin, here Melissa Benoist) to a costumed-icon status  I'm glad Supergirl exists and I really want it to succeed  It's more than fine with me if it never becomes more than a solid superhero genre show with a female lead - especially since that lead is fantastic  Although Melissa Benoist is not unknown (especially to Glee viewers - like me - who made it past season 3) she's one of those rare casting miracle  She nails the title role: handling very well her dual role, it creates hope for the show going forward  Perfect casting  Her performance embraces, internalises and sells the character's contradictions and paradoxes  Melissa makes Kara feels real, she wears the costume proudly and easily while embodying joy and complexity all at once  Moreover, Calista Flockhart as the central character media mogul boss, Cat Grant, gives the show a Devil Wears Prada vibe  The first super-heroic act is a plane rescue that vaguely echoes the original Christopher Reeve's Superman  As in that movie there's a scene of exultation in which Kara explores her powers after so many years trying to blend in and be normal  A central idea in Superman's origin is that he is super not because of his powers, but because of the character cultivated by his parent  Here we're introduced to the Danvers, scientists and former TV show Superman father Dean Cain  Knowingly engages gender issues, including about the representation of women in pop culture  It's something rare: a superhero series that isn't about a superman  Indeed, writers smartly fit Supergirl's origin story to a very current feminist theme: that women must overcome being socialised to say sorry, o put themselves second or to efface themselves  Rather delivers its message with an enthusiastic bluntness that hearkens back to its comic roots  The name  Supergirl  is ultimately explained, seeking to deflect any charges of sexism about the  girl  designation  The most meta scene comes when Cat Grant coins this name and defends it to Kara , who tries to argue that perhaps  SuperWoman  would be a more appropriate and respectful name   I'm a girl  says Cat,  and your boss and powerful and rich and hot and smart  So if you perceive  Supergirl  as anything less than excellent, isn't the real problem you?   The argument she makes is debatable but worth having  Finally, Supergirl could be filling a shameful void after Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Veronica Mars  That needs to be followed by more contemporary properties such as (hopefully) the upcoming Netflix series, Marvel's Jessica Jones  In a field long dominated by men, Supergirl provides a superhero roe model for girls and young women while symbolising values anyone could admire   Can you believe it? A female hero  Nice for my daughter to have someone like that to look up to   Yes that is nice  Now we need more  Overall, finding the right star and building a credible pilot are big parts of the battle  Thanks to those strengths if the producers can sustain the playfulness and action without going overboard, there's reason to believe this  girl  can fly  ",8,1.4,9.4,"Positive"

This show was so bad I found myself laughing through half of it  The kind of laughing you do when someone tickles you; and as much as you want it to stop (because you're not enjoying it) you can't because you have no choice  CBS left me no choice but to hate this show  The writing, the characters, the plot, all of it just screamed: HELP ME!!! Sorry, but if this show lasts in prime time for more than a month, CBS should be ashamed of themselves  I know it's all about ratings, but if by some miracle Supergirl manages to secure high viewer ship over the coming weeks, I still think they should show some modicum of self respect by taking the video files out back, shooting them, and making sure no backup copies exist  Putting shows like this on in prime time is tantamount to drastically lowering the standards of standardized tests; essentially making us ignorant and lazy in our creativity  If Supergirl MUST remain on television, perhaps it should air on Saturday mornings where children's entertainment thrives  ",1,-0.4,1,"Negative"

She could still work for the same media empire and wouldn't have to rely on a police scanner on a coffee table For a show cocooning itself in feminist armor, though, the worst violation also happened to be a major plot point  The major turn at the end of the second act sees our hero ASKING PERMISSION to be a hero    from the director of a shadowy government agency    an alpha male  I can't recall of another origin story where the titular hero had to ask to be ungrounded so they could go save the day  Perhaps the marketing department thought this was too assertive Corporate thumbprints are all over this pilot  Odd product placement (whiskey featured in a show aimed at families?), retread reveal so lame they put a lighthouse on it (the plane crash), and my favorite, a front-runner for the Heartless Legal Team of the Year at WB for not allowing any mention of the words  Superman  or  Clark Kent  My concern is the network will keep up the monster-of-the-week recipe they've established so clearly in the pilot  That will get old  Fast  Also troubling is the  friendzone  relationship they have going with their Superfriends (but  we're not calling ourselves that anymore )  Get the guy or move on I gave this four stars because I see potential IF they loose the shackles  Show Supergirl standing up to the superspies and have them follow her lead  Deal with the fugitive round up, or at least make them interesting  I'm thinking space plague harmless to Earthlings  Perhaps Calista Flockhart could remind Melissa Benoist how much guff Ally McBeal didn't take, short skirt and all  And for goodness sake, give Dean Cain some lines  The ironic humor in having him deliver fatherly advice could be a goldmine  ",4,0.1,4.1,"Negative"

"Supergirl","2015-10-13"," First of all, i might say a lot of negative things in this review, but i'd like to assert that so far, i like the show just fine! It's got some good humor, the characters are fun (even if the acting is, at times, a little stiff), and the story captured my attention enough that I went to look up the second episode immediately even though i knew it wasn't going to come out for a few weeks yet! Nonetheless, I do have some things that did bother me One of my main problems was how thick they laid on the feminism  As a feminist, I did actually agree with everything they said, but the best way to showcase your ideals is not to throw them in a viewer's face, but to demonstrate them  Show, not tell  The design of her costume and the presentation of it--awesome! The way there's almost constant  what, you think she can't do it because she's a /woman/? well you're wrong because LOOK AT HOW FEMINIST WE ARE!!! -- please don't patronize me  If i were to describe their attitude in one word, i would probably say either  defensive  or  aggressive   Maybe both  It's the same as in one of those pretentious over-the- top environmental films that tries to make its point by throwing nature in your face and demonizing man instead of just showing you the beauty of nature that we're slowly losing  You don't have to be aggressive about it--if you act like her being a superhero woman is normal, viewers will see a superhero woman as normal In relation to this point, we move to the combat, probably my least favorite part of the pilot episode  For a pilot episode, they presented Kara with a particularly powerful opponent  He was strong, was able to injure her (which could have been a bigger deal and an interesting dilemma if they had brought that in after at least a few episodes), and clearly overpowered her on many occasions  In the first episode, you really want to showcase the ability of your protagonist, especially in a superhero show  You make your protagonist impressive  It would have been much cooler if we got to see Kara tossing her opponent around like a rag-doll in the first episode  I want to see her pick up a guy and throw him fifty feet  I want to see her punch a man through a concrete wall without breaking a sweat  I want to see her land before her opponent before a fight and leave a crater where she set foot  I want to see her shoot lasers like a policeman shoots a gun  I want to see her be /AWESOME/  What i got however, was an opponent so strong that her powers seemed almost useless  So strong that she seemed to be at the strength of an almost normal human while she fought with him  I want to know why I felt almost like her powers were sort of run-of- the- mill even though they repeatedly assured us that she was just as obnoxiously strong and fast as Superman? It was actually really not fun to watch her be repeatedly thrown to the ground, repeatedly overpowered; to see her repeatedly have to use words to get her opponent to lower his guard so she could regain the upper hand  I'm tired of seeing a woman have to use her head to beat a man  I want Supergirl to be able to plow through her opponents just like Superman  I want to see Supergirl just go in blind like an idiot and come out as the victor for once, instead of having to forcibly be taught that she  can't win just with pure strength like men can   I want to see her overpower him with little effort  I want to see her kick his butt to next Sunday  I want to see her strong and confident and not needing to think her way out of a bad situation because /she's strong enough that she doesn't get into the bad situation in the first place/  Getting kicked around and overpowered by her opponent should be a obstacle in later episodes  Finding that maybe she does need more training should be for later, when she's become maybe a little overconfident in her abilities  Showing her feeling lost of hopeless and considering giving up should be halfway through the season, not in the first episode  Some of the best elements of a Superhero show were used up in the first episode  Everyone we currently care about already knows she's Supergirl, so we don't get to wait in hope that that one character that doesn't know, will find out about it  The becoming disheartened about abilities and coming back stronger than ever was used up  We already see the face of our current greatest adversary, and even more disappointing, we even know who they are and what their goal is, removing all mystery  It's just a little underwhelming For a show that's so aggressive about how feminist it is, it sure comes up shockingly short in the parts that really matter in showcasing that belief  Overall, there are a lot of things about this show that I don't like, however, I still want to see more  I'm still sucked in to the story  I'm still anxiously awaiting episode two  I'm still looking forward to where the story will go and how it will improve  Supergirl is obviously not perfect, but we also can't really judge a show by its pilot episode  And thus, with an optimistic attitude, I look forward to episode two!

"Supergirl","2015-08-13"," Kara Zor-El, or Supergirl, is the daughter of Superman's uncle Zor- El and his wife Alura  Due to the fact that Krypton was dying, Kal El (Superman), and Kara Zor-El, were sent away to Earth where they could thrive and survive  Though both were sent so they could live, Kara was also sent to protect Kal-El; however, just as her pod was leaving Krypton's atmosphere, the planet exploded and the shockwave sent her pod off course into the Phantom Zone, a prison dimension used by Kryptonians  This prison dimension was originally discovered by Jor El, Kal El's father, and used by the Kryptonian Council as a humane prison  Although the zone is a barren wasteland, people trapped in the zone cannot grow old or die  As a result of being trapped in the Phantom Zone, Kara arrived at planet Earth several decades later only to discover that her cousin, Kal El, whom she was supposed to protect, was a full grown adult called Superman  After being adopted by the Danvers family, Kara slowly follows into the footsteps of her younger cousin as both a journalist and a Superhero known to the world as Supergirl Unlike other DC television series that have a darker and violent atmosphere that might be unappealing to some,  Supergirl  is a cheerful, action packed series that is both entertaining and amusing  That being said, it would have been nice if Supergirl's look were a little more modernized to match her appearance in the NEW 52  Although there are a few cheesy moments, Kara's innocent, energetic, quirky, playful personality makes  Supergirl  enjoyable to watch  In the end,  Supergirl  is a fun and interesting series that has excellent potential  That being said, the acting needs some improvement as the cheesiness of the show can sometimes come across as fake, or amateurous  Additionally, the writers as well as the researchers need to get there facts straight as a native citizen of the planet Krypton is a Kryptonian and not a  Kryptoniese   As for those of you disliking it from just the pilot episode, you should examine/recognize this shows potential as there are a lot of amazing TV shows that had a rocky start  ",7,0.1,7.1,"Positive"

"The Flash","2017-06-24"," THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSIn season 1 I didn't have a show I really like but then Tge Flash came along and instantly captivated me with the characters and story line  The plot twists were fantastic and the writing was on point  Overall that season is 10/10 Unfortunately, Season 2 couldn't keep it that way, it became confusing at points  A prime example of this was the episode  The Reverse Flash Returns  in which they attempted to explain what the heck a time remnant was, something I still have trouble getting my head around, it is also now used for plot convenience  Zoom was a decent villain up until he was unmasked which made him less frightening, plus his backstory sucked, he didn't really have a reason to be a villain  The acting was still good though thankfully, although another downside was Wally he was extremely annoying for many of his episodes  Overall an 8/10 This trend of declining quality continues in season 3, with a highly disappointing Flashpoint episode  The first half of the season was incredibly boring, the writers pretty much took the characters and made them opposite of who they are  Cisco was depressed and hated Barry for the first half making it really stink  Not to mention Barry was depressed and angsty the entire season  One positive was Killer Frost but even that had issues because why the heck does she have to be evil? Many things were left unexplained  This season also has ANOTHER speedster villain in Savitar the self proclaimed god of speed  He pretty much looked like the live child of Sauron and Megatron  Then the writers decided to wait until the final four episodes to reveal Savitar's identity, and at that point nobody cared  Now some major spoilers begin  The reveal that Barry's time remnant was Savitar was so stupid to be honest, after he was revealed he was seen for five minutes outside of the suit towards the beginning of the following episode  And didn't show up for a bit later  Not to mention HR, the newest Wells, he was extremely annoying and over the top  Then there was WestAllen, something I felt bogged the season down a bit  Tracy Brand now has really no purpose in the show now too so why did they really need to bring her on? Tom Felton though was the best thing in this season, he was great until his character became Caitlin's new love interest  I could go on but overall I give the season a 7/10, the musical episode saved the season from a 6/10 The show is by all means entertaining but it has a problem that they always try to top the previous season, thus bogging down the entire season  The show is overall an 8/10 ",8,-0.4,7.6,"Positive"

Also,I can't believe how many villains get into Star-lab and how they don't have any measures to prevent attacks? Flash can't prevent anyone to shoot innocents from 3 meters range, but he can stop bullets when Joe tried to shoot  Reverse Flash  double?

"The Flash","2017-05-01"," Without a doubt, The Flash is an accomplished series with great writing, direction and acting  It does seem like it was made by fans, for fans and regardless whether you like superhero stories or not, or maybe you're a sci-fi fan or not, the core of the series is the great story-telling and the characters; you will enjoy it  Anchoring the ensemble cast is Grant Gustin who has quite the acting range; the man has talent and he wears the role of Barry Allen with great panache  Other main cast members are equally strong, with Tom Canavagh (Harrison Wells) filling in multiple roles throughout 3 seasons, Jesse L Martin (Det  Joe West) as the father figure, Carlos Veldes (Cisco) and Danielle Panabaker (Caitlyn) as the adorable nerds of Team Flash  But the driving force of the series are the writers, who somehow crammed decades worth of Flash comic material into 3 seasons so far with near masterful execution, focusing the theme of what it means to be a hero; the tragedy of it, the choices made and their unintended consequences - all while traveling through time and dimensions Commenting on other reviewers that gave this show a low score; true, this isn't Breaking Bad, nor is it Game of Thrones  Quite possibly these reviewers are looking for something along the lines of Nolan's Dark Knight which will not work for The Flash  As it stands, The Flash is a great superhero series in it's own right  It is fluffy but it has substance  Thoroughly recommended  And yeah, Supergirl is garbage  ",9,0.8,9.8,"Positive"

"The Flash","2017-04-13"," I don't normally write reviews, but after watching most of Flash I just felt compelled to write something  Look, all of these shows are fairly ridiculous and require a certain amount of suspension of disbelief which I'm typically just fine with  Having said that, I do actually find the  Arrow  an entertaining show to watch  After finishing the current available seasons I decided to check out the Flash's stand alone show, despite not being very impressed with the Flash characters when they would cross over into Arrow's world  I tried, I really tried  I consider myself more forgiving than most people when it comes to suspension of disbelief, and I try to watch these shows through a squinted less critical eye  The Flash show though    man, the writing on this show really does need some work  It's unfortunate, because there are some decent scenarios and hints of potential but it almost always gets buried under a mountain of cheese  The tonal consistency is all over the place  The rules of the flash universe seem to be quite flexible or constantly changing  I should also say I am not very taken with the actor that has been chosen to play the flash  He is probably my least favorite character on the show, which is not really a good sign  I find his character development pretty confused, which could be blamed on the writing, but it also feels like the actor playing the flash is equally to blame  I found the character of Barry Allen to grow more and more unlikable, which I don't think was completely intentional  And directly referencing the review title, there are just so many situations and scenes that make you roll your eyes or just down right cringe  There is just situation after situation where the actions taken by the characters, particularly the title character are just so ridiculous and so unrealistic  I realize the show is intended to have a more playful and lighthearted tone than the Arrow, but it also feels like some kind of kids romper room show sometimes in which a bunch of spoiled kids solve every situation by the most dangerous and totally illogical methods  It's difficult to enjoy the show when there is so little logic being employed by the characters  It's difficult for me to sit through an episode of this show without shaking my head or rolling my eyes at it half a dozen times  It's too bad, Flash use to be one of my favorite characters I really hope that this is not the actor that is playing flash in any of the DC movies    ",4,0,4,"Negative"

"The Flash","2017-03-24"," I've only seen the first season so far so I'll comment on it  I'm a fanboy that loves superhero stuff  This series is everything I could want because it captures the spirit of heroism that's so important to any superhero endeavor  If anything Barry is a little too heroic, even apologizing for things that aren't his fault, but that's the kind of spirit the good guys should be about  Though I think he would have been a perfect Peter Parker/Spider-Man, I think Grant Gustin kills it as the Flash  He perfectly captures what it is to be a hero, selflessness (even when it's very painful), compassion and the willingness to risk his life to protect the innocent  That's what heroes are all about and something we've lost in an age where we choose to believe in nothing  Superheroes are all about Utopian ideals; what could we accomplish if we were truly good inside and were motivated by good intentions? We need heroes in our movies and TV and The Flash perfectly captures that  I think Gustin is a terrific young actor because he can express the pain of Barry Allen expertly and that's what's needed for the heroes journey, the choice to serve others at expense of your own goals and dreams  The supporting cast is a bit uneven  Jesse L Martin is excellent and Carlos Valdez gets to be so endearing that certain plot points later on make you upset when things don't go his way  One thing about these CW shows is that the actresses never seen to come off well, just flighty and silly  Danielle Panabaker is fine in her role but Candice Patton's Iris West is a real bubble head  She's the only one the entire first season that can't see the obvious in front or her face  They probably overworked to make her situation with both Barry and Flash as separate entities like Margot Kidder's Lois Lane to Christopher Reeve's Superman  The parallels are virtually identical  Still, if you have to borrow, borrow from something good  Tom Cavanagh is the strongest actor in the series  He handles his complicated part perfectly  The villains are mostly fine though not exactly noteworthy  The exceptions are Reverse Flash (our main villain) and the wonderful Wentworth Miller as old school villain Captain Cold  The special effects are incredible (as they needed to be ) I read a few comments about the show not building a story right away and that's complete nonsense  Barry's creation and evolution as the Flash are juxtaposed with his greatest enemy in his midst without his knowledge (or even knowing he's his enemy yet ) The show builds Harrison Wells as the main villain in Episode 2 so that's pretty much having a direction for the show from early on  And, yes, it's a young Flash so it's going to appeal to younger viewers and that's fine by me  One of the things I loved about the wonderful Batman Begins is that it showed the heroes journey by a young Bruce Wayne into Batman  Heroism comes from the inside and by choice  It's not having superpowers alone  It's what you do with them and The Flash gets that  Hey, I'm a mark for anything superhero but I'm also a mark for good movies and TV  The Flash is a show with millennials in mind and that's fine by me  As an older viewer, I can appreciate it because it captures the timeless beauty of good vs  evil, concepts we should all ponder when we make our choices in life  Loved the first season  Will soon see the second season on DVD and will possibly make another review  ",9,0.8,9.8,"Positive"

"The Flash","2017-01-31"," I've been meaning to check out The Flash for a long time and lamented that it has never made its way to free to air television in Australia  It's been everywhere else but I've had the misfortune to miss out  Finally in December last year I was able to get my hands on Season 1 on Blu-Ray and right from the very first episode, I'd found myself a winner  Every episode was enjoyable to start to finish and I was thrilled to see Grant Gustin perfectly fit into the red suit as The Flash Central City Forensic Police Investigator Barry Allen (Grant Gustin) finds himself blessed with the power of running at super speed following a freak accident which sees him struck by lightening following a massive particle accelerator accident which affected most of Central City and its citizens  Some citizens were blessed/cursed with unusual metahuman powers, and others were killed or seriously injured  Adopting his alternate identity as The Flash, he is taken under the wing of a group of scientists at S T A R Labs led by the Dr Harrison Wells (Tom Cavanagh) and fellow scientists Cisco Ramon (Carlos Valdes) and Caitlin Snow (Danielle Panabaker)  Barry Allen must keep his new found metahuman powers a secret from Detective Joe West (Jesse L  Martin) and Barry's childhood friend Iris West (Candice Patton) who took Barry in as a young age after his father Henry Allen (John Wesley Shipp) was falsely imprisoned after the murder of Barry's mother Nora Allen (Michelle Harrison) 14 years ago Grant Gustin nails it perfectly as Barry Allen/The Flash  Breathing life into the famed comic book character, the TV series has brought upon a new legion of fans who have barely sighted The Flash apart from the various comic books, cartoons, and the short lived TV series in the early 1990's where John Wesley Shipp donned the iconic red tights The best thing about The Flash is that is highly entertaining and lets the audiences sit back and enjoy the fun  Kids and adults alike can get in on the fun as well  I've found a greater appreciation of The Flash and I'm looking forward to see the movie when it hits cinemas in 2018 and this time Ezra Miller will don the famed red tights I've been looking forward to watching The Flash and without having high expectations, it was definitely well worth it  The Flash has been a long overdue (and well deserved) addition to the list of TV series that I enjoy watching 9/10  ",9,0.6,9.6,"Positive"

Everyone that I have ever talked to about the show have all thought it was great, I mean I even got my grandma to watch it and she still loves it till this day  Once or twice a year they also team up with  The Arrow  cast and have cross over episodes which are great to see  Two shows colliding is always fun to watch  So if you are interested in this give it a shot you wont regret it  ",10,0.6,10,"Positive"

Tom Cavanagh played Harrison wells greatly but at first his H  R (Earth-19) was awful  Recommended to watch full season before negative comments!!!

"The Flash","2017-01-01"," If you had asked me a couple of years ago what the best super hero TV show at the time was, I would have said The Flash The show started excellently well with a gripping pilot and a good story line  It starts with how Barry Allen becomes The Flash starting with how he gets his powers, then learns how to use/control them and then tries to solve the mystery of his mother's death to avenge his father  Overall season 1 was superb! Season 2 was weak when it comes to the story line but the excitement of seeing new metas, cross over episodes and 'team flash' developing some individual abilities of their own makes watching the season worthwhile Season 3 has been average at best and my rating of flash that started from a full 10 has dropped to 7 over two years  Constant time traveling and meddling with things not only gets confusing in my opinion, but also makes you lose interest I would definitely recommend people to give this show a go (especially if you are a DC fan) but the eventual and constant decline of the show is pretty obvious as you go on with the episodes  ",7,0.5,7.5,"Positive"

Heroic? More like a spoilt brat in need of a serious slap!! Anyone brought up watching Sci-Fi will understand that when time travelling, changing the past also changes the present  Our 'Super Hero' hasn't quite figured this one out for himself yet  He travels back in time on a few occasions, once again, for his own selfish reasons, only to be shocked to find he's done something to detrimentally alter his own time  OK, doing it once is stupid, but you can sort of make allowances because he's just a kid with a new super-power and he gets carried away with his own importance  After 3 such acts of stupidity, you really have to start wondering just how 'heroic' he actually is!! It's like watching a zombie constantly walking into a locked, glass door  The fact that Barry Allen is so self obsessed, so doesn't learn from his mistakes, just gets boring after a while    especially when he gets all depressed about the effect his actions of having on him, as if the world is working against him!

"The Flash","2016-10-24"," It was hard for me to come up with a sensible review, as there were many things that I enjoyed about this series, but some aspects made me more than irritated when watching  The strong points of Flash are that the show is rather chipper, with lovely Gustin Grant in the lead as Barry Allen aka the Flash  Grant plays well as the nerdy, but cute hero of Central City, who is supported by a small team of experts (nerds) of probably everything science  The team and other main characters have their moments but most of the time, the dialogue is a bit too forced and the acting dull  Especially the mandatory love interest Iris West is the living cliché of a superhero girlfriend, who tends to be both boring and annoying, and it doesn't make it any better that Candice Patton seems to be a woman with only one facial expression  Some character flaws however are mostly due to the bad and sloppy script writing that plagues the show from time to time  Some of the highlights showcasing this aspect include, but are not limited to the following: 1) A big city of millions of people happens to have only two detectives, who solve all the crimes (especially all related to the new emerging metahumans)  2) The 20 somethings run the STAR lab all day everyday, without any other priorities in life  3) Two super criminals have blasters that could freeze/burn all the cops, but they only aim for their shields and not their legs, which are visible  And flash doesn't grab their guns even though he could with his quick feet as other people have pointed out (continuity?)  4) One of the most laughable moments was episode 14, where the cosy twosome of Ronnie/Stein merged in Ronnie's body, explodes, but somehow they both survive and have separated into two different bodies? Their clothes are a little burned, but honestly, if Ronnie didn't turn into a 3D printer during the explosion, where on Earth did Stein's body magically appear from (with glasses and all)? The show has similar kind of goofs, but this was just plain stupid Still, even though the intelligence of the viewer is sometimes underestimated with the aforementioned things, the show is still entertaining if you let things slide  Why, it's hard to tell  Somehow I find humor in the crappy script writing and the poor written characters  Flash itself is an interesting character and I like the cross references they have with the Arrow for instance  And as a lover of the whole superhero genre itself, I can see why this series is getting a strong liking from the fan base as all in all, it's well-intentioned even with all its faults  In conclusion I kind of hate to love this show, but still it's fun to love hating it too  ",5,0.4,5.4,"Negative"

"The Flash","2016-06-17"," I have been quite happy with the Flash until I saw season 2 Episode 18  The writing in that episode is beyond stupidity  Why?- All portals to the other earth were closed  Zoom is fatally sick  In a few years he would die by himself  No real reason to open portal to other earth - Barry is faster than Zoom  Barry captures Zoom but does not knock him out or anything  Instead Barry just talks to Zoom and fails to keep him captured  Also the trap they made for Zoom is stupid  Barry already is faster than Zoom so there was no need for a trap - When Zoom handed over Wally to the Flash team, why didn't Barry just break the deal and kill him or at least knock him out and capture him?  Instead Barry makes the most retarded decision he has ever made  He gives his powers to the serial killer Zoom, who could kill everyone in the earth especially when there is no one to stop him (the Flash is the only one who could stop him) So Barry risks both earths for no good reason  Was he afraid to fight Zoom? Who knows  I hope they don't make this kind of writing mistakes in the future or the Flash is over for me  ",1,-0.7,1,"Negative"
"The Flash","2016-06-16"," I was a little bit hesitant about this in the beginning  The Flash has always been in my Top 3 DC characters and I wasn't entirely convinced that The CW could do it justice Boy was I wrong!This, for over half of the season, has been my favourite new show of the 2014/15 season Every episode from the beginning just got better and better and would always leave me wanting the next week to hurry up and get here The cast is amazing  The three that I always enjoy watching is Grant Gustin, Danielle Panabaker and Carlos Valdes; they are all good to watch on their own but when the three of them work together is always awesome to watch The relationships are another thing I love about this show, most notably between Barry and Joe; the friendship between the two and also the father/son moments, especially in the final episode  Another one would have to be Wells and Cisco in particular towards the end of the season, I actually believe that Wells genuinely liked Cisco and regrets the way things had to go The range of guest stars and characters throughout the season, including the cast from Arrow, were awesome but Robbie Amell and Victor Garber as Firestorm were the highlight for me Another highlight and probably my favourite moments of the whole show; GRODD! Who would think that any show could bring in a telepathic gorilla into a show and not make it look like a joke  I really hope we see a lot more of Grood in Season 2!My least favourite character would have to be Iris  Just really didn't get into watching the character on the screen but the moment when I disliked her the most was, I think it was episode 21 or 22, when Barry told her Wells killed his mother and her reaction was all about Eddie  I get it, your boyfriend has been kidnapped but your best friend has finally found out who murdered his mother and all she could concentrate on was her boyfriend and Barry's lies I love all the DC Comics references throughout the season from Ferris Air, Coast City and Jay Garrick but the awesome thing about these easter eggs is that they don't paint a neon sign towards it saying 'Look here!', it just there for those who know their stuff I am EAGERLY looking forward to Season Two! For me, it's too long to wait!If you're not watching this <U+0096> GET ON IT!************************ SEASON TWO *******************************I absolutely loved the first season so I was eagerly waiting for the new season  While Season Two is awesome, there are starting to be things in the show that I do not like Like Barry Allen! Barry had to be the worst character of the whole season, just so much complaining, whining, whinging and pig headedness  Always running off half-cocked, not listening to the team, screws up and then goes running back to them for help I really hope Barry improves in Season Three because there were some points throughout the season that he was hard to watch Cisco on the other hand; G O L D! By far the best thing about the show and his character got bigger and better this season, still managing to stay the same character and so much more with the addition of his powers  Always on hand to make light of a dark situation without diminishing the importance of the situation I really hope Season Three brings a bigger and better storyline for Caitlin rather than her being in love and ultimately getting hurt  Having said that, I did absolutely love seeing Killer Frost <U+0096> no matter how short it was The relationship between Barry and Joe is still as amazingly awesome as it was in Season One, just so heartfelt and pure  I originally was unconvinced of the idea of bringing back Tom Cavanagh full time but that changed throughout the season and worked really well without rehashing anything from the previous season This season I found Iris and Wally pretty useless, if they weren't in the show; as far as I'm concerned they wouldn't be missed  I felt that they brought Wally in too early to then just have him floating around in the background, he did get a bit more of a story towards the end of the season but that's when they should have brought him in Now onto Zoom  Overall, I have to say I'm pretty disappointed and that has nothing to do with the acting  Teddy Sears was brilliant but I think the writing and the structure of the season let it down I started to get sick of the here and there appearances; in one episode and gone for two  Repeat  In my opinion, I don't think we should have seen Zoom until the last episode before mid-season break or the returning episode afterwards  They should have spent the first half with miscellaneous bad guys from Earth 2 with inklings of Zoom, making him more of a menacing figure and then had his story more compacted through the second half of the show I still love this show, due to awesome dynamic between the cast, I think it's the best of the DCTV universe so I will 100% be watching Season Three  ",9,0.5,9.5,"Positive"

Your guess is as good as mine The scenes were more and more like something out of a badly written soap opera and, somehow, the cast's acting became tackier as well The show has replaced an interesting and captivating story with great plot twists with a god-awful, amateurish crap-fest full of cringe- worthy moments I am so disappointed, it saddens me    ",5,0.3,5.3,"Negative"
"The Flash","2016-06-07"," I enjoy this show more than other CW shows especially in Arrowverse  In season 2 finale, they did twist  barry went back in time to save his mother , which made all things the achievements he did pretty much useless  He could have started his own family; even though, he lost his parents  He selfish to do that didn't even think about what it will do to others  No one else had no say in it, he is pretty much controlling the situation  With that been said, season 3 will most likely cover the Flashpoint storyline, which I am looking forward to  Between this show and legends of tomorrow, they need to follow strict timeline rules, instead, they are bending rules for each show  News flash, the custom rule per shows is ruining both shows (pick one and follow it)  If you went back in time and change small things, it won't effect much, but changing big things, it should have more effect  The world does not revolve around one city (especially changing something small in one city affect the entire world, just NO)  ",9,-0.1,8.9,"Positive"
"The Flash","2016-05-25"," In my opinion, this show started great with a surprising first season, but as the second season came along is like the show- runners and script writers ran out of ideas and started doing random stuff that made no sense whatsoever  The second season had way too many plot holes and continuity errors  Too many things made no sense whatsoever and many other things were left completely unexplained  It was almost as if the both the show- runners and the script writers were changed halfway through the season and they had no idea what was going on with the show  I won't get too much into detail but an example of this was the Zoom almost killing  Jay Garrick  flashback at the beginning of the season  Technically, with what happened later on the show, that NEVER happened since it was all made up by zoom, so why show a flashback to an event that never happened?! A second example was when Zoom killed his Jay Garrick self in front of the team  He arrived with the body at his lair and said  Well, this is a complication  but then like 3 episodes later supposedly it was all part of his plan all along and his Jay Garrick self agreed to being killed  So why, if it was all part of his plan all along and his other self agreed to being killed, why was it a complication? The season already ended and this was never explained  These two things I just mentioned were left completely unexplained and it caused continuity errors with things that happened later that SAME season  They create quite the plot holes as well  But these are just two of perhaps the 10 to 15 things that were left completely unexplained by that season  It is almost as if they just rushed through the script writing without revising it after they were done  They really didn't think things through with this season  Maybe the success of the first season got in their heads and they thought they could just make a bunch of random illogical stuff and people would like it Another thing is that the acting this season felt less natural, like they suddenly forgot how to act sometimes  It bugged me quite a lot, specially with Danielle Panabaker who, in my opinion, had the worst acting this season This does not applies to Tom Cavanagh because he is actually a great actor So yeah, unfortunately, looking at how the second season played out, if in the third season they don't do something to fix all the errors they made in the second season then this show will get nowhere, and if they continue making more continuity errors and plot holes then this show will completely fail  ",1,-0.5,1,"Negative"
"The Flash","2016-05-25"," Wow!! Where do I start about this show  It is truly one of the best shows on TV right now and hands down the best show of the superhero genre  The first 6-7 episodes were a bit slow and honestly they put me off from the show for a bit but boy did it become amazing once that first 'Arrow' crossover rolled around  This show got me interested into the DC universe and now my friends say that I can write a doctoral thesis on DC  Such is the brilliance of this show  The best thing of this show according to me is that it appeals to all audiences and isn't limited to only those people who have read comics  It splendidly establishes the origin story for Barry Allen and explains each detail extremely well  This show shouldn't be looked at as a superhero show but as a Crime show which happens to have superheroes and super-villains in it  The plot twists on this show are to die for  They are such that they can rival those of Game of thrones, arguably the master of the plot twist The special effects of this show are also extremely well done and each VFX sequence seems fluid and not at all clunky  This is very commendable considering that this show runs on a TV budget which is significantly lesser than the budget for a movie  This show is must watch for comic book fans and is well worth a try for regular TV watchers  It has got the full potential to be the best show on TV within the next few years  ",10,0.8,10,"Positive"
"The Flash","2016-05-24"," When I first saw the previews of The Flash, I was convinced this show would be terrible because it felt cheesy  The main actor, Grant Gustin, was relatively unknown and so was most of the cast  I didn't watch the show at first until the Arrow Flash crossover episode was about to air which forced me to watch this show  I am so glad I took a chance on this show  First and foremost, Grant Gustin is one of the best castings for a superhero that I have seen- up there with the casting of Chris Evans as Captain America, Christian Bale as Batman, and Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool  Second, the supporting cast are perfect  Love Cisco almost as much as Barry  The first season was so good, I was counting the days to season 2  This season has been great as well  And you know what makes this show so great?

"The Flash","2016-05-19"," Sry for my English - i am from Germany!I'm still watching this sh  t, just because i like the flash and there are some good animations where he moves fast  I don't have anything against the actors -still they upset me sometimes with the artificial drama  The most annoying is the story - the logical things  They try to force so much science into the episodes but they violate the basic laws of physics at the same time For example: Why must flash punch the giant gorilla with his hand??? Pick a f   g steel bar, speed up to mach-8 and punch the gorilla with the steel bar - that would be clever! Punching the gorilla with the hand on mach-8 is just stupid and you risk damage to the hand, nobody would do that - and you can apply this example to every episode!Then there is  Mr  Cold  or whatever he is called  He is not even a real enemy to the flash  He cant do sh  t against flash with his canon  And why does flash have to run into the ice-cannon and fire-cannon at the same time to defeat the villains? Again do the same trick with the steel bar (like with the gorilla) and there would never be a problem There is something the writers and directors need to understand: The flash is so fast that it is difficult to find a real enemy for him  Still this is the challenge - to find a villain who beats flash with speed or with his cleverness - the reversed flash was a nice try (with his dead again not being logical) No creativity, no logic - just stupid scripts  ",2,0,2,"Negative"

"The Flash","2016-05-15"," In my opinion the show is a good portrayal of the flash, and that's what the show is about It is addressed to a viewer group from 6 years onward so the show contains a naive plot, naive logic  The budget is pretty low, so the action scenes and special effects are not on top level, but satisfying  The Cast is very small but as the story progresses one start to love them  As far as i am concerned it is better than supergirl, arrow or other dc series  So the series makes great sense on its own way  So watch it if you are able rest your brain for 50 minutes, enjoy without awake the scientist in you and endure some e not so compelling scenes  PS It is nearly impossible to write a story(that lasts more than one episode) of the flash( who) without denying the laws of physics, logic and common sense  It is also very very hard to make a villain or antagonist every episode that is as powerful as the flash, because what is as powerful as the fastest man alive besides more faster enemies like reverse flash, zoom(they are already in it, but it would be boring if they were the only villains) or major dc villains like darkside etc So don't put your expectations to high while watching this show  ",8,0,8,"Positive"

"The Flash","2016-05-13"," I'm astonished at the proliferation of high praise for this series  They took a charming cast playing likable characters and ran it into the ground with an onslaught of plot holes and an intolerable inconsistency, with respect to the powers Flash displays  I'll start with the good: I really loved the characters in this show  I found the evolving relationship between Barry and his foster father Joe (expertly played by Jesse L  Martin) to be very touching  There were a couple exchanges between them that miraculously coincided with some dust getting in my eyes, causing them to water  I enjoyed many of the other characters nearly as much Now for the bad:Leaving aside the utter lack of physics, which should be glaringly obvious to anyone who passed 8th grade science, I'll focus on the show's inconsistencies:In some episodes, the flash has trouble with his clothing catching on fire due to the immense friction with the air he generates from running so fast  In one case, he sets a girl down after carrying her along with him at super speed, and she has to quickly tear her shirt off as it had caught fire  Yet in many other episodes, the people he takes with him have no such problems at all  I can only guess they wanted an excuse to put a pretty girl wearing a bra in front of the camera  (not to mention the fact that he accelerates from 0-500mph in about a second   which would be fatal for anyone he was  rescuing )Another glaring example is that in some instances, he is fast enough to dodge bullets and electrical discharges like a character from the matrix but in others, he is unable to dodge a punch from someone who doesn't even have enhanced speed  Human punch: ~25mph  Speed of light: 670,000,000mph  I don't want to sound like I'm being nit picky but the discrepancies are so blatant it's nearly impossible to ignore them and I find myself rolling my eyes in almost every episode  I think one of the key's to enabling an audience to suspend their disbelief in any kind story, but particularly in this genre (fantasy, sci-fi, superhero) is to remain realistic and logical, relative to whatever rules exist for the fantasy world the story is set in  The Flash fails to do this in spectacular fashion  I wanted to love this show and despite all my problems with it, I did finish the whole season  I liked the characters and the story enough that I was able to get through it, aforementioned eye rolls notwithstanding  It's my hope they'll put some more thought into this for the next season as this has the potential to be a good series  ",5,0.4,5.4,"Negative"

"The Flash","2016-04-18"," Barry Allen was introduced during  Arrow  season 2, which was the show in its prime  After setting him up in the universe, they went on to make a show based entirely around Barry Allen becoming The Flash  Since  Arrow  was getting darker and darker,  The Flash  went in the opposite direction  It's the tonal antithesis of  Arrow   Lighthearted, quirky, and silly, yet grounded enough to make us care, and the writing is just as sharp and witty as you'd hope When the characters were first introduced in the  Arrow  episode, I thought I would hate them in  The Flash   But after a few episodes, each character is developed with a certain role in the show, and it works wonders  Harrison Wells as the enigmatic mastermind behind STAR Labs, Caitlin as the straitlaced neurotic scientist, Cisco as the sarcastic pop-culture referencing comic relief who comes up with each villain's  super  name, and Barry Allen as the relatable everyman who was struck by lightning and became the fastest man alive  Then there's Barry's family - journalist Iris West, his foster sister and secret love of his life, and the detective with a heart of gold Joe West, his foster father  The best part is the chemistry between them all  There are clashes between the strict Wells and the snarky Cisco, Barry and Iris' boyfriend Eddie who you're not too sure about at first, and Eddie and Joe West with the usual  you're dating my daughter  dynamic  But none of it comes across as artificial  You believe all of the character interactions because they're developed well enough so that you're fully aware of how each person would react to each situation, and the writers are spot on when it comes to their motivations and actions  The acting itself is surprisingly great  It's refreshing in a CW show to have a likable good actor as the lead, and Grant Gustin knocks it out of the park  He's usually upbeat and quirky but when he's given the important emotional beats, he pulls them off well enough to tug at your heartstrings  Everyone else is great too, even the  freak-of-the-weeks  like Captain Cold played with appropriate coldness by Wentworth Miller  The writing is also excellent for the most part  It takes a few episodes to get going but once it starts up it does not slow down  As the story starts to unravel and the plot slowly reveals itself, it's hard to take your eyes off the screen  There are more than a few jaw-dropping episodes such as the season 1 finale, and superb looking special effects and CGI monsters, namely Gorilla Grodd and King Shark Like  Arrow , there are some soap opera-y moments, but they're placed sparingly enough in the series that they don't take you out of the show  The dialogue is silly sometimes but that's what gives it its charm  It's not supposed to be brooding and gloomy like  Arrow ; it's light and upbeat while still delivering truly awesome comic book moments  And the threatening villains remain threatening - the Reverse-Flash is legitimately menacing, and the tone shifts appropriately for the episodes that he's in  In short, the writing is consistently great while managing to throw a few surprises at you along the way  The Flash  is a must-watch for  Arrow  fans, comic book fans, or action sci-fi fans in general  It's a fun take on the superhero genre and once it hits its stride, it delivers some of the coolest superhero ideas ever explored on TV  Sure, there's some filler, there's corniness  But when it's supposed to be emotional, it is  When it's supposed to be badass, it is  It's not a perfect show by any means, but it delivers on exactly what it sets out to   The Flash  is a blast  ",9,0.8,9.8,"Positive"

Yes  But this is a comic-book show, and comics are cheesy and full of all-too-convenient plot devices  I'm OK with that What I love about this show is that it is (generally) safe for young audiences, with very little objectionable material  My kids are enthralled with every move that Barry makes, and were on the edge of their seats from week to week waiting for the confrontation with Reverse Flash in Season 1 and now Zoom in Season 2 If you're looking for Shakespearean depth, look elsewhere  If you're looking for fun, this show delivers  ",9,0,9,"Positive"

The first 10-15 episodes in season 1 is the same thing over and over again, no storyline is followed: a bad metahuman comes around, barry takes action and takes him down    jeez   this predictability is what you get for excitement A good TV show should have a storyline from the very beginning, I can only imagine how many stopped watching this show early on  It gets interesting with the story of the reverse flash and Barry for a bit, but even then it's mostly fighting bad metahumans, in other words: back to the boring and predictable  When the reverse flash is killed at the end of the season, and season two starts off informing us that there is ANOTHER evil speedster, that was the end for me  The show is so unimaginative  Plus, one might argue the acting could have been better PS: not only are the episodes predictable in terms of action, but many lines as well  ",2,-0.1,1.9,"Negative"

Seriously! A  hero  let the villain kills his mum because   well, no one knows  And the few good fun goofy stuff from the first season which made it watchable is completely gone  In total this is for kids around 8y old, but even they will have a hard time believing what is going on  And I do not mean that in superhero-y way, I mean that nothing makes sense  At all  They change the power of Barry all the time, there are speedsters in every single corner and the acting is so terrible even I could do better  Please do not watch this horrible, terrible, agonizingly bad show  It is almost as bad as Gotham    brr    And for the fan boys who state they love this crap; if you do not complain about a horrible show then all we will get is a horrible show  ",1,-0.1,1,"Negative"

"The Flash","2016-03-28"," When I first thought about watching The Flash's season 1 on Netflix, I imagined a cheesy, childish and Disney-Esq type of show  The first 4 or 5 episodes lived to my expectations, but as the story unfolded, The Flash became a very attractive show In the chapters in which he discovers or solves something important, you even end up with your jaw on the floor and your heart beating as fast as the flash  Yes, I have to admit that some lines are really cheesy and it sometimes lacks of logic (I mean, he can dodge a bullet and disarm groups of criminals, but he can't do the same to Captain Frost and his sidekick?), but you end up enjoying it  (Yes, I also hate Iris West, the character who only complains and makes every problem bigger)I also hated the end of season 1 where (SPOILER ALERT) he finally gets the chance to save his mother and he ends up backing out just because the flash from the future kind of made a sign for him to stop  I mean, we heard you crying every episode because you wanted to save your mother and in the end when you have the chance you just couldn't do it? And it doesn't end there, because thanks to that, he creates doors for meta-humans of other worlds to happily enter to kill him  (That sounds a lot like something Iris  The Problem Maker  West would do) But hey, he needed new problems for season 2 ;) I'm in the first episodes of season 2 and my best advice for you would be to have an open mind and accept the show's flaws so you can enjoy it and don't judge it for the first episodes (I know they're not really enjoyable)  Also some of us who used to love The Flash of the comics end up thanking for some villains and details we used to love from his story  ",8,-0.2,7.8,"Positive"

Who is feeding the meta-human prisoners and where do they shower? Why can Barry run faster than a bullet but not a flagpole being swung at him? There is obviously no one at the writers' table who is an actual scientist  It is apparent by the plethora of scientific errors  (500 proof alcohol?  Knots per mile? ) The dialogue is really, really bad  For example,  Barry  Run   The chemistry between characters is forced  Plots are the same each week, save for a different villain And consistency is a problem  Only when a punch line is needed do Barry's sneakers flame up after running or (to get her to take off her shirt) Felicity's blouse catch on fire All in all, I am really amazed by how bad the writing on this show is and yet how highly regarded it seems to be on IMDb  To say The Flash is written more poorly than The Dukes of Hazzard or Love Boat would be an understatement  ",3,-0.1,2.9,"Negative"

"The Flash","2015-12-11"," Hearing of this new series, I was very interested to see the portrayal the iconic Marvel character of The Flash with modern graphics and storytelling, but mostly I was hoping that the acting/writing/directing would be better than the previous attempted series from the early 90's  While the graphics and technical details of this new Flash series are fair, the script seems sub-standard compared to the other Marvel series (such as Agents of Shield)  Consequently, in addition to the rather young main cast, the acting tends to be off-timed, unnatural, and somewhat insincere  In time, with improved writing and a more believable acting direction, these things can improve  However, at least for the moment, it's honestly a rather cumbersome start that makes the experience feel more pubescent than its worth  ",6,0.6,6.6,"Positive"

Barry knew what he looked like, couldn't he at least identify him at the Police Department when he was right in front of him?!?!?!?!

"The Flash","2015-12-04"," I just finished watching episode twenty-three of season one, and I can say with full certainty that I absolutely hate this series, and have made a resolve never to watch another single episode EVER again  I've been burned so many times its unreal  At the end of every episode I feel dazed and emotionless due to the stupidity and utter lack of thought which has gone into this series  Each episode, instead of getting better and more interesting, only amounts to more disappointment, anger, and despair  In this post I hope to share with you several reasons why  For another take a look at the utter dryness of the characters in general, as well as a lack of personality of others  Many of the characters started out has hot-heads but then slowly degraded into talkative, moronic, frivolous patsy's  Take Iris for example, she's as stupid as she is self conceited, stubborn and selfish, but notice that over the course of the first season she did anything but improve, and towards the end seeing her stupid smiley face almost made me want to barf, even now it makes me shudder  And I'm thinking the whole time,  Barry actually likes this person? And then supposedly marries her in the future? Just how stupid do you have to BE to LIKE someone that stupid, dumb, and frivolous??  And NO, race has nothing to do with it, it could easily have been a blonde Caucasian and I would hate her all the same  Take Katelyn for another, she started out as a 'take no crap get it done hot head' tech-no chick, and then over the course of several episodes degraded into someone A-L-M-O-S-T as stupid as Iris  Other characters personalities stayed relatively static(sorta like Barry with his whiny, wimpy, cry baby personality), but only because their characters were so dry and inflexible to begin with  For another take note of the redundancy, predictability, and overall rapidity of each and every episode, as well as how not super the main protagonist Barry really is  Each episode starts out about the same: opens up to Barry running, saying something stupid, then ends up at star labs  We then later see an evil meta-human rob a bank or something, while tons of security guards never think to draw their weapons or shoot(because the last thing we'd want to do is KILL the bad guys, they need love too)  We then see Barry rushing to the seen of the crime  Usually he's too late but when he isn't we are forced to sit through an average of two minutes while we wait for him to stop getting beat up, and the bad guy to make his escape  The bad guy gets away while Barry and his tech-no buddies mope at star labs  Throughout all the episodes we are forced to sit through what seems like hours of the love triangle, divided between Barry, Iris, and that blonde haired police officer(who was so dumb that I really can't remember his name at the moment), as Iris' love goes back in fourth between the two, never once actually considering to make her decision and make a commitment to either man  After some more stupid stuff Barry catches back up with the evil meta human and gets beat up again, usually worse than the first time  He is then picked up unconscious later and brought back to star labs where they mope some more  After some more stupid stuff Barry catches back up to the villain and gets beat up, again, but some other person saves him and takes out the bad guy  Afterwards instead of putting a bullet into the villain's head, they lock him up into a containment cell that has no other apparent function as part of the particle accelerator, but serves as a convenience to the screen writers so they can spend more time on figuring out how to screw as many people as possible for the next episode  I could go on and on and on about this, but it serves to show my frustration about how unpleasant each episode is to watch, and how the Flash is so wimpy and useless as an actual superhero that he may as well not have his powers at all  Another thing to consider about this series is all the plot holes  Now even the best books/movies will have at least a small one here or there, but the huge, gaping, plot holes which are littered throughout season one of The Flash are there because of the poor screen writing and story  Take for example when that one meta human steals Barrys speed powers  They eventually take him back to star labs and  jump start  his powers and bring them back by electrocuting him  However, note also that Professor Wells' also lost his original speed powers fifteen years prior, so all that time he never thought of trying that method to get his time travel speed powers back, and when he had seen how it worked on Barry he never tried it on himself? Just one of thousands of plot holes that are strewn throughout the series, and there are far too many to go over them all I'd mention more but I'm running out of time  It is enough to say that I hate this series on many different levels  I went into this series excited to have what I thought from the trailers must be a high quality special effects superhero TV show, but I left feeling stripped of my dignity, stripped of my trust in humanity in general, and indescribably frustrated I wasted so much time  The last episode of the series ended with a cliff hanger that I do not intend to follow into season 2, and if possible I will never again watch a DC comics TV show  ",1,-1.2,1,"Negative"

It's funny, dramatic, interesting, suspenseful and has a certain dynamic between its characters that most shows lack  The characters have depth, they have their own unique personalities and problems, and they all have great chemistry  They also feel like real people, not dark and brooding like batman, not millionaires, but real people who feel, who cry, who laugh and smile  It's hard not to like the actors in this show  Even the villain (spoiler)wells, is like part of the family, you know he's evil, you want to hate him, but you can't! He's just too great of an actor, too amazing of a character to hate despite everything and that's something hard to come by in a TV show  It really makes you want even more of the show just for the dynamic of Barry and Dr  Wells  (End spoiler) Then we have Barry himself, he's not your average hero, he's young, he's plucky and smart, and even though he has been through great tragedy with his mother's murderer, he doesn't let that keep him back, he tries to fix what was done on that night yes, but he also knows somethings can't change and he has to keep moving forward and helping others  Cisco is my personal favourite, funny, nerdy, adorable, and yet so interesting story wise especially with what's been happening to him at the end of season 1 and start of season 2  Let's not forget the actual visual effects of this show! They're breathtaking and even better than some movies  Wide camera shops really give it a unique view when we see the flash and all the powers of the meta humans are in full glorious spectacle without being too over the top  I can never wait for the next episode of this show to premiere, and while the 2 season premieres I must admit were slightly lack-luster, there was that one or 2 mysterious scenes in the both of them that made me have to see what would happen next, then it just kept getting better and better that I couldn't even keep up with the awesomeness! To sum it up, Flash is life! :) ",10,0.6,10,"Positive"
"The Flash","2015-11-08"," I absolutely hate how the show is making Jay Garrick out to be timid and scared  This is the Golden Age Flash, he deserves some respect  I have not read any spoilers so I don't know the future direction of the show, but give him back his powers  Any fan of The Justice Society should be upset at the writers for what they are doing to the original Flash  He is a hero on his world but lost his courage on this one? He is older and wiser then Barry and the writers should be showcasing that  Also, this show and The Arrow are becoming laughable  Every recurring character has powers or wears a mask  There isn't any secret identities (I know in the comics, Oliver does go public, albeit later in his career)  The monologue at the beginning of each show is not needed and somewhat funny  I am happy to finally have my comic book favourites on the big and small screen  If done right it can be great  ",7,0.2,7.2,"Positive"
"The Flash","2015-11-03"," Not one for these live action uncanonical series, since they dramatically de- power superheroes to ridiculous points  Never realised that it would do so as much as it did but well, that's the way it is I never could anticipate how cringy the whole affair would be though  For example, a recent episode showed a very hoary scene of the Flash helplessly struggling to break free from King Shark's claw; the very one that Superboy one-shotted in canon  Despite the Flash having light speed reflexes and speed, the gap of time between him turning around to a not-so quickly moving arm and being caught was apparently not enough for dodging  And they can happily disregard the fact that the Flash can become intangible It's moments like those that really make me want to screw up my face, because it's where bad acting fuses with directly contradicting events  Much lower power, much higher senselessness  But I'll give it a couple of points for some pretty SFX  ",2,-0.1,1.9,"Negative"
"The Flash","2015-10-29"," (SORRY FOR MAKING THIS LONG) So for the record, I have no particular bias for the Flash character when I started this show  I've never read any of the comics, but I have seen a few episodes of the Justice League Animated series, but I never really saw anything that made me particularly attached  So I was surprised when I started this show!!The show, for the most part, is actually pretty entertaining  It's first few episodes start out kinda rough  Dialogue is cheesy, some of the special effects could be amazing here but garbage there  So I'm going to go in depth with the pros and address people's complaints of the show Pros: The show, for the most part, like I said before is rather entertaining  It provides it steady amounts of twist and turns  The actors' performances were solid and they all had relatively well chemistry with each other, making scenes funny when they needed to be, or sad, serious, or strong, they managed to portray it  The special effects were really good for a television show, (even though the first 5 or 6 episodes the special effects look pretty sketchy, like how close ups of the flash running in slow-motion make him look fake and rubbery, like running from the wave after dropping of Plastique in the ocean or when he did his first Supersonic Punch on Gurder ) the music was good, and the season long plot was good to follow  Whats bothering me the most right now is how dense people are, and how they find practically stupid things to complain about  Like  OH MY GOD THIS SHOW IS NOT A GOOD REPRESENTATION OF THE CHARACTER, HIS HAIR IN THE COMICS IS BLONDE, NOT BROWN, SCREW THIS SHOW!!  Please just get your butthurt self out of here  A character is not defined by his hair color  Another issue people seem to complain about is the flash is too young, being 26 years old, while in the comics he doesn't become the Flash until he's in his 30s  Well they explain this in the plot of why they made him younger  *SPOILERS* In the plot, the Barry Allen we know in the comics is currently in the future  In a fight between the Flash and the Reverse-Flash, they travel back in time to the night that Barry Allen's mom Nora was murdered  The Flash fails in saving his mother, instead saving his younger self  After the Reverse-Flash kills Nora and tries to return to the future, he realizes that his Speed is gone  Reverse-Flash (Eobard Thawn) realizes the only way to get back is to create the Flash  In the Reverse-Flash's timeline of the future, the Particle Accelerator that gave the Flash his powers is said by Thawne to be created in 2020  But Thawne kills the original creator of the Accelerator and builds it himself in the year 2014 so that he can make the Flash sooner  WHICH MAKES THE FLASH'S AGE MAKE SENSE  In the original timeline he did become the flash at the age of 32, but in the timeline that this story takes place in, he's 26, so thats out the window Other complaints people have is that the plots are boring, writing is dumb and the writers assume they're morons  Guys   this is a superhero show aimed at both kids and adults based on a comic book, what would you expect? There is no way you're going to get the next Batman Begins (which isn't meant for kids) or a Oscar for best Drama  It's just a show thats meant to have fun and not be taken seriously  It's definitely the best superhero show on the air right now  The arrow is the 2nd best, still entertaining, but not as fun as the flash Anyways, this show is still a massively fun ride! The writers know exactly who the character is, and they don't care what other people think, they're having massive fun with the character and doing it to the best they can  This is a great show and I would definitely recommend it  ",9,0.1,9.1,"Positive"

"The Flash","2015-10-18"," I was a big fan of this show the first time around  I was already something of a comic fan, and this series was a great translation of the material into a series  The Flash was a great-looking show, and the actors played their parts flawlessly  John Wesley Shipp, who played the Flash, has that Bruce Campbell-like ability to portray a likable, average guy, who just happens to get super powers  His sidekick, the lovely Amanda Pays (formerly of Max Headroom) was a good, but underused, addition to the show The special effects were surprisingly good for a TV show, although I do seem to remember some wince-inducing moments, like one villain whose costume included - unless my memory is really messing with me, which has been known to happen - a Nintendo Power Glove On the subject of villains, they were usually done well  I highly recommend the episodes starring Mark Hamill as the Trickster  Fans of the animated Batman series will notice an early version of Hamill's Joker persona here, which is interesting since the Flash comics' Trickster character was basically a rehash of Batman's Joker in the first place All in all, this show really didn't deserve to get canned after one season  Given another season, it could have grown into something classic  Luckily, videos of this seem fairly easy to come by, so it's still possible to check out this underrated footnote in the history of superhero television  ",10,0.8,10,"Positive"

Everyone here is complaining about the acting or the script but that isn't really true to my opinion  Spoilers: A few points did bother me and that is that Caithlin talks a bit too much about Ronnie in the episodes before the found out Ronnie was alive  I mean, has she been talking about him that much for the past 9 months? An other thing is that Iris kind of complains to much and it becomes kind of whining about every bad thing  I mean in the episode Flash vs Arrow, she immediately doesn't trust The Flash anymore although he explained everything to her  I hope they give her more of an add to the show now that she knows Barry is the flash  And I think they should have let the viewers know that Dr  Wells is the reverse flash just a little bit later  But those are just a few points that don't really matter that much  I love the plots and I really have fallen in love with some characters  Cisko!

"The Flash","2015-09-17"," The tl;dr for those who don't want to read: A disappointing show that insults the viewer with idiotic writing to force the plot forward  Hardcore die-hard fans of The Flash will like this, but everyone else will find this to be an exercise in frustration SPOILERS ahead  You've been warned Okay, so I'm not the biggest DC fan  I grew up reading some Batman and maybe some Superman, but my base of knowledge is in fact more Marvel oriented than DC  That said, I do like The Flash and find him and most of the other superheroes that can access the Speed Force to be some of the most interesting characters in comics This show does a pretty decent job of capturing how powerful The Flash can be  When he goes fast, he really goes fast  The thing is though, he's fast  Which means he should be able to solve a lot of problems very easily  But because the writers want to create a sense of tension and have him come up against obstacles he can't just bulldoze through, he doesn't use his powers in those ways  He gets into fights he should be able to easily win, but because he stops and stands there doing nothing for several minutes he gets hit many times  And then he goes fast and ends the fight in an instant  It's ridiculous The character relations are also very poorly executed  There are so many instances of characters happening to be in the right place at the right time to hear the right thing in order to push the plot forward  It's just such lazy writing I have to wonder how much the writers even respect what they're writing  I would expect better writing from amateur level writers since they would at least be learning what sort of novice mistakes not to make  There are so many instances of a character dramatically entering the room after overhearing something that I have to wonder whether I'm watching one of those cheesy soap operas rather than something that takes itself more seriously And then there's Iris  I'm not going to talk about how they changed her race, likely only for the sake of including an African American on their show (token racial diversity character)  But even if she had been casted with an actor that was actually true to the source material, there's still no saving her from the atrocity that her character is  She's such a wishy washy character that can't decide what she wants to do that she's pretty much an insult to the  strong female character  that she's supposed to be  And then there's the scenes where she's angry at her boyfriend for keeping secrets from her  Her boyfriend that is a detective and may be legally bound to keep secrets  Her boyfriend that is in fact keeping a secret that if he reveals may put many people in grave danger  And we have Iris getting angry at her boyfriend for keeping secrets because she doesn't think people in a relationship are allowed to keep secrets  Right  Wow  Such horrid writing  Her character is completely ruined by it  It's obvious this happened to push the plot forward, but it could have been done so much better that all I can feel is disappointment I mean, not everything is bad with this show  There is a lot of fanservice, hinting at many DC heroes and villains that any devoted fan will be delighted to see  The spin the television show has on many of these characters is interesting, and it's definitely cool to see The Flash go up against mainstays of his rogues gallery like Captain Freeze  And there are some scenes and ideas that show a glint of the potential the show has  The thing is though, it's just so marred by the horrible writing that it's only being held aloft by the history and fanbase behind The Flash And at least it's staying mostly true to the comics, unlike Arrow that is really more Batman in disguise, or Gotham that essentially had nothing to do with the comics  It's always nice to see a show that actually respects its source material instead of writing something else entirely while only taking advantage of the characters for name recognition So points for that, I guess It's just such a disappointment for a show like this with so much potential to become so bad due to inept writers  I don't know whether they're being held back by studio meddling, as much of what comes out of CW tends to be somewhat teenage trashy  Or perhaps they think they're writing for children because they think only children like comics and thus they can get away with this sort of rubbish  I don't know  It's just very clear that the writing that's being churned out is very subpar and is a disgrace to the franchise  ",2,0.2,2.2,"Negative"

"The Flash","2015-08-17"," A lot of people who rated the show poorly have credited thay too the writing and campy story plot of the first 5 epidodes, and I must say I agree The first episodes of the flash are slow (pun intended) but the overall season and makes up for the slow start and will make you wish the second season would be here in a flash   Why its so good   1  Character development, while most hero shows fail to develop the side characters this show makes you care for every role then uses thst throughout the season 2  Acting , through the first couple epidodes the acting is laughable, but either when they knew they where getting picked up or when they became comfortable with one another they stepped up on their scting chops   3 The villain , there is only one true villain, the metahumans are training tools don't pay attention to them, the main villain is complex he makes you hate him snd feel for him, he is the ultimate villain while somehow garnering sympathy, you will be pleasantly surprised 4  The relationships    some will make you happy some will make sad , some will be as big as a tidal wave and some will disappear don't be surprised if you are rooting for relationships to fail, don't be surprised if you cry    5  Speed kills    not pg people die, thats always good for superhero movies  ",9,-0.2,8.8,"Positive"

"The Flash","2015-07-17"," First thing I wish to say is that yes I am a comic nerd  But that has nothing to do with whether or not this show was good or not  When i first saw episode 1 i was not overly keen on it  However every episode just seemed to get better and better each time ! What kept this show on air in my opinion was that it was not like Arrow where it had hardly any comedy and just full on action, The Flash was funny every episode and while Barry was not running around fighting crime, he was doing every day things we can all relate to  It has mystery and every episode ( spoiler alert) it has its viewers wanting more clues behind the mystery of Doctor Wells If you want a super hero show I recommend this  And if that was not convincing enough listen to this  When the world around me seemed dull and dark and everything started getting depressing, the only thing that kept the happiness in my heart and the light in my eyes was The Flash  Its full of emotion, twists and comedy  Its like Seinfeld cross Arrow  It simply is not only the best super hero show, but it is the best TV show on air!If you need a show to keep you wanting more, full of action, comedy, love and mystery look no further!!

"The Flash","2015-07-11","  The show is very childish  If it is only for kids than I guess I can praise the show  One thing irritated me throughout the show that the hero runs extremely fast and shows of his speed skills in many unnecessary ways  But when he is fighting against the villain he waits right in front of the villain to say the dialog and get his ass kicked  Flash saves people from burning building and flying car but can not take the villain to somewhere else through speed or cant even take the gun from his hand instead he waits to dodge the bullet  What type of absurd is that? Another thing I saw that there were some college kids as the most skillful researchers  No seriousness in acting only focus is on glamor  Crime happening and the flash group can see everything from their lab  The whole concept is lame than animation its just baseless  I will just say plain up that I'm only reposting this other guys review  All I will add is that he was right on target about what he said  Everything ",2,-0.2,1.8,"Negative"

"The Flash","2015-06-09"," I wasn't a real fan of these live action superhero TV shows  It's like they can't quite capture the soul of the people or the powers  So it ends up kind of boring almost like Smallville, more of a soap opera, than a superhero epic  When I first watched this on the CW I was skeptical but then saw that one of my favorite comic writers, Geoff Johns, helped make it  So I started to take it serious I watched it and it showed the soul of the people AND the powers  Also that it takes the comic mythos to the show as well  The guy playing the Flash does a good job both as Barry Allen and the Flash  What some people also don't know about the villains of the Flash  It's that they're pretty human, almost as human as anyone on the hero's side  They just do a life of crime because that's all they know sometimes  Also the people that do Reverse Flash, Captain Cold, Heatwave, Pied Piper, and maybe even the rest of the Rouge's Gallery might be as good as the comics  I also won't tell who the Reverse Flash is because it'll spoil the surprise to it all  Anyway this is pretty good and not too serious and dark as Arrow is considered to be  ",9,0.3,9.3,"Positive"
"The Flash","2015-06-09"," This series owes a lot to the 1990 series  The Flash , which in many ways was better  Perhaps, the series acknowledges this by casting the actor from the 1990 series as Barry's father, a nice touch For a TV series, the special effects are well done, though on rare occasions they are somewhat lame As for the writing, the story throws in some surprises and keeps you guessing Now, for the characters, Tom Cavanagh as Wells/Thawne has his character down pat  I have met people like that, people who make a deliberate attempt to appear as a good person yet are wolves in sheep's clothing  Also, Carlos Valdes is really good as Cisco, so good that one cannot picture anyone else in the part  In addition, Grant Gustin makes a likable hero Concerning Gustin's character, the writers have made Barry Allen too naive  Really, he was surprised when a crook did not keep his promise! He should be smarter  After all, Barry is 26 years old and works for the police  One would think that he would have learned something about the world with that background Then, the writers had Barry do something that was really irritating in the season one finale  After spending the entire season being obsessed with clearing his father and freeing him from prison and being traumatized by his mother's death, when given the chance to change all that, he does nothing!! When Wells asks why and states that Allen could have everything he wants, Barry replies he already had everything  That just demolishes what a good portion of season one spent building Then, there is Iris  As a previous reviewer stated, the I want to know everything attitude can make her obnoxious  Also, I think it was a mistake having her discover that Barry is the Flash  Some good subplots could have been worked into later stories Finally, Caitlin is likable and seems a better fit for Barry, the same could be said for Iris and Ronny Once again, regarding the season one finale, the writers set up the second season for some intriguing possibilities  With Thawne wiped out of existence by Eddy: Will Barry's mother be alive and his father free? Will the real Harrison Wells be around? Will Barry get his powers in another way? To sum it up,  The Flash  is a good series and worth watching, but it does need tweaking UPDATE:Season two is on a par with the first  Though, one good change is that they softened the character of Iris Cavanaugh continues to give a good performance, making a good distinction between the evil Wells and the one from Earth II I still think that the writers need to wise up the Barry Allen character  Also, they need to follow more of a logical pattern  For instance, The Flash is fast, but on encountering a villain, he does not react fast when she unleashes a sonic blast  In other words, make The Flash more competent Finally, they should have Barry and Caitlin get together  It's just more of a fit and could make for some interesting stories SECOND UPDATE:This series showed promise in season one, but has deteriorated with each successive season As I said before, the writers need to wise up Barry Allen  I don't expect a superhero to be perfect, but he should at least have a level of competence  For instance, the Flash encounters a super villain; he knows the villain's powers, yet he just stands there and lets the super villain attack him  What happened to the Flash's super reflexes?Now, the current season has had too much emphasis on the relationship between Barry and Iris to the point that the series has become maudlin  It even led to the silly musical episode -- totally ridiculous Also, enough of the speedsters! There's the Flash, Kid Flash, Girl Flash, Reverse Flash, Zoom, and now Savatar  The series only needs one speedster, the Flash And, can't the writers be more creative when it comes to villains? Must they resort to speedsters?As may be guessed, because of the above, I am lowering my rating to five stars  ",5,0.8,5.8,"Negative"
"The Flash","2015-06-07"," I must start out by saying I am giving this show an '8' for sheer fact of the potential headaches  I won't say how, but if you know the 'Flash' in DC-lore, you know time-travel plays a key component in his mytho's, which the show shares  That being said, the time- travel creates several instances on the show which elevates it to another level  Why? It keeps momentum  Flash has a rocky storyline, somewhat, in terms of momentum, but it's episodes are hit-or-miss in some ways  While I found them enjoyable, people may see that some episodes don't step it up from the previous, but none fall short of the previous ones fallout, and keeps expectations going forward That being said    the time travel introduces paradox's late in the story  I won't spoil anything, but it does get hairy  That said   As a Flash fan, I will say, this show surpasses Arrow, but only because the creative team seemed to be aware of what they did wrong with Arrow, and capitalize on that  It's got it's flaws, but if you're a fan of anything super-hero related, this show delivers  That being said, as a DC-lore fan for the Flash in particular, don't hold it to the same stone  Several things are changed, somewhat for the better, but keeps the same in some regards I can't really sum up this show in a regards to the 'word limit' I am limited by for this review  If you like the DC-lore or just super- hero shows in general, I'd recommend the first few episodes  Patchy at first, so the first episode MAY deter people since it's obvious they were experimenting with elements, I wouldn't recommend getting an opinion until maybe five or six episodes in  Season is 23 episodes thus far, so you won't be wasting more than a few hours  This show is far from perfect, but it manages to attain a level of stability that Arrow garnered after it's first season's 'mid-season' break  It's a nice contrast to Arrow's nature, and compliments it well to show how Barry and Oliver differ as heroes/vigilantes in their own regard, while still doing what they feel is 'justice' oriented  Fan or not of Arrow, I'd say this show at least deserves a viewing, properly  If you can't get into it, fine, but ignoring the potential of the show is honestly a mistake  ",8,0,8,"Positive"

"The Flash","2015-06-02"," Leery of the promos for this series THE FLASH (2014), based on the popular DC comic-book character, I went into this series knowing very little  After Season 1, I now know there are several versions of the Flash: Jay Garrick, Wally West, Bart Allen, and the one this show is based on   BARRY ALLEN, that the show's intro reminds us of each week!Barry Allen is played by Grant Gustin, who I must say is superb in this role! He imbibes Barry with an energy and humor that is very refreshing and makes you root for his character  Not the typical brooding, somber, super-serious hero, Barry is a breath of fresh air  Gustin has proved to the perfect choice for Barry Thankfully, Gustin is not alone in the well-cast department  He gets tremendous support  In the Pilot, we are introduced to the rest of the the Flash cast  At the start of the show, Barry, a 25-year old forensics scientist for the Central City Police Department, has been struck by lightning at his lab at the police station  The accident was in caused by an explosion at the premier scientific facility in the city, StarLabs  Flashfoward 9 months and Barry awakens from his coma in StarLabs, where we are introduced to what would become Team Flash  Team Flash consists of Dr  Caitlin Snow (played with class, humor, and effervescence by Danielle Panabaker), a medical doctor and geneticist who had been working at Star Labs for years, Cisco Ramon (played with nonstop hilarity by scene-stealer Carlos Valdez), a brilliant IT and bioengineering expert, and last but not least Dr  Harrison Wells (brilliantly played by Tom Cavanagh in a complex, enthralling performance deserved of an Emmy nomination)  Wells' is a pioneering scientist who created the PA with help from a host of the most brilliant scientific minds, including Caitlin, Cisco, Caitlin's fiancé Ronnie Raymond (Robbie Amell in a solid recurring role), a structural engineer, and a host of other scientists, some of whom died in the explosion, including Ronnie, while others abandoned Star Labs after bad press left the facility a shell of it former self  Wells, Caitlin, and Cisco are all that remain of the lab and had worked for 9 months to keep it going while Barry was in his coma  Barry and the StarLabs crew get off to a rocky start as Barry doesn't fancy himself hero material, but his new powers provide for fascinating new research opportunities for the team  In my favorite scene of the Pilot episode, in a remote location, the scientists study Barry's powers on a test run  It was this scene that established the team chemistry between Barry and the others: Barry and Cisco's mutual nerdy behavior, Barry and Wells' mentor-student relationship, and finally Barry and Caitlin  Caitlin, initially standoffish due to the loss of Ronnie, begins to come out of her shell due to Barry's friendship and positive influence  Not just professional, Barry forms strong personal bonds with the scientists over the course of the season In Barry's personal life, at the age of 11, Barry's mother was murdered by a strange entity and his father unjustly convicted  So Barry was raised by Police Detective Joe West (superbly played by veteran actor Jesse L  Martin, from  Law and Order  fame) from the age of 11 onwards  During this time, Barry formed a lasting friendship with Joe's daughter Iris West (strongly played by the stunning Candace Patton) and eventually fell in love with her during their college years  Iris is working at Jitters, a Starbucks-type establishment, while working on her dissertation in journalism  Another key member of the equation is Detective Eddie Thawne (well played by Rick Cosnett, in a very genuine, likable performance), who is both Joe's partner and Iris' boyfriend  The situation is complicated as Barry is secretly in love with Iris, which Joe knows, Eddie senses, and Iris is oblivious to  Makes for interesting drama!During the course of Season 1, The Flash battles  Meta-Humans , a variety of people, mostly criminals, who were also affected by the PA explosion which gave them powers different from Barry's  So the team must use it's Star Labs resources to guide Barry in his fight against these powered beings  Another major plot point of Season 1 is Barry working towards proving the impossible happened the night of his mother's murder, especially since the impossible gave him his powers A huge draw of this series is the emphasis on humor, which underlies many scenes  But also the show pulls off the emotional, dramatic scenes exceptionally well as we really feel for these characters  Many shows nowadays have a generic, interchangeable quality about them where you really don't care about the characters or what happens to them  Interestingly, for a lighthearted, comic-book show, the Flash has a lot of heart and depth  In addition to the strong cast, 'The Flash' boasts some of the best special effects in modern TV shows  The Flash effects are cool and we get a taste of them in a significant portion of every episode There are of course a few negatives  The Barry pining for Iris reeks of Clana on 'Smallville' and that's not a good thing  I've already seen enough of the angsty hero on that show, which I don't believe is nearly as well-written than this one, and survived so many seasons mostly on it being about 'Superman' and really no other major comic book series on at the time  Also, many of the meta-human characters are one-dimensional villains so far  But there is definitely room for improvement as Caitlin and Cisco's characters are destined to have powers and so that can create a lot of drama and tension between them and Barry/Flash, as they are currently the best of friends Season 1 overall is a success and pulled no punches  Already a hit out of the gate, I foresee 'The Flash' going for several seasons!

(season finale) (spoiler) when Barry runs to stop the black hole from sucking the entire world into it! The animations, the story line, the way the entire season gets summed up, This episode was worth it! Hence writing this review I do agree that the series has a lot of sci fi in it which people might find difficult to comprehend, but hey, we all loved the avengers didn't we? and the whole point of it being a Science Fiction story is so that it can be out of this world and break the laws of physics  ",9,-0.7,8.3,"Positive"
"The Flash","2015-05-28"," So The Flash is a spin-off from Arrow and is about this guy Barry Allen who can run fast and with the help of some scientist friends becomes the superhero the Flash! I really enjoyed when he first showed up in Arrow season 2 and again I enjoyed watching him here Grant Gustin does a great job in his role, his performance was very entertaining during all the comedic, emotional and action scenes; a really good casting choice  Talking of cast, another great role is Tom Cavanagh as Harrison Wells, he was a such an interesting character to watch, I really did love all of his scenes  My favourite character was Cisco though, probably because I related most to him being a geek and I laughed at all his movie references  Joe West was also enjoyable to watch, he was basically the common sense of the show, he gave great advice, he reacted to things the same way any normal person would, he just seemed like a great father-figure and our eyes into this world Plot-wise it was mostly your freak-of-the-week deal where they dealt with a new meta-human every week but I enjoyed it anyway, it worked for this kind of premise and allowed the series to show off Barry's various abilities  The overall arc was really engaging too and came to an epic, emotional, and downright entertaining conclusion; one of the best finale's I've seen in a long time The special-effects weren't too bad either, you had the odd obvious CGI moment but for the most part, the Flash's running effect, the meta-human's abilities and the final scenes of last episode all looked great The Flash really is a fun science-fiction drama; it goes to show that you don't have to make all your heroes depressingly dark and edgy, it can be fun and colourful without crossing over into cheesy (although The Flash did not outrun some cheesy lines)  ",9,1.2,10,"Positive"
"The Flash","2015-05-28"," Before the show aired I was really excited and keen  However, after watching the entire season I couldn't help but be left a fair bit disappointed  Don't get me wrong there are things about the show I like its just that there was a lot of stuff I hated  For starters I hated the inconsistency of the Flash's powers  In an early episode he can move at speed A  Then in a later episode when he's supposed to be faster he moves slower then speed A  Another ting that really really ticked me of was in the first episode he says he got his name from Oiver Queen  Then they leave it and let Iris come up with the Flash  Speaking of Iris I hated how she found out about his secret  I feel like that electric zap was in there for the sole purpose of her discovering his secret  Seriously, it's never brought up anywhere else and what are the chances that it never will  There are some good episodes, some of which I really enjoyed  Despite this there are some awful ones as well  The first 8 all real like clichés to me  There's one where he loses his powers, he fights his old bully, the hero goes bad  They've all been done before and when I thought the show was picking up it went back to silly freak of the week episodes  Another thing that really annoyed me was the constant death of characters  It really annoyed me when they would create these interesting characters only to have them killed in that episode or the next  I know it didn't happen with all of them but for the most part it did  Moving on to the positives  A major positive for me was the casting  I thought every actor was a good selection and played there part excellently  I loved the Easter eggs  Farris Aircrafts, Jay Garicks hat and that glimpse of the flash museum just to name a few  A third positive was the Reverse Flash  Personally I loved the story of the Reverse Flash, it was handled very well and was super cool  Those short clips at the end of the episode were another plus especially when they teased the truth about Doctor Wells  Another thing the Flash did really well was Eddie  At first I thought he was just gonna be a big tough douche just in the show to be with Iris so Barry couldn't  However as the show progressed I found myself liking him more and more  In the end he was one of my favorite characters from season 1  In Summary, there was plenty of stuff liked about the Flash  It's just that the stuff I didn't like far outweighed the stuff I liked and left me severely disappointed  ",6,0.6,6.6,"Positive"
"The Flash","2015-05-27"," I was a bit worried when I saw the trailers for the Flash  I knew I was going to watch it, because I'm a fan of all things superhero, but out of all the superheroes, Flash interests me the least  He's a superhero who can run away from things  And I watched the pilot episode and it just seemed to be slightly generic  Here's love interest, here's the boyfriend so love interest is harder to get, here's the mentor, here's the father figure and here's the comic relief duo  But it started building on that, adding more depth to these characters (Except for one who I'll get to later) making us care for them and want them to survive, so each time a character gets injured, we feel it with them  I've heard lots of people going  There's no danger to Flash as he's not going to die because he's the title character  but that's not what's important  What's important is who he can save  And this makes it abundantly clear  Of course there are a few bad things to itIris  She is the love interest and it can't be more boring  She makes everything about her, even if it doesn't involve her  The world will be getting destroyed and she'll be moaning that Eddie isn't telling her police secrets  If you're going out with a police officer you should know that you're not going to get told everything because it puts you in danger! Eddie also comes across as slightly boring sometimes and I think they could have developed him a bit more  There's a subplot in the back end of the season involving him, Iris and Joe and it basically shows he has no backbone  Which could have been developed slightly with him standing up for himself, but it leads nowhereIn the end, The Flash is a great TV show and a amazing superhero show  If you haven't seen it, I advise you do although some parts may be difficult to get if you don't watch Arrow  I'm giving it 8/10 ",8,0.1,8.1,"Positive"
"The Flash","2015-05-27"," First episode when I watch this TV series, the plot and story quite interesting Barry Allen Job as Forensik Scientist make this movie like CSI or something like that  And when Barry got accident with Particle Acceleration it's seems like another my favorite super hero Spider Man, ordinary people with super power  At episode from 2 up to 15 story feels flat without seasoning plot that is difficult to guess  Like another Super hero they chasing some bad guys and win the battle  When Reverse Flash shows up this TV series more interesting  Have some plot ends with the question of what happens next episodes  And the stories be better and better  and we as spectator have a question what this story will be end, who is Dr  Wells actually  How Barry defeat Reverse Flash ?  I hove next episodes have more dramas and more surprises plot  The less very interesting from this serial story is romance between Barry Allen and Iris west, except at season 1 episode 15  OK just it my opinions about this TV series for superhero fans  ",9,1,10,"Positive"
"The Flash","2015-05-26"," The show is very childish  If it is only for kids than I guess I can praise the show  One thing irritated me throughout the show that the hero runs extremely fast and shows of his speed skills in many unnecessary ways  But when he is fighting against the villain he waits right in front of the villain to say the dialog and get his ass kicked  Flash saves people from burning building and flying car but can not take the villain to somewhere else through speed or cant even take the gun from his hand instead he waits to dodge the bullet  What type of absurd is that? Another thing I saw that there were some college kids as the most skillful researchers  No seriousness in acting only focus is on glamor  Crime happening and the flash group can see everything from their lab  The whole concept is lame than animation its just baseless  ",4,-0.3,3.7,"Negative"
"The Flash","2015-05-26"," The Flash is one of the best super hero TV series nowadays, surely the early episodes were a bit disappointing due to the use of in almost every episode  The monster of the week   But as the show progressed and when the main villain was presented, it only got better  One aspect that makes it more interesting is the shared universe with other super heroes TV shows, creating such enormous possibilities The light tone of the TV series and funny moments contribute enough for The Flash differentiate from other series that have a darker tone  In us develop a kind of sympathy with the characters, as the synergy and the connection grows between the characters along the episodes  In the end, The Flash shows how to make a TV series, despite being extensive, with a good story, with a good cast and in which you feel pleasure to watch it  ",9,0.5,9.5,"Positive"

"The Flash","2015-05-22"," Had the misfortune of sitting through the first episode of 'Flash'  I had moderate expectations going into this on the basis of its IMDb rating  However, it turned out to be your average clichéd, bore-fest  You have your typical teen drama, pathetic acting, and a boring main character  Avoid this if you value your time  It is beyond me how anyone could gain enjoyment form this crap  It has potential to be a great show for kids and childish, naive adults  Anyone over 18 who thinks this show is anything near 8/10, has either never seen a television show or movie in their entire life or has an abnormally underdeveloped brain  (stupid)  ",1,-0.4,1,"Negative"
"The Flash","2015-05-20"," Zesty may be a word you would usually associate with food  Something with a lot of flavour and maybe a little spice  Well for me that definition really fits The Flash  There's a hell of a lot to like here  This series has real pace, it frenetic, just like its hero  There are moments of introspection but this sits alongside round after round of really well crafted action scenes which are kept interesting by an abundance of genuinely novel plot twists and turns  Combine this with some really decent acting and a dash of spice in the form of a love triangle and some pretty out there villains and you have a real winner in this series  Eight out of ten from me  ",8,0.6,8.6,"Positive"
"The Flash","2015-05-20"," i think that the flash was awful  i know many people would disagree with me but this is just my opinion  The pace of the story line is just way too slow  The plot is weak and the only reason people even watch this show is because they think that the super hero in this show is cool, not because of the plot  The whole show feels way too cliché and not enough originality I definitely would not ever recommend this to anyone unless except for ten year old kids who just care about the superhero that is why i am just gonna give this show a one out of ten  I would give it even less stars but it doesn't let me  In conclusion i think that watching this show was a complete waste of my time but if you want a cool superhero show with great plot this is not it  ",1,-0.4,1,"Negative"
"The Flash","2015-05-19"," I saw the first episode of The Flash on the recommendation of my cousin He said that this one is best TV series out there As he make me see the first episode I was left amazed I already Saw TV series like Arrow,Gotham Vampire diaries and many more but this one really impressed me I just wanted to see the whole season As the season progressed its story became even more interesting The cross over of Arrow and Flash was always the best Episode 8 features Arrow with some nice twists Episode 22 and 23 still being the best Acting was best from everyone especially Grant Gustin playing Barry Allen or the Flash His charm makes the show even more lovely Overall the show is my favourite of all time and it has a lot to offer Really see one episode and you will not be disappointed  ",10,1.2,10,"Positive"
"The Flash","2015-05-18"," I watch a lot of TV series and this is the best so far especially if you watch it at the same time as arrow  They've made each episode exciting and relevant to the main story line and they've opened it up for a number of different characters to come in and also intertwine with other series like arrow  The only thing that I could complain about is that there isn't a correct order to watch the arrow/flash in  I wish they would have cast Grant as the Flash in the upcoming Justice League film and I think that it was a massive mistake not to  Also I hope it works well with the upcoming Legends of Tomorrow TV series because I think that there's huge potential for these 3 shows to work together!

"The Flash","2015-04-18"," This is the first time I felt the need of leaving a review in 4-5 years since I'm using IMDb  I can say, as a DC fan that this TV-series gets more and more disappointing  The actors are without a doubt the worst choice the casting director could have made  (I mean seriously, JD's brother as the main villain? )   Also, the every episode is very poorly written, it's like they don't even try  Just put some clichés there and some really bad puns ( In the last episode, The Flash fights with a girl who uses bees or robotic bees to attack him and she felts the need of using puns like  get out or I'll BUZZ myself in  and after one minute uses the phrase   Do you know what it's like to be stung by someone? I will sting you now   Not sure why DC or WB allows this to happen  Marvel just released Daredevil, a character with far less potential than The Flash and for a superhero series, it is brilliant compared to this  ",2,-0.3,1.7,"Negative"

The flash was one of the few shows where i get to see some amazing and cool application of science  Starting from the particle accelerator to everything that sisco makes  They are not actually unrealistic  We never know in future those stuffs may actually happen  No, I am not talking about the meta-humans  I am talking about the cool scientific stuffs Watching the show the young generation will get inspired about science  The work of Programming, Mechanical engineering and the cool scientific machines are really cool Not only about science but the storyline, the suspense, the twists and turns which is shown in every episodes is simply awesome  ",8,0.1,8.1,"Positive"

They should warn to watch -18 people  How is that, the guy was in coma for 9 months, but he is shaved and has makeup already!!!Even the face of actors is unrealistic  If this was a movie, i might be watched it  It is very disappointing  While superhero movies usually are unrealistic, but they always try to make you believe what they are saying  The flash, starts by every things that are not believable even in a dream  I hope, we will see much better works in the years ahead  ",1,-0.6,1,"Negative"

The uber story arc has been mostly predictable for me, knowing the characters/universe well, but it still has little surprises  The actor playing Harrison Wells is delightful, as is the Joe West portrayal  Love love love the way the super- villains are being rolled out -- it's like 1 part Smallville (event responsible for creating the monsters of the week aka super-villains), 1 part Mutant-X (thinktank HQ for the good guys seeking out their own), and 1 part something new and unique It's a bit campy, but not as bad as many hero shows  The characters are of good character, even the bad guys  And I can't wait to see more  Full of win!

"The Flash","2015-03-25"," Well i usually review a show after the 1st or the 2nd episode but for a show as big as this one and for the huge commercializing and publicity it got before even it premieres i had to wait ;) So i'm reviewing this after 15 episodes now and things are unexpectedly going well ,, like really well The show plot moved amazingly from just a guy who's foolishly dealing with his new power to a guy dealing with others have somehow similar ones,, personal problems ,, comedy bits and thrilling drama  The storyline is just moving towards unpredictable characters in the show ,so some people you want expect they're bad will appear to be really bad   , the plot is still tight ,well written so far, i didn't really see any noticeable mistakes or questionable scenes ,, because  as many shows have in their first 10-15 episodes  every scene most be strong and well prepared, shot and edited months ago   The Cast were just okay at first but when you engage with them so much in the scenes you'll see they're doing a great job   They also bring to the show a lot of people we've seen on TV before like the  Scofield brothers  from Prison Break and  Stephen Jameson  from The Tomorrow People :)The only episode (and that's maybe only me ) which i thought was a bit off , is the one when they brought The Arrow ,, i mean it went somehow cheesy but they recovered quickly till the best episode so far and the one made me write this review,, episode 15     just WOW   So overall the show started just fair then turned to maybe one of the best shows not only on CW but on TV this year ;)Well for that it is indeed recommend   ",8,0.1,8.1,"Positive"

I don't really think that a pre-made show needs this many breaks  Since they already have all of the episodes acted out and ready to run on TV they shouldn't need breaks  It really pisses me off because it is really unprofessional  Shows like Gotham and Breaking Bad never did stuff like this  That is the only reason why I can't make up my mind as to whether or not I should keep watching the show  I would recommend to not watch it until the whole season is over that way you don't have to worry about all of these stupid pathetic breaks  ",5,-0.1,4.9,"Negative"

So i decided to join in on it since he has a really big TV, anything on a really big TV has to be good  Unfortunately nobody has a big enough TV to make this show good At first I was laughing but to my alarm the show nor my friend was laughing with me  This is when I realized my friend might have autism or some other developmental problems  The character interaction is awkward and the acting is hilarious  Some of the scenes like when the flash pushes someone out of the way at the speed of sound apparently they land on the floor as if they had simply fallen over, and I guess running into someone at just under 800 mph is okay  I was explained that the flashes power somehow merges onto other people when he carries them   fair enough Just as most TV shows the guys look about 30 but also like they are 16 year olds and homosexual  The voices like the arrow who looks like he wasn't given to many doses of estrogen but unfortunately his voice does, at least under his batman mysterious voice from which I had many chuckles  The only saving grace was the girls are pretty hot, they don't fit the costume department, nor did they have any lines that wasn't causing me to hold in a laugh as to not annoy my friend  I couldn't actually finish watching with him bc I had an important errand to run called not watching TV that makes me worry for humanity when I see it's voted so grandly I think the show would be better if they just pulled random cards out of a hat that people wrote their lunch orders on and the show was based on the flash delivering said lunches except the flash would be played by a midget with a beard and when he stops his beard grew like 20 inches and people where like wtf there is beard in my lunch!

So i decided to join in on it since he has a really big TV, anything on a really big TV has to be good  Unfortunately nobody has a big enough TV to make this show good At first I was laughing but to my alarm the show nor my friend was laughing with me  This is when I realized my friend might have autism or some other developmental problems  The character interaction is awkward and the acting is hilarious  Some of the scenes like when the flash pushes someone out of the way at the speed of sound apparently they land on the floor as if they had simply fallen over, and I guess running into someone at just under 800 mph is okay  I was explained that the flashes power somehow merges onto other people when he carries them   fair enough Just as most TV shows the guys look about 30 but also like they are 16 year olds and homosexual  The voices like the arrow who looks like he wasn't given to many doses of estrogen but unfortunately his voice does, at least under his batman mysterious voice from which I had many chuckles  The only saving grace was the girls are pretty hot, they don't fit the costume department, nor did they have any lines that wasn't causing me to hold in a laugh as to not annoy my friend  I couldn't actually finish watching with him bc I had an important errand to run called not watching TV that makes me worry for humanity when I see it's voted so grandly I think the show would be better if they just pulled random cards out of a hat that people wrote their lunch orders on and the show was based on the flash delivering said lunches except the flash would be played by a midget with a beard and when he stops his beard grew like 20 inches and people where like wtf there is beard in my lunch!

"The Flash","2015-02-10"," My 12 year old son and me watched the first part of this series tonight on cable  Normally I am not a fan of this genre but every minute was a pleasure to discover  This was amazing with a good introduction in to the story  It is the same formula as in the Batman movies  Not too complicate and easy to follow  And it worked here too as many reviews on this site confirm  There are lots of plots and twists and I was never bored  There is a good mix of suspense and research material about his power mysteries from Flash  The director did a solid job and even if some scenes could have been stolen from other marvel comics  Anyway, I had an entertaining time and I am already curious to see part two next week when Flash comes back again on TV  Even my son gives a flash rating of 10/10  ",10,0.5,10,"Positive"
"The Flash","2015-02-04"," The spoilers here are very minor and will not affect your experience if 
 you're the average person  Still, better safe than sorry 
 
 WRITING (Conflicts, character actions, and dialogue)
 
 The writing in this show is less than impressive  There is no such 
 thing as subtlety and half the dialogue is them throwing in the word 
  fast  for the hell of it  At one point, a character says to some 
 random thug  Freeze! Now, get on the ground or do you wanna find out 
 the hard way that you're not faster than a bullet?  I'm actually quite 
 certain that the line verbatim is worse than that 
 
 A lot of plot points make no sense, and this is a huge problem with The 
 Flash in general  The Flash is so fast that few conflicts are actually 
 conflicts for The Flash, but rather than being creative and trying to 
 think up interesting conflicts, they make the characters mentally 
 incompetent to the point that The Flash, who can dodge a bullet, cannot 
 dodge a punch  This actually becomes the main plot point of an entire 
 episode  His inability to dodge attacks at normal speed makes no sense 
 
 Also, he has a tendency to block bullets that he doesn't even know are 
 there  In one episode, he reaches behind him and pinches a random spot 
 behind his neck and there just happens to be a bullet there for him to 
 block! What an ESSENTIALLY IMPOSSIBLE COINCIDENCE! That is the laziest 
 writing ever   We need our character to get shot at without getting 
 shot  Let's just have him randomly reach back for some reason, I'm sure 
 we'll figure it out in post  
 
 There's an episode where he has to catch three motorcyclists  So, he 
 runs to each of them, takes them to a police station and handcuffs them 
 to a pole like he always does 
 
 I'm just kidding, he creates roadblocks where he thinks they'll go so 
 that he can make all the motorcyclists go towards each other, and then 
 they won't know how to move past each other, so they'll stop and the 
 police can get them, at which point there will be an utterance of 
  Checkmate   That last bit is also not a joke  That happened  This is 
 actually something that a producer and a team of writers looked over 
 and said  Nothing wrong here  Onwards to production! 
 
 Also, this is My Little Pony with adults watching (so, just My Little 
 Pony   with Rainbow Dash as the main character, I suppose)  They like 
 to have Aesops to each episode, and they're very basic moral lessons, 
 or even broken ones, and then they'll do what's essentially a Dear 
 Celestia inner monologue at the end of each episode   Today, I 
 learned     Really? There's no subtlety in the character development at 
 all  At certain points, I swear the characters literally look at the 
 camera and go  I've really changed today  I used to think A and now I 
 think B  
 
 Here's a bit of dialogue meant to be badass 
 
 (Right before Barry's about to leave )  Barry   (Barry stops to see why 
 his peer decided to stop him during this urgent mission )  Yes?   Run  
 
 CONSISTENCY
 
 There is no consistency with Barry's powers  The effects of running 
 really fast (friction, air compression, etc ) turn on and off randomly  
 At one point, a woman's shirt burns off despite that making no sense 
 whatsoever, presumably because one of the writers thought that the 
 actress was hot and knew he had the power to get her to reveal a little 
 more 
 
 As I mentioned before, he just decides not to dodge punches  Or grab 
 people's weapons to disarm them  He also runs slow enough for The Arrow 
 to see him and aim at him when he's fast enough to see bullets  Bullets 
 are so fast that 500 feet away, all you can do is blink before the 
 bullet reaches you  Otherwise, you're completely still  Everything 
 should be frozen for Barry, but he runs at the speed of a falcon from 
 time to time 
 
 TECHNICALITIES
 
 Bullets and guns  Don't expect them to make sense  Physics  Chemistry  
 Science in general  Tensile strength being a huge factor when hitting 
 someone? Hearing a sonic boom from something that hasn't gotten to you 
 yet? A gun that creates the heat of the Big Bang? A needle the heat of 
 the Sun would kill everyone in at least a one thousand mile radius  A 
 warehouse the heat of all the energy in the universe (which, you might 
 notice, doesn't make sense) would evaporate all matter in the entire 
 solar system  But no worries here, just some second degree burns (these 
 were normal humans that got second degree burns, not The Flash, so no 
 superpowers to withstand the energy of the entire universe there)  500 
 proof alcohol? Iron oxide being uncommon?
 
 Turn your brain off or get a hemorrhage  It's nice to see The Flash 
 moving about with live actors (though poor actors), but that's it  
 That's the only pro  That's all this show gets  ",2,-0.4,1.6,"Negative"

"The Flash","2014-11-30"," THIS SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SPIN-OFF! This is an evolution of superheroes, in the television show industry  'Arrow' was created because WB/DC needed a product, similar to the chemistry of Batman and what better character than Oliver Queen/Green Arrow  I mean billionaire playboy becomes vigilante? Come on, in comparison Green Arrow is a lot like Batman, it's uncanny  Let alone the fact, that Oliver Queen and Bruce Wayne share a few similarities in their characters  As for 'Arrow' the show, it has the same dark, realistic feel that The Dark Knight trilogy had, (and the same can be said for Man of Steel)  And I love that WB/DC are going this way about it  The show has proved it's worth for being an epic adventure for Oliver Queen and an awesome introduction to the character, as well as a kick ass TV show on it's own Though in comparison between the Flash and the Green Arrow, the Flash is a much more involved and important character than the latter, in respect to the entirety of the DC universe  By this I mean, everything in some way is connected to The Flash e g   The Flashpoint  story arc for instance  He has more power in his tiny red gloves, than some people give him credit for  I mean, some fans of the comic books, might even say that the Flash is more important than Superman or Batman, (even though the majority of the mainstream public, look up to these defining superheroes more)  I mean the Flash brought back comic books, at a time when they were deemed inappropriate for children! I am of course, referring to the beginning of the Silver Age of comic books, which began with 'The Flash'  He was the little guy, in the midst of all these other famous superheroes like Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Captain America and The Human Torch  Yet 'The Flash' was the underdog, that inspired and defined superhero comic books and their franchises to this date Which leads me to this TV show   When I first saw Grant Gustin on 'Arrow', my initial thoughts weren't exactly promising toward his acting or charisma, let alone the fact that they hired a fairly unknown actor for such a big role  But how wrong I was, he's good at playing the little guy because that's what he is and that is who Barry Allen is  He's the little guy, who inspires everybody around him and it's only now that I can see the potential that the show, Grant Gustin and this incarnation of Barry holds  For every obstacle that this Barry Allen faces and overcomes, it deems himself even more worthy to becoming the definitive live action version of 'The Flash'  I mean in episode 6,  The Flash is Born  that punch was the first time that I realised and saw that this version of Flash could very well be 'The Flash'  It looked like he was nearly flying, like the very first superhero that is 'Superman'  Grant Gustin has really grown me, I just love watching him now  He's just so lovable as his character and as an actor  So cool    So, so COOL!I want this show to do so well, that WB will consider these versions of the Flash and Green Arrow to being included in the upcoming Justice League films  I mean jeez    I'm actually enjoying 'Arrow' and 'The Flash' more than 'Man of Steel'  That being said, I can't wait for 'Dawn of Justice', Ben Affleck as Batman is going to be so cool!! This opinion and want for them to include Stephen Amell and Grant Gustin in the Justice League film, stems from the reality that it's easier to create a universe in a TV show  I mean, by the time 'Dawn of Justice' comes out, Zack Snyder will only have 5 hours at best, to have shown his universe  In comparison to this, Arrow will have finished it's 4th season and The Flash will have had two seasons  By my calculations, that means that the TV show's universe will have had a total of 92 hours worth of stories and character development with a much broader universe to enjoy For me, this Flash is 'The Flash'  ",10,1.1,10,"Positive"

"The Flash","2014-10-26"," I really wanted to like this latest attempt to portray DC Comics'  The Flash  character on the small screen  I grew up in the early 70's reading all the Barry Allen character's comics and he was my favourite of all the super heroes going around at the time  I also enjoy the show's progenitor  Arrow , itself based on another DC character, but like with the Oliver Queen character, the story here is changed to suit the demands of today's American TV audience To be honest though, there never was much depth in the original comics anyway, Barry Allen was a blond, crew-cut 9-5, police scientist regular guy with a reporter girl friend (later his wife) Iris West, who fought a Rogues Gallery of costumed villains with his super-speed and super-vibratory powers  Here Iris West is changed into a young black girl and her absent-minded professor father in the comics to a right-on detective colleague of young Barry's who's got his back  Shades of Oliver Queen's troubled love-life from  Arrow  and of course there are parental issues too with the imprisonment of Barry's father for killing his mother likely to be the  Fugitive -type running plot throughout the series  There's also a back-up team to assist our hero, again just like in  Arrow   To be fair I've only seen the first episode but I think I know what I'm in for, namely, flashy (no pun intended), special effects and shallow characterisation  The young actor playing Barry Allen seems too callow for the part  The SFX are mixed, the blurring as Flash whizzes around town is fine but the close-ups of him on the run make him seem static  I like the costume as it doesn't deviate too much from the original and I liked the discreet nods to the DC universe with references to Grodd the super-ape and Ferris Airlines (Carol Ferris is Green Lantern's girl-friend in the comics), plus of course there's a mutual admiration hook-up with Stephen Amell's Arrow thrown in for good measure My hope would be that they play up the super-villains aspect of the comics as well as developing Flash's powers beyond just running around fast all the time  I don't think I'll get it somehow as our boy gets sucked into a tug-of-war for Iris's affections and a drawn-out plot to free his dad  I'll keep watching though, I owe it to my teenage-self  ",5,0.1,5.1,"Negative"

"The Flash","2014-10-08"," The CW's latest superhero series is THE FLASH, based on the long running DC comic; the character of Barry Allen, a forensic investigator, was given a try out on THE ARROW last season, so fans got a sneak peak and knew what the expect  This was one of the few new shows this season that I was actually looking forward to seeing, and it did deliver on its promise  Unlike GOTHAM, over on FOX, it didn't try to pack too much into the first episode  The thing I liked most about the show was that it had a hero who actually seemed to get a kick out of having super powers and enjoyed thwarting the bad guy  Barry Allen's The Flash is a good contrast to Oliver Queen's the Arrow (who has a nice cameo) who is all grim determination over in Star City  In casting Grant Gustin, they made Barry a lot younger than he was in the comic books, but what did anyone expect from The CW; the mysterious death of his mother and the unjust imprisonment of Barry's father is the Big Dark in this Flash's past, but it does not consume him the way it does for some other super heroes (talking about you Batman) The other good thing about THE FLASH is how the creators are trying to work the larger DC universe into it, with it gallery of Meta Humans and Super Villains  The explosion at STAR Labs, which gave Barry his super speed, has released alien energies into Central City and presumably the wider world, and though the laboratory mishap is an old comic book trope, it still gets the job done when it comes to creating plot possibilities  In the pilot we saw Barry take on The Weather Wizard, and the previews gave us a glimpse of Wentworth Miller's Leonard Snart aka Captain Cold  This season also promises appearances by Heatwave, Firestorm, General Eiling, and a return of THE ARROW'S Clock King, played the superb Robert Knepper There is a good supporting cast headed by Jessie Martin as Detective West, whose daughter Candace Patton is the love interest; true fans will remember John Wesley Shipp, who plays Barry's incarcerated father, as playing The Flash in a short lived 1990 TV show  Tom Kavanagh is Harrison Wells, the head of STAR Labs and Barry's benefactor, but in what has become a cliché for these kind of shows, is revealed in the final scene to be not the man he appears to be (maybe ZOOM, the reverse Flash)  The CGI was pretty good for this kind of show; the fans standards are pretty high these days, especially after seeing Quicksilver in X- MEN:DAYS OF FUTURE PAST I first encountered The Flash long ago in a great cartoon on Saturday morning, and I still think animation is the best way to do super heroes, but this live action Flash is a good effort  And while we're on the subject, will someone please bring back Saturday morning cartoons  ",8,0.8,8.8,"Positive"

"The Flash","2014-10-08"," So finally it's here  After swearing not to follow another CW cheap series after Supernatural ends, which hasn't happened, I found myself catching up with two seasons of Arrow in a matter of days after ignoring it for 2 years, just because a friend told me that Flash is featured in it and there'll be a stand-alone show for him  I had been waiting for something for Flash for years, with its exciting ideas and possibilities, and now, the first episode didn't disappoint The show appears to be following some standard superhero and CW routines, which is frustrating and annoying sometimes, but also can be done well  It's at its worst when it gets into relationships and characters we couldn't care less, and at its best when   you guessed it, when it strikes you with the actions  Some over-familiar elements have to be addressed here  Anyone who has seen one episode of Smallville can tell the unmistakable similarity between their pilots, namely the big idea that create our one-episode super-powered freaks  Only what used to be a Kryptonite meteor-storm becomes an unknown energy breakout in the city  Then there's the  my dream girl's dad is a cop and he wants his daughter out of it so I'm filled with guilt  formula that has been used just way too many times in recent years  From the Amazing Spider-Man series to Flash's sister show, Arrow  Seriously CW? You guys really that short on scripts?Speaking of Arrow, Oliver's guest appearance is most welcome here, even though he didn't really do anything  It gave me some expectations in his coming 3rd season  But to be honest, I usually have to fast- forward some Arrow sequences that involve his girlfriend Laurel or his sister  Green Arrow is a very limited hero, so a large part of the show has to be focused on relationships and character development, which usually in CW shows range from mediocre to downright unwatchable  The Flash, on the other hand, although share some of those problems, does promise a kick-ass action that wakes me up instantly  It's not of movie standards of course, but it's satisfactory enough it made me say  so that's where my Supernatural budget went  So where does it stand among the many superhero-themed shows today?

"The Flash","2014-10-07"," As a big fan of super hero movies and television, I was very much looking forward to the first episode of the Flash  Particularly given Arrow is one of my favourite shows, and this new version is a spin off, or at least heavily connected to that series As with Arrow, many of the elements and characteristics of the original comic book hero have been kept, although many are also adapted or even ignored to appeal to a more modern and mainstream audience As with the original comic book character Barry Allen (Grant Gustin), is a police scientist, or CSI investigator in this case, who is still a highly moral individual despite his history and profession  This was an important aspect of the character that had to be kept as it was central to who he was  In Justice #8 (2006), Batman says,  Barry is the kind of man that I would've hoped to become if my parents hadn't been murdered   Like the original character Allen is also always late, however unlike the original Barry Allen this version is much younger, and is not married  He does however still reside in Central City Of course viewers of Arrow will already be somewhat familiar with this version of Barry Allen, as he was introduced to audiences in the second half of season two of that show  This was a good move by the producers, as it creates an existing connection between the character and the audience before the new show actually airs The series starts with a flashback from Allen's past when his mother was apparently killed by some strange (electrical?) phenomenon  His father was jailed for the murder and remains in prison, although Barry believes him to be innocent and has been investigating the death on his own for many years  No doubt, this investigation will be a continuing theme throughout the series, or at least the early seasons The circumstances that transform Barry Allen into the Flash are again similar to the original comic book in that he is struck by lightning and doused by a mixture of chemicals  Although in this version a particle accelerator built by Star Labs triggered the storm when it blew up after being turned on for the first time  I suspect this too will play a major part further down the track Particularly given Allen awakes from a nine month coma in Star Labs (or at least what was left of it after the explosion), and that is where he discovers his new powers, and also how to use and control them  Star Labs and its owner Harrison Wells (Tom Cavanagh), also supply Allen with his suit  But is Wells helping Allen for purely altruistic reasons, or has he another agenda that will reveal itself it coming episodes? Jesse L  Martin (Law and Order), plays Detective Joe West who helped raise Barry after his father was sent to prison and works alongside him  His daughter Iris West (Candice Patton), who of course was Allen's wife in the comic book, is more like a sister in this series, although Allen wishes for more While it had its faults I really enjoyed the first episode of the Flash, and look forward to seeing the direction the show will take  The production values were high, which is to be expected as DC and Warner Bros  are behind the series, so the special effects were also of high quality  The acting was solid, and the script while not providing anything really new, did allow for some intriguing possibilities in the future If you're a fan of super hero shows, and in particular Arrow, I highly recommend giving this series a go  While at this early stage I would not wish to compare the two, one thing that is obvious is the Flash will not be as dark as Arrow  Whether that's a good thing or not, is entirely up to you  7/10 ",7,0.7,7.7,"Positive"
"The Flash","2014-10-07"," Yes, I know, the fanboys are not going to be happy with this review because most of them live in an alternate universe where ANY comic (graphic novel) that makes it to TV is automatically an object of worship about which nothing unkind can be said But the pilot, the  origins  if you prefer, was way below what it should be Here is the thing  I grew up with the DC world, in real time (the 60s), I have seen every theatrical release of a comic hero ever done, and on this database I am (egad) a  top reviewer   So said, and acknowledging the decades-old battle between DC and Marvel for comic supremacy, I was happily surprised when DC endowed Arrow with rich quirky characterizations and great dialog, elevating it to fair competition for AGENTS OF SHIELD  (The latter has the Whedon brothers behind it, the real  superheroes  of TV writing) I had high expectations for FLASH and not one was met  When I see that tiny grimace on the face of Grant Gustin, I do not see a superhero trying to adjust to his powers, I see an actor trying to adjust to his character  Big difference The supporting roles in the pilot seem weakly drawn, and the pep talk from Stephen Amell should have come with a warning for diabetics Sure, this series will find its sealegs over time and the fanboys will forgive almost everything, but the fact remains, a weak start  ",6,0.3,6.3,"Positive"
"The Flash","2014-10-07"," I absolutely loved this pilot!! As a comic book fan myself I don't mind the few changes as it makes it more modern It always is going to seem cheesy because it is a comic book show  You cant have everything perfect  Also I love how they added some of theistic from the Toby Maguire Spider-Man as well nice touch! So looking forward to more of this show  I also enjoyed the costume change as well  That definitely needed an upgrade  I also really appreciated the meeting between Flash and Arrow  Otherwise it wouldn't have made sense as they do live in the same universe  I would go on but all I can say is the show has potential to be one of the best TV shows running right now!!

"The Flash","2014-10-07"," This show had an amazing pilot that never made me tire of action or story  The story is fairly done and though DC is taking its movies down a grittier line, we still have Arrow (our Emerald Crusader/Dark Knight) and we have Flash (our Crimson Speedster/Man of Steel), however Barry isn't invincible, and this show brings out the truth of becoming a superhero with powers  Flash shows us the hopeful side of DC as well as bringing that hope into the every week's heart of fans  Side Note: In light of the huge rave Batman V  Superman is getting, we get to enjoy (Flash and Arrow episode 8) CW's Batman V Superman before Warner Bro's Batman V  Superman XD  This show shows extremely high potential and is living up to the expectations set up by its great liner-backs (Arrow, Man of Steel, The Dark Knight Trilogy, etc  ) 10/10 ",10,0.5,10,"Positive"
"The Flash","2014-10-07"," I finally have found a show to replace Smallville  It has the right amount of action with good actors and solid story lines  Love the heroes and villains  I love that they added Tom Caughlin to the cast  Not sure how I like the leading lady but the girl who plays Caitlin is a sure thing  I loved her in Sky High  A must add to your Tuesday night lineup I was disappointed with Arrow  I was hoping they would have brought in the actor from Smallville and I hate the leading women in the show  She can NOT act  At least the characters are likable and believable  The young kid who Plays Barry/Flash is perfect like Tom Welling as Clark/Superman  I also am happy that they explained a lot in the first episode  ",9,0.9,9.9,"Positive"
