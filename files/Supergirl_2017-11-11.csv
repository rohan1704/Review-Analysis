"Supergirl",2017-11-10," I'm a little surprised this show does not have a higher rating. I've been watching this show before it moved to the cw and our family tries to never miss it. Although this season they changed time slots and that's NOT working for me. Anyway, Melissa Benoit is adorable as her dorky alter ego and kick ass in her hero form.I wish Callista Flockhart would have stuck around longer but at least we had her for a little while. The actress who plays Lena Luthor is great!!! I also like supergirls sister Alex who works for the government and is initially her only confidante.I'm glad the cw has added this show to its lineup, its a much better fit. I love the crossover shows with the Flash which are great fun and will hopefully continue. If you are on the fence, take the leap and watch! Great superhero fun! ","8"
"Supergirl",2017-11-07," I am done with the show #Supergirl. We are now at the beginning of the third season and Supergirl has taken the Road of  Bones , after the 5th season, getting more and more stupid with each episode. I am fed up with the SJW crap, all the feminist bullshit for millennials and other propaganda they keep shoving up the viewer's throat. Relationships are USELESS, badly written, with no impact on the characters just to please some social / minority agenda (Mon-El is antipathic, Maggie serves no purpose, but for a LGBTXYZ quota on the show). Dialogues are badly written, nearly all males depicted act as if they are castrated. Just because the audience also includes kids, does not mean that actors should talk like retarded teletubbies, just look at Joss Whedon's Buffy and Angel. Supergirl seems to think that people keep attacking her because of her lady parts. Superpowers are rarely / badly used (WTF!): Supergirl getting her butt kicked by humans with some gadget<U+0085> where is the superspeed, where are the superreflexes? Writers do not seem to have read any Superhero comics, and do not understand their appeal. Every time Clark Kent / Superman is mentioned, he is put into a bad light (?!!) However, if you forget the subtext that  Women are better than men , then they won't forget reminding you at every turn. Actors are good, completely out of sync with the real comics, writers suck as Black Holes suck matter. I was already watching the last 10 or so episodes with the mouse more pressed on fast forward than on play. Everything mentioned here is the tip of the iceberg, I won't even talk about the rest. Mellissa Benoist being really cute is not enough a reason to keep watching the show. Were there good episodes? There were some really GREAT ones, especially the crossovers with Flash and the Arrowverse, and these are the only ones I will keep watching.Could they get any worse? When a Villain shouts  SUPERGIRL! , Supergirl could ask  DID YOU JUST ASSUME MY GENDER?  ","1"
"Supergirl",2017-11-05," I really like this show and believe that it has great potential to go the distance at least to 10 seasons; However, the current story-line for the past two seasons has been to promote LGBT awareness and acceptance to create a genre that bridges all generations on the subject matter. The problem here is that it's being dished out in spades without the consideration of balance and at times taking away focus from the actual story-line of Supergirl. Imagine if every show of Supergirl included a priest citing passages from the Bible and building a story-line that suggests you should go to church every Sunday! Would you accept that has okay and normal? So yes being Gay is your right so is going to church on Sunday, therefore, Please! Could the producers and writers find a balance that exercises a story-line that doesn't seem dogmatic or overbearing also at the cost of ratings, but rather one that sticks to the excitement we all experienced from season one that of Supergirl!!

"Supergirl",2017-11-04," *** This review may contain minor spoilers ***Hey there, I usually don't write reviews but for this show I just had to do it.Now that being said lets get right into it...First off...the show just looks cheap and that is not due to some low budget issues, no it is due to the poor script acting and the awkward changes to some of the key characters from the comics...now the positive thing is that they kept the names right, but that is about it. From there it is just getting from bad to worse like the very distinctive Feminist propaganda and agenda, the racist move to replace the appearance of a fan's beloved teen geeky character like J.Olsen with an old black man... Just awful...not to mention all the explicit gayness side of the show. Not that I really care much if someone decides to go against the nature and unlike any other representative of the roughly ~8.7 Million species that are out there that happens to fancy an individual of the same sex as his own, but I'd rather avoid seeing it on TV...and even if this is 21st century 2017 I still can't understand how people could say that being gay is normal...it is more acceptable and not so shocking as it was in the past but it most certainly is not normal. I can't sit in front of the TV with my little daughter and let her watch that trash, as I would definitely am going to be asked questions that I am not really sure how to answer...It is getting out of control with these gay relationships invading my favorite TV shows...and before you say  Oh, look another homophobic guy ...no that is not what I mean...do what you like and with whoever you like, but something that is not natural should not be tolerated in the sense that if it exists it is normal and must be displayed like that...also before you use words like discrimination... well I don't find it discriminating if you don't like to accept a gay relationship or call it normal simply because it isn't it is against the nature thus unnatural...it would be discrimination if I say  I don't want to see people with different skin color than white in films  because that is something natural and normal...So that is it to summarize the show: It is about a girl, you will not forget that; women are as strong as men, if not stronger; lets give this show a modern look change beloved comic characters' personality, appearance, skin color; lets throw some heavy gay drama aspect as wellIt is really hard to enjoy the show so you would be definitely better off and find something else that is worth watching!

"Supergirl",2017-11-02," It was an okay TV show, but season 3 is such vile ideological, brainless propaganda it deserves to be canceled yesterday.I love superheroes and it saddens me that Supergirl is hijacked by the leftist ideologues. Kids need someone to look up to teach them good values and proper behavior like courage, truth and selflessness. They don't need to brainwashed into group think and identity politics, scared to even question that and think that silencing anyone they disagree with for whatever reason is acceptable in a democracy.I wish producers and writers publicly apologize. Fat chance of that happening, but you can not watch the show. Which is what I'd recommend and what I'm doing. Vote with your wallet and your attention. You do have a voice and a choice. ","5"
"Supergirl",2017-11-02," Disregard the hateful sexist racist homophobic republican reviews !! It seems these blowhards are just blowing hot air because of their hate and intolerance. This is the greatest show ever !! Great writing and characterizations !! The show perfectly balances action humor romance and pathos. ","10"
"Supergirl",2017-10-31," The writing for this show just continues to go downhill into Season 3. It's like the writers don't even know what they've written already. For example having Maggie's father commenting about how they want to build a wall. Just stop with the constant Donald Trump jabs already. I'm as liberal and progressive as they come, but even I find the constant political garbs off putting and unnecessary. It's sort of like in the debacle that was Season 2 where they had Kara tell Mon El that maybe being Supergirl and being with him was enough when in Season 1 she told J'Onn that being Kara Danvers and having her job at CatCo was just as important to her as her Supergirl duties when he offered her to work full time at the DEO. Do these writers have existing story line amnesia or something?What I'm really irritated with is the show's handling of Sanvers. These writers and show runners knew from the start how invested the LGBTQ community would get in Sanvers, especially after giving Alex such an honest coming out story. But unfortunately, they completely botched Sanvers with a rushed, barely fleshed out story line with minimal screen time...then gave them an unrealistic engagement at the end of Season 2. Now in Season 3 we have to believe that they are going to break up over Alex suddenly deciding becoming a mother is more important that being with Maggie? Really? It's OOC writing and and insult to the healthy LGBTQ relationship they were trying to portray to us. Look, I understand the show shouldn't be relationship drama heavy, and I agree. But these writers are the ones who keep insisting it be shoved in everywhere...and they can't even write a decent relationship to save their lives!I'm officially ditching Supergirl. I'm not here to watch them tear apart one of the few positive LGBTQ relationships that are out there right now. And I'm definitely not here to watch Kara be all moody after Mon El's exit only to have the childish dude bro return in a few episodes anyway. It's gross. Supergirl is gross...a gross train-wreck. ","1"
"Supergirl",2017-10-30," Ugh...where to begin? I liked Season 1 of Supergirl. Given its cheesy moments at times, Kara was an empowering character as she was coming into her own as a superhero. And Alex..Alex was actually my favorite female character. What was great about Season 1, for me, was that there were so many amazing, strong female characters, which is rare for television these days. Then Season 2 came around. I don't even want to get into how awful that season was with Kara taking a back seat to Mon El's story while having to watch her eventually hook up with him and become a side character in her own show. Plenty of other reviews have voiced their disdain for that disrespectful frat boy better than I ever could. I did love the addition of Lena Luthor and Alex's coming out story line. Fast forward to what we've endured so far in Season 3...Mon El is still somehow mentioned in every episode even though he's gone. Tech genius and all around bad ass Lena Luthor has given up LCorp so she can run CatCo...a company she knows nothing about and let's be honest...is a step down from being a female CEO at a tech company...an industry consisting mostly of men. Maggie is still only  Alex's girlfriend  and now Alex is suddenly obsessed with having children, (And has been grossly OOC this season) which is going to be the demise of Sanvers...one of the few healthy, positive w/w relationships on screen right now. Not to mention the writers can't even remember their own story lines and are making it up as they go along so they can get in as many jabs at Trump as they possibly can. (They're building a wall?) Really, because last time I checked, in the Supergirl world, Trump wasn't president. The only thing worth sticking around for at this point is the Sam/Reign story line. But I don't think it's worth enduring the rest of the dumpster fire writing that is continuing to plague this show. Sorry to say, I'm done with Supergirl. Which is sad, because I love the SG comics. And I was hoping we'd finally get great representation in a female superhero. Well, I was wrong. Guess I'm going to have to look elsewhere. ","1"
"Supergirl",2017-10-30," I think Supergirl needs to change the style up if they want to continue: make Supergirl more of a badass and more confident, and less emphasis on the romance stuff; that is how a superhero should be. Instead of just propagating only feminism content, it should be able to inspire EVERY young person, that they can be super themselves. I won't say much about the lesbian content, but it shouldn't be the main point of the show. I like how Supergirl sometimes partners up with Superman and other superheroes as partners in crime, keep those going. ","5"
"Supergirl",2017-10-30," I started out really liking this show but am really tired of the lesbian love story. I do not want to see it and do not think it is good to be forcing this agenda on children or anyone else for that matter. I will probably quit watching because of this and I'm sad that so many shows are doing this same thing. ","3"
"Supergirl",2017-10-30," I was never impressed by this show from day one. The acting was forced and never seemed to show that anyone was doing anything except acting. The story line was not half bad however and there have been so many new shows over the last several years where the acting was  forced  and improved immensely that I decided to see what happened. Season one was OK. In season two I started to say  Uh oh  and in season three this show has gone full-on politically correct leaning heavily left so that the last episode I watched LITERALLY had a screaming rant about a country that wants to kill immigrants just because they aren't here legally. In that episode alone I was subjected to over half the show being a demonstration on the left's agenda with only part of the show being about superheroes. I'm out. This show has become a progressive medium to push their agenda and it is not even done very well. That's not why I watch TV. ","1"
"Supergirl",2017-10-29," Season 1 was a good start, although it tried a little too hard in some areas (like trying to appeal to teenage/twenty-something girls) - which is not to be confused with the feminist message/theme. But overall the main characters were steady, believable, and the action/plot lines were interesting and fun. Season 2 faltered - a lot. It got way too racy, on both sides of the gender coin; it suffered the charismatic loss of Calista Flockhart and I really wasn't sure it would recover. The plot(s) were less interesting, less adventurous, the inconsistencies and forced points became too numerous or too jarring to ignore or overlook. And watching it with my kids became kind of awkward.But season 3 has been awesome so far. The writing, acting and chemistry of the cast is really coming together, the stories are more interesting, true to character (and life, despite the superhero genre, which is the point). Episode 3 (Far from the Tree) may be the best episode of all 3 seasons, but definitely top 5. Characters that I was really getting annoyed with (for writing reasons, not actor's performances) really come alive (like Maggie - her presence has driven me nuts but she won me over last week!).I hope whatever is going on early this season sustains throughout. This show really can be one of the best on TV when it stops meandering and trying to be too many things at once. ","8"
"Supergirl",2017-10-27," Great premise -   All girls can be Supergirls !  I think the potential to role model here is terrific. But - what god awful plots and execution. Soooooo trite it's hard to believe that this has made it beyond the first season. But - as we are now living in an  alternative  world - all seems possible. Sad. ","1"
"Supergirl",2017-10-27," So I started watching Supergirl with high hopes it would be better than Smallville, and it was a delight, at first. They stayed true to the comic book origin story, they dressed her in a costume that was faithful to the comic books, best of all, she could fly.Then slowly but surely the lefties in Hollywood started their not so subtle propagandizing.First we had the evil Martians, who just happened to be white, embarking on genocide of the green martians (martians of color, hint, hint, wink, wink).Next, we had the Supremacist group that wanted to eradicate all aliens. Interestingly, every single member of that organization just happened to be white.Then, we had the evil government attempting to control the illegal space aliens, but the point was clear, they were alluding to illegal aliens in the US.Finally, we have to have at least one gay or lesbian. It happens to be Alex. The problem is that slowly and surely the program is becoming more and more about Alex and her lesbian love life with at least three or more lesbian scenes or references per episode.The show has become less and less about the exploits of Supergirl and more about left wing propaganda. If you are looking for entertainment, this is no the show for you, it has more left wing propaganda than CNN or MSNBC.I would recommend that young children not be allowed to watch this show. ","1"
"Supergirl",2017-10-24," If you're looking for a lesbian show that has superheroes in it, this show is for you. If you're looking for a superhero show, well then notsamuch.Do yourself a favor and stick with Marvel if you want real superhero shows that don't get TOO political. If you must watch DC, Flash is by far the best if you just want to be entertained.Supergirl - season 1 showed so much potential, but once it moved to the CW, it went straight down the tubes. Too bad too, as Melissa Benoist really is a very likable Supergirl and really plays the role wonderfully. ","1"
"Supergirl",2017-10-24," Supergirl is sort of what The Flash was the first season. Its dumb, have tons of plot holes, supergirls powers changes all the time and some of the characters leave much to be desired. BUT it is also goofy, fun, decently entertaining and superhero-y, and in difference to the horrible Flash TV- show Supergirl stays that way. In other words Supergirl is not very good, but its still watchable and entertaining all the way up to season 3. With that said however the show is also promoting tons of liberal/socialist ideas and doing so too much in your face and even make gay-ness a major plot point for many episodes. That is annoying since it feels pushed in there and exists just for political point of it. I do not mind gay characters, they can be great and show versatility and diversity. Look at Joey in Agents of Shield, they just mention that he is gay in passing and make a couple of impasses about it, but it is never in the center and is never a big deal, that is just who he is, as it should be. In Supergirl being gay is a such a big thing that it overshadows everything else and that destroys the show. Some episodes feel right and I feel like  now , now this show is good. But in the very next episodes it crashes again. As an example of this I can mention episode 5 of the 3rd season, which is a good episode, but all the teen-drama-lesbo-ludicrous crap drops the episode from a solid 8 down to a 3 or 4. I will stop watching this show now, someone let me know when its about supergirl. I give the show a 4, which is much better then Gotham and The Flash ( 1's ) and slightly below Arrow which was great the first two seasons. Supergirl can be really good at times and if they drop that too-much-in-your-face-propaganda and develop the characters a bit further it would be a very good time spent. I can recommend the show, but mostly for young people and for those leaving their brain on standby. DC need to do something though, all of their shows are failing while AoS is the best thing on TV at the moment so I would suggest bringing in new talent and shake things up a bit. Kill of a few characters, mix the earths into one single place and bring in better writers and directors. There are good shows and good premises within the DC TV universe, but its not coming out and sadly it is getting worse... ","4"
"Supergirl",2017-10-23," I started watching this show last year and I found it not catching at all. But this year, after seeing some scenes from the second season, I started re watching it and found it captivating. Yes, the first season is not something special but the second season is completely different. Plus Kara's romance was completely amazing and Mon El is definitely a funny and interesting character of the show.I loved how he is getting used to being a human and their habits. I have completely enjoyed it and I can hardly wait to see season 3. Definitely worth to watch! ","9"
"Supergirl",2017-10-18," I have two issues with Supergirl.1/ Too much self doubt (it's a theme in The Flash and Arrow as well). So glad the characters in Legends are mentally stable. I have enough issues of my own without listening to the characters complain for 42 minutes.2/ Also this year the terrible music at the first and end. I'm finding a lot of shows like that now a days and it's a turn off. ","5"
"Supergirl",2017-10-17," Supergirl is my favorite show so far. I've watched it so many times. I started to watch it sometime in August. Season 3 started off with a good start. There where some sad moments like; in season 2 Kara had to make a difficult decision that caused Mon-El to leave earth. I really did love the crossover episodes. I can't wait until season 3's crossover begins. Maybe session 3 will tell us what happened to Lillian Luthor. Lillian Luthor helped save the world and then she disappeared. I hope Clark Kent will be in season 3. ","10"
"Supergirl",2017-10-17," This will mostly be a condemnation of the writing, but first lets talk about the actors. The actors are doing the best they can with the drivel given them by the writers. Still, the best description for the actors that I could summon if the writing was good, would be  adequate . No Oscar winners here. Now, on to the writing. The show has degenerated into a lesbian soap opera, complete with sexual scenes completely inappropriate for the time slot. On top of that, we are beat over the head with an unending stream of Liberal hogwash, and poorly written Liberal Hogwash at that. Even the show supporters are forced to utter excuses like:  give the show a chance, it'll find it's way . Sadly, the show WON'T find it's way. CBS (and now CW) are determined to shove this Liberal propaganda down our throats and AREN'T going to change it, no matter what. The shows offensiveness is actually BY DESIGN, but created by people completely unable to recognize or acknowledge the mess they've created. If you've seen the  male-lead  superhero shows, you see that their writers build up their characters, both male and female. In Supergirl, only women are built up, men are depicted as evil, lowlife rats. the Supergirl writers only see the show as a place where you have to tear others down (the men) in order to built women up. What sad lives those people must lead (I mean those who live around the writers). ","1"
"Supergirl",2017-10-14," This could have been a great series. ** spoilers **But of course, Hollywood, being run by liberal dupes seeking to brainwash the world into their morality - or rather the lack thereof - and their political agenda of promoting LBGTQ, AGW, NWO, and all the rest of the now ubiquitous tripe being poured into your head by virtually every lamestream media dump out there, just is so freaking obvious it's sickening. The original red-haired, naive and freckle-faced Jimmy Olsen is now an underwear model style black guy with strong self-confidence. Sexism is rampant.Supergirl's human sister is moving towards lesbianism. The glaringly obvious propaganda and brainwashing tactics present are so pathetically obvious that a smart child could see through it. All the mega-corporation heads are women, oh except one guy but then he's a macho, self-centered jerk. The new hyper-feminist trash sexism that's flooding the poor world every day now is present in abundance. This is liberalism propaganda more than simple TV entertainment.The liberal post-humanist agenda is everywhere in this piece of politically correct marketing. Liberalism is a mental illness, but Hollywood producers are apparently too ill to notice how toxic they really are.I gave it a 4/10, for decent FX, some good action, some original story lines that aren't too far from the original comic series and some cool sci-fi technology.But let's face it. When Superman and the rest were invented many decades ago, 99% of the world rejected the LBGT lifestyle as perverse, and of course, they were right. Save yourself and your kids from the indoctrination. Watch something else with normalcy, decent morals and no shoving the twisted liberal mindset in your face - if you can still find any such thing on TV. ","4"
"Supergirl",2017-10-14," Season 1 was quite good and held well to the superhero genre. Season 2 started well but drifted deeply into interpersonal drama. Season 3 started the way season 2 ended, with less emphasis on the superhero and deeply into character emotions/relationships and social issues. These are important discussions, to be sure, but I watch superhero shows to see action and fun, not for deep emotion or for a critical societal exposé.Frankly I don't care who's straight, gay, engaged, in love, depressed, happy or psychotic unless it directly relates to the villain:heroine story line. Supergirl has, seemingly, fallen to influences (pressures?) far from the original comic book universe. It has become a soap opera. ","4"
"Supergirl",2017-10-14," CW has RUINED this show. We loved watching this show in the first season, when Kara was the focal-point and the show was about a delightful every-woman becoming a super hero, and all that entails. You had a strong female role model in Kat Grant, like-able support characters, and a great story-line. Now its a depressing melodrama about relationships and overt political agendas.Come on, can't we have ONE show that a six-year-old girl can watch and enjoy without having someone's agenda shoved in her face? We used to love watching Supergirl with our daughter, but we quit watching in season 2 due to the drastic change in the nature of the show.Don't take it from me, look at what CinemaBlend has to say.  The Season 3 premiere was watched by 1.86 million viewers and scored a disappointing 0.5 rating in the key 18-49 age demographic in Live+Same day calculations, making it the lowest-rated show in its time slot. In fact, the only Monday night show that performed with lower numbers was The CW's new series Valor, which only won a 0.3 rating and 1.21 million viewers. While it was to be expected that CW numbers would be lower than other, larger networks, TV By The Numbers reports that Supergirl tied its series low rating with the 0.5. Season 3 is not off to a great start. ","1"
"Supergirl",2017-10-10," I can't stomach it anymore, I'm done with this crap. All they do is push their Feminist Liberal BS all the damn time. I think the goal of this show is to push the feminist liberal agenda and to manipulate the public with what they call alternative truths aka Lies. Most of my friends and family have stopped watching this crap, even my mom who is a left wing extremist can't even stomach this crap. ","1"
"Supergirl",2017-10-09," Every since Supergirl's sister came out, the show has been nothing short of an ad for LGBTQ. The relationship between Alex Danvers and Maggie Sawyer is nothing short of mawkish. The plot line between the two has nothing to do with any of the stories. It is all,  Are you really gay?   Are you really into me?   Of course, I am. You're my forever love.  OMG! Why don't they just take out a billboard? This is losing me as a viewer. ","5"
"Supergirl",2017-10-09," If you like Political correctness and feminism this show is for you, For me I don't want this crap shoved down my throat, I prefer watching shows that are not so pc and feministic! Whoever made this show definitely did it to please the leftist regressive democrat supporter types but its terrible all around! ","2"
"Supergirl",2017-10-08," I was really surprised by the negative reviews. Don't get me wrong, I'm not saying this is one of the best shows on TV but... it really is fun to watch and a nice break from all the dark and gritty stuff I'm used to. Sometimes a feel good show is just what you need and this fits the bill really well. I'm late on this one and literally binged watched series 1 in 3 days. I'm about to binge watch series 2 and I'm really looking forward to it. Maybe that's what made me enjoy it so much. Watching it without the interruption of ads, having to wait a week for the next episode or dealing with a mid season break means I could really get in to it. I love Melissa Benoist who plays Supergirl. She's adorably dorky as Kara but switches so well in to hero mode as Supergirl. The perfect choice. I also love her sister Alex (Chyler Leigh) I loved her in Greys Anatomy before this. A fantastic actress. She cries so convincingly that I often have to wipe away a tear! My point is - the actors are great and most of the characters are a joy to watch evolve. I was particularly taken back by Calista Flockhart. She's fabulous as Cat Grant. I've probably rambled on too much but I feel like this little gem deserves more credit. If you feel like you need a lift after watching one of the many brilliant but grim shows out there, this is a sweet and gentle diversion. ","7"
"Supergirl",2017-10-04," I am not one to go out of my way to write a bad review; I'd generally prefer not to spend any more time than necessary on a terrible terrible show. For Supergirl I make an exception for two reasons: I am too disappointed not to, and I simply can't help but feel obligated to echo the sentiments of many other disappointed comic book fans. I'll explain...Although I like the actors for Supergirl, Kat, and Winn, I am less than thrilled with pretty much every other. Mechad Brooks is a badass and absolutely cut out for a killer role in a super hero movie but that is exactly why he should not be Jimmy Olsen... Jimmy is a scrawny nerd and that's the way I like him. The rest of the characters just seem too contrived with the exception of a few cameo characters I could love in anything. Yet, admittedly, I'm not convinced that the issues are because of the characters they cast or because of the incompetence of the writers and directing team.My most severe problems with Supergirl are the story lines and scripts. Riddled with political agenda topics, whiny and jealous main characters, and childish fights, the show has left me cringing so bad for three whole seasons that I'm ashamed to admit I've watched as much as I have. The only reason I've made it this far is because of a deep- rooted loyalty to DC and a misguided hope that the writers would figure out what isn't working. I've given up hope. I will not be continuing on past he third season with anything short of replacement of the writing team and/or director. I truly hope that happens... ","1"
"Supergirl",2017-10-02," I was watching this with my wife and trying to get my teenage daughter watching it with us.It started out a little hokey, but that was kind of expected. Kara was always a bit on the naive side starting out, so I expected as much.There were several episodes that actually had me kind of choked up. They were very well done. I really liked watching the character grow and come in to her own.Unfortunately that didn't continue.I didn't mind Cat Grant being a man-hater, it kind of fit her character. Supergirl being neutral kind of fit hers.Having every bad guy become a woman hater and/or racist/homophobic/etc, turning the show into a social justice warrior platform, not cool. In season 1 the episodes usually started with a liberal slant and would show the other side of the argument, which was kind of nice, but I tire of politics in *everything* I watch. It tried to be objective but you could tell the stance of the writers, but they did try. By the end of season 2 I really felt like the show was attacking me and my family's beliefs. When a show pulls current events into the story they should realize that first off most political disagreements are not black and white and secondly it isn't a good idea to vilify half of your audience just to make a statement.The problems aren't simple, the solutions aren't simple, putting them into a superhero show, oversimplifying them and vilifying people that disagree with you isn't cool.I'm going to give season 3 a shot. My wife isn't unless I convince her otherwise. ","3"
"Supergirl",2017-09-24," Detectove Comics was founded in 1934 (right after the Great Depression) Why is this relevant? Because, children, of course! Imagine a time when true justice was a scarcity and there weren't enough resources to go around, (not to mention a whole generation of new parents being forced to make difficult decisions on a daily basis just to get by)...who do you think suffered most of all,,? ( tin hat theories aside) I'd like to believe that superhero comics were created *first and foremost* to fill a social gap by providing the youth with much needed role models, ultimately, restoring innocence, hope, imagination and a sense of right or wrong etc (or a the very least an escape ) during dark times.Fast forward to 83 later, and baby, things have not changed all that much!!! Only this time around we (adolescent-/adults), have selfishly robbed our children of this precious gift, replacing it with disposable characters, media and toys, we have grossly twisted the ~essence~ of comic book superheroes out of context and why they were created in the first place to suit our own insatiable appetites for entertainment, nostalgia and greed.--you don't have to look far into the comments and reviews to see it.Having said that, I LOVE this show for the exact same reasons that people hate it It has kid-friendly dialogue and story lines which are easy to follow, portraying 'realistic' challenges faced by the female protagonist.. packed with a healthy dose of good old- fashioned girl power (feminism?!, my left t*t!) I would have absolutely gobbled this up as a young girl struggling to fit in. Haters need to get over themselves cut the show some slack already and let a 12-year-old girl ( or boy for that matter) be the judge of this one rather than picking apart a beautiful thing!? Don't get me wrong, marvel's Jessica Jones may be bad a** but It is certainly not something I would watch with my daughter, however this one I can!! &Even then, with all the drama and violence and intensity that is already over saturating the fantasy market, it's kinda nice to take a break from the all the doom and gloom by watching something light and refreshing with just enough mystique, action and heart to keep me wanting more. Perhaps not be the best show to marathon, but I'm happy it's a thing. I enjoyed the Supergirl movie as a kid and I feel like the show did a pretty good job of capturing the essence of it. Full of familiar faces and crossovers to boot what more could one ask for? IMHO this series was well thought out and put together in a way that is very family-oriented.. although it's still 'finding its feet' and can be corny at times and I'm totally OK with that <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B8><U+008C> ","8"
"Supergirl",2017-09-10," I tried to give the show a chance when it had it's series premiere in 2015, but it was terrible and so cheesy and cringey that all of the characters I grew to love as a kid growing up got ruin by appearing as different characters on the show.I didn't watch glee while it was on and haven't heard Melissa Benoist sing at all, but she does a terrible job at playing as Supergirl and ruins the image of who Supergirl really is.And the show uses characters who appear as background characters in the comics be main characters on the show that are very boring and seem like very lifeless characters.I love how DC acts like all of their programs,movies, and other DC brands are very dark and gritty and Marvel is dumb,funny, and light, but Supergirl and other shows in the Arrowverse prove to be very silly and light, and the Marvel-Netflix show are what DC thinks their shows are.And it seems like the show is trying to turn Supergirl into Wonder Woman, just like how Arrow is trying to turn Green Arrow into Batman,The Flash into Superman, and the Legends of Tomorrow into the Justice League.After watching episodes from each Arrowverse show (Arrow,The Flash,Supergirl, and Legends of Tomorrow), it seems like The CW does a terrible job with DC superhero shows.Fox on the other hand seems to do a way better job with superhero shows just look how great of a job the channel does with the show Gotham.

"Supergirl",2017-09-02," I like this show but it is very flawed. It fails to make any tension or suspense which makes me feel uninterested. The romance in the show is also fairly bad, they spent an entire season building up to a James and Kara romance only to do nothing with it and I just don't really care about Maggie and Alex, it's just too rushed. The biggest problem however is that it uses the same plots over and over again. The show has a talented cast and despite what I said earlier I do like the characters but they have to stop making redundant plots. ","6"
"Supergirl",2017-08-28," I like female heroes, and I've been in waiting for many years since Wonder Woman, The Bionic Woman, and Charlies Angels went off the air, for one to appear.Well, this ain't it. I'm still waiting.Aside from the overly abused, gratuitous use, and sickening parroting of the word  family  in about every episode of the first season, I found it barely watchable. But, I decided to give it some time, seeing as some shows are slow to take root and grow.This one apparently got sick and died, and no one told them.Monotonous story lines, unimaginative dialogue, and a smart alec attitude from Super Girl does not make a good TV show. I mean, really.....she's on the edge of going into  mean girl  territory. She's already got the  I'm better than you  attitude going full blast. A smart alec attitude I might add, that makes her more easily hated than liked. She has been confronted many times about being biased and self-righteous, and throws a tantrum because she thinks she just so perfect, that she is above everything and everybody.And her egotistical attitude doesn't show any signs of subsiding. She doesn't show any signs of growing or even expanding her mind to even try to understand other peoples feelings and emotions. It's just  me, me, me .This show is more about a spoiled brat than it is a show about a benevolent, understanding hero.If you are bored with nothing better to do. Watch this. Otherwise, you are wasting your time. This is by no means any kind of superhero I'd be standing behind, much less allowing any children to watch. ","3"
"Supergirl",2017-08-28," Supergirl is the TV show that might not grab your attention immediately from its first episodes, but it certainly grows on you. There are some chiché moments along the way, and yes, it sometimes reminds you repeatedly that the female lead characters struggle to work in a world that's ruled by men, however, when you think about it, everything they say is true. Most characters are female, but why is this really a bad thing? Aren't most TV shows' characters male? What's the problem in having a show with slightly more female characters than male characters? Sadly, people's discomfort with this comes from a problem within our society, not the TV show itself.By the time you finish watching the second season, you should be left with a feeling of nostalgia (this coming from someone who never read the comic books as a kid, which means that the show was successful in attributing a homey, nice vibe to itself). The reason I won't give this a higher rating? The special effects for supergirl's flight could be better. Otherwise I'd give it an 8.Can't wait for season 3. ","7"
"Supergirl",2017-08-27," I gave this show 2 out of 10 because I did enjoy the 1st season. It was fun watching supergirl figure out how to use her powers as she became the super hero. Unfortunately, the 2nd season completely destroyed the show.The 2nd season ditches the premise of being a show about a super hero who is out there fighting bad guys and turns completely into a liberal propaganda show. I read a couple other similar reviews and hoped that it was just a few comments here or there in the show that didn't distract too much from the regular show. But no, they devote whole episodes to obviously pushing liberal agendas. It was such a huge disappointment that I quit watching and actually created this IMDb account just to post this review about it. Supergirl needs to be neutral and stay out of politics! The 2nd season should change the title to Super social justice warrior. It's just awful. ","2"
"Supergirl",2017-08-21," Lets just get this out of the way...the Kara in CW's  Supergirl  is nothing like the comic version. With that being said, I was still okay with Season 1. It definitely had its cheesy moments, and it took me a while to get over how stark of a difference this  sunny  version of Kara was from the dark, more tortured soul Kara in the actual comics. But overall, it was entertaining enough. And then Season 2 happened...Season 2 was turned into a bad romance soap opera saga with little character development for Kara and the incessant shoving of the non- heroic Mon-El in our faces. Those familiar with the comics already know that the Mon-El depicted in the show is nothing like the Mon-El we know from the comics. Not only that, but he and Kara never had a romance. I get that these shows aren't going to follow the comics every time. But why were we given a sexist, disrespectful frat boy version of Mon-El in a show that likes to tout itself as being  feminist?  Because there was absolutely nothing feminist with how Mon-El treated Kara throughout Season 2. Frankly it was insulting to watch their poor excuse of a  romance  play out when he did nothing buy disrespect her, disregard her advice, spew out sexist after sexist comment, and argued with her incessantly. It was flat out gross to watch. Kara didn't grow as a character in Season 2. Instead she got dragged down by Mon-El and was reduced to being the love interest even though she's supposed to be the main character of her show just so that a spoiled man-child could be propped up as  heroic.  Which, by the way, Mon-El never once proved he was a hero. Instead we were just told over and over that he was and that he had changed without any physical storytelling proof. There were so many plot holes that were never resolved. One good thing Season 2 had going for it was the CADMUS story line. But that never played out. Katie McGrath's Lena Luthor was really the only character that kept my watching. And unfortunately, I don't think she will be enough to keep me watching Season 3 since the powers that be think that Mon-El is an awesome character and will continue to be a part of Supergirl. No thanks. Here's a clue, heads of CW, Supergirl show runners and writers, just because two actors are dating each other, it doesn't mean a bad story line that has gotten plenty of media and fan backlash is  the right story to tell.  But have fun continuing to lose viewers with that way of thinking. Because I, for one, won't be tuning in to see more of the Mon-El show! ","1"
"Supergirl",2017-08-19," This show is basically  Let's shove the pro-LGBTQ lifestyle in people's faces , with some aliens here and there. I mean, while I may not agree with that crowd's lifestyle choices, I do agree it's their choice to make. Where I draw the line, however, is when those lifestyle choices get incessantly shoved down the throats of viewers. Why does this ~4% minority get such a disproportionately-large representation in Hollywood?Also, in this show, the pseudo-liberal,  Anything goes<U+0097>as long as you don't disagree with us  viewpoint reigns supreme. Anyone with traditionally-conservative points of view is depicted as a malicious, evil monster.If that's the auto-delusional echo chamber you want to inhabit in your downtime, then this is the show for you. Literally the ONLY reason I've watched past the first few episodes were the inevitable crossovers with Arrow/Flash/Legends. I'm no longer sure it's worth continuing doing so. ","3"
"Supergirl",2017-08-02," Supergirl had so much potential to be a show women and young girls could really look to for strong, inspiring female characters and representation. Unfortunately, it failed miserably with that in Season 2, and Supergirl is definitely not someone I'd ever aspire to be as an empowered woman. What prompted me to get on here and do a review was the latest ridiculous defense of the one of the BIGGEST problems of the show...Mon-El, by one of the CW's top executives. Despite the known backlash of this character, he basically said that Mon-El will remain an integral part of Season 3 because the two actors that play Kara and Mon-El are dating in real life and that it's the  right story to tell.  Ummmmm...okay, really? So the right story to tell is one of letting a complete misogynistic, disrespectful, egotistical poor excuse of a man get the girl (who happens to be the lead character) all while also completely taking over the story line so that most of the fandom kept referring to Supergirl as  The New Adventures of Mon-El?  And you should keep Mon-El on the show because the actor is dating the lead actress? Yikes! Talk about being out of touch with just how much Mon-El was disliked as a character. It's no secret that I despise Mon-El's character. The way the writers continually allowed Kara to be berated and disrespected by him was very offensive and not at all what the Kara from Season 1 would have put up with, especially if she had still been with James. Speaking of James...an overly glossed over point it seems is how they abruptly did away with the Kara and James relationship for no apparent reason and then immediately had her get with a white boy who used to own slaves. So...apparently the writers also don't have a problem with slavery and the racist undertones that had. Just another lovely tidbit...which I see other fellow reviewers have also commented on. The  right story to tell  also involved Mon-El telling Winn after Kara still wouldn't get with him that he missed being on Daxam where he could objectify women and just not care. THAT'S they kind of character you want representing your show? Well guess what, that's not what I want to watch. And I won't be tuning in for Season 3. Oh, and the endless political propaganda that I spoke of in the title, that pretty much speaks for itself in most of Season 2. I have no party affiliation. It was just annoying to be continually beaten over the head with the writers' political views. The CW's version of Supergirl is not something to be proud of...unless the writers, producers, and network executives are proud of propping up a horribly written male character that undermined the leading female character and essentially took over her show. If that's that what they were going for, then kudos to them for turning what could have been an empowering, strong female character into an unrecognizable, shell of a girl who is by no means any kind of super heroine I'd want to look to for inspiration as a woman.And I'll just leave it at that, because if I get started on the lazy writing and major plot holes that never got resolved, this review will become a novel! ","1"
"Supergirl",2017-08-02," Season One was OK.... Season Two is a constant barrage of SJW propaganda from  madame president  pushing for alien amnesty to lesbian acceptance with a dose of climate change and evil human polluters for good measure. You can definitely tell the episodes were written when the authors were certain Hillary would be president.... lol ","3"
"Supergirl",2017-08-01," I gave the show 2 stars instead of 1 because I did enjoy Season 1. I've never been a fan of comic book television or films, but I gave Supergirl a shot since we rarely see female led shows...let alone a female-driven superhero show. So I was pleasantly surprised by the first season. It wasn't perfect by any means. But it was enjoyable to watch and had plenty of strong women from Supergirl herself to her sister Alex to Lucy Lane and the  Queen of all Media,  Cat Grant. Where Supergirl went horribly wrong was in Season 2. From inconsistent writing with way too many plot holes (even for a superhero show) to the majorly problematic character of Mon-El. In fact, Mon-El is why I won't be watching Season 3. Because you see, after all of the backlash from fans and even countless articles done by entertainment media outlets outright stating that Supergirl's problem was too much Mon-El, the show-runners are blatantly ignoring that and bringing him back for Season 3. And let me guess...they are going to tout him as a newly changed man and a  hero.  I wasn't watching Supergirl because I wanted a misogynistic douche-bag of a dude-bro not only taking over the show that's supposed to be about Kara, but also reducing Kara to being his love interest. So...what was the problem with Mon-El, one might ask? Well, we could start off with how he missed objectifying women back on his home planet because he was irritated that Kara didn't want to get with him. And that came after he'd already been disrespectful to her on countless occasions. Kara told him on numerous occasions that they weren't a good match, but he kept pursing her and eventually tried to guilt her into not liking him back by throwing out an I love you. And when they did eventually get together (because this is the CW and of course the lead female can't be without a guy), seconds after she asked him to keep their relationship on the down-low, he announced to the whole DEO that they were together, which was just...gross, not to mention highly disrespectful of Kara's wishes. We were told on numerous occasions that Mon-El had changed, but were never shown it. He fixed Kara breakfast and that apparently warranted him being a  changed man.  Wow...the expectations are very low with this one, I tell ya. And by the end of the season, even though he kept telling anyone who would listen that he was also a hero, it was Kara that had to tell him to  go be a hero.  There a countless more situations I could discuss, but the point of the matter here is that Kara was reduced to being the love interest in her own show. And we could get into how the writers decided to break up Kara and James before they even had a chance at a relationship and then replaced James with a boring, sexist white guy who also owned slaves...seriously, ya can't make this up. I was thrilled to hear that Katie McGrath was going to be in Season 3 as a regular, because I loved Lena Luthor's character. In fact, she was the only good thing about Season 2, to be completely honest. But unfortunately, not even Ms. McGrath can get me to watch again when they intend to bring Mon-El back and pretend like there was absolutely nothing wrong with the way his character was written. If you're looking to feel inspired by strong women, Supergirl is not the show for you. I'd recommend  Wynonna Earp,   Orphan Black,  and even a new show called  The Bold Type  instead. Save yourself the frustration of seeing Supergirl/Kara fall by the wayside so that a good for nothing frat boy could take the lead and destroy anything good the show had going for it. ","2"
"Supergirl",2017-08-01," I really enjoyed Season 1 of Supergirl. Sure, it had its flaws. But overall it was empowering and had plenty of strong, female characters, which is something we don't get so see a lot of all in one show. Then Season 2 happened. And I had to watch as a spoiled, self- entitled, sexist frat boy not only take over the show, but also get to be Kara's love interest. And sadly, his character pretty much took over the show. Not only did Mon-El disrespect Kara on numerous occasions (sometimes in front of her co-workers), but he was full of sexist gibes. The writers literally had him say that he missed objectifying women and not caring when he was on Daxam. How do you have the nerve to tout your show as feminist and empowering when the main character's love interest is saying things like that? It was appalling. The only saving grace of Season 2 was Katie McGrath's Lena Luthor. And I was going to stick around for Season 3 for her even though I knew they were going to bring Mon-El back despite the majority of the fandom and countless media outlets called out the show for having a Mon-El problem. But after the cast mocked a part of the fandom that shipped Lena and Kara together, it's clear they think too highly of themselves and do not respect the fans. So I won't be watching Season 3. And after the messy debacle that was Season 2, I'd say I'm much better off finding a show that appreciates its fans and also doesn't insult female viewers by claiming to be empowering when we had to watch our female heroine get put down time and time again by a toxic male character while trying to tell us that he'd changed and Kara made him a better man. Because one...he didn't change. And two...it's not a woman's job to make a man better. So I'd say watch this show at your own risk. Or just skip it all together. There are plenty of other shows out there where the cast appreciates and validates their fans and where female characters are allowed to be strong and heroic without having to deal with sexist, disrespectful supporting characters! ","1"
"Supergirl",2017-07-30," I had no desire at all to watch this show. Actually, the only reason I started was because of The Flash. I was really surprised at season one, though! There were some quirks that got on my nerves (like everyone constantly referring to Clark Kent as her cousin and reminding us every five minutes that Kara is a female...), but for the most part, I thought it was done pretty well! Then season two came around... And everything went downhill. Just to start eith, there's the overuse of the name  Supergirl  (like, Kara refers to herself in third person), all the relationship drama, everything being overly  pc -- and the political agendas,references, and undertones (they LOVE the words  alien  and  refugee  and even tie them in to political story lines). A little but of that goes a long way. ","6"
"Supergirl",2017-07-29," I enjoyed season 1. Season 2 just jumped into full on politics with the writers full on campaigning for Hillary Clinton. They don't even try to be subtle. When I want politics, I watch the news. I think Supergirl has tremendous potential and they have the perfect actress for the part. Get different writers and lay off the politics or this show will wind up in the dust bin, which I would hate to see. I'm watching on Netflix and not even sure I'm going to make it through season 2. Stop trying subliminal mind control and just entertain! ","2"
"Supergirl",2017-07-20," Supergirl.... Super!??That S on her chest. Mark of the house of El (Hope) The honor of having the privilege to carry that mark as the protector of the whole world in theory but in fact maybe just the USA. They being the one and the same to some people according to the movies. Mostly.I'm a huge Superhero fan but I don't like to put myself in to a box with anything in this life. I'm not a DC fan or a Marvel fan but a fan of good and enjoyable art in the form of a motion picture. Okay maybe the most enjoyable movies and TV generates around the superheros.Mostly I like the ones without any powers but only some gadgets and the raw skill of martial arts. Batman, Nightwing, Arrow, Celina Kyle, Electra, Talia al Ghul, Agent romanoff....That's 3 males and 4 female characters among the superhero worlds with some extreme skill. None of them can fly without an airplane assistance.Supergirl is a woman. They say it's not fair to compare man and a woman when it comes to combat and heavy lifting. Well in the real world at least.Before this show I thought, that the last son of The planet crypton was Carl El the last of their kind. The only hope of any cryptonians existing. Actually the last source of energy was deployed on Clarks ship (the codex) so that he could be sent to earth. But when the supergirl series started, the intro speech led me to understand that, Carls cousin a female cryptonian was launched to earth earlier to have the purpose of being his guardian and a guide. But then some rock in space knocked her shuffle out of course for some what 20 years and she got here much later when Clark was already a superman.Okay so why would we need another supersomething?There already is and has been a superman for a long time.Maybe for the sake of new entertainment? Okay I get it.Then why do they have to be related and from the same planet?Wonder woman is an Amazon brought to life by Zeus the god of thunder. Just an example.Why why why... Yeah okay so this is what we have now so let's examine what we got.We have a 13 year old teenage blondie dropped on to our earth from wonderland who's more of the time crying, complaining or just wondering herself while waving her hands all over the place. This little girl is so confused about everything that she needs to remind herself that she is a girl and that it is awesome that she is a girl and a super at that a superGIRL! No not a boy or a man but a GIRL!I mean if the show was called  The blondie in pink pyjamas with powers  only then I would need this information to know what to call her.. Well her name is Kara but I guess she remembers that cause shes not repeating:  I'm Kara ...Okay so this Kara was suppose to be more powerful than her cousin the Superman himself what I understood and boy have I ever been more misled and deceived! She get's her ass handed to her like all the time. There even was a scene where she willingly let a normal human being put a suicide helmet on her head and suck her dry of powers out of no reason at all. So shes also stupid.I have no idea what this piece of dirty and smelly sewer water of a series is doing representing the DC universe. A relative to the man of steel.Let's say in the world of TV series the Daredevil is an absolute masterpiece in characters, story, fighting and world.I must add that when Jimmy Olson changed in to the Guardian in supergirl. That was the finest moment of the whole series. But I predicted that they can't keep the guardian cause he would stomp over supergirl so hard that the name would have to be changed so Supergirl instructed that the Guardian can't co exist in her candy land of pink cakes and flowers and nail polish. Yeah I know.. Girls won't share and girls don't play it fare. Arrow and Flash have got their own teams and sometimes even they share the same enemies. But this stubborn little girl with blue laser eyes more wet than blazing all the time want's to lead without any confidence in herself. No this isn't Diana, not the Black widow or canary, not the Catwoman not Talia but just a lost girl without cause living in the city of the man of steel. What a pity cause a cousin of the Man of steel could of had some juice in the making only this is made for children.The fighting is awful just throwing always throwing someone on the wall or through or almost. The CgI looks awful.Man of steel -> Dawn of justice -> wonder woman -> Justice league -> supergirl!!! ERROR!!!Arrow, Flash, Legends, SupergiERROR! ","2"
"Supergirl",2017-07-18," I really tried, I watched the pilot when it first came out. My first thought was god this crap is awful, so 2 years later I decided to come back and watched it. I literally just finished season 1, and God its even worse. I love the whole equality feminism thing that they were trying (but obvi failed) they just really overdid it too much like 90% of the stuff just was too forced. Seriously, God is a she now... and a freaking woman president.... And, this show is super racist I swear those episode with Zhonn was literally breaking my heart. And that Kara and James thing I will never ship there is 0 chemistry in the mix at all. This show has no Latinos, no Asians no Indian no nothing except 2 black people and a billion while people wth so the whole city is a white place???? The fakish looking effects is awful. Storyline awful. Actors literally overacting smh. And, the self righteous crap is annoying.SPOILER ALERT...In episode 20 when Kara choose not to sacrifice 8% of the population to stop a major disaster. Just all in the name of hope... but, in arrow there were countless of times they had to do make extremely tough descions and still have hope. eg. when felicity had to redirect that bomb which was headed for their city.I also feel like there stealing other shows/movies ideas. example. 1x19 (myriad) when everyone minds gotten taken over... (DIVERGENT) and then Indigo looks a hell of a lot like Mystic.... AND LAST THE FREAKING BANSHEE.... TEEN WOLF!!!look I can go on all day on how awful this show is. I seriously hope it gets canceled mainly for the sexist content, bad material, racism and etc. I do not recommend watching this ever, even if you have a death wish. ","1"
"Supergirl",2017-07-09," I had good hope for this show and started watching it without reading any reviews, unfortunately i'm extremely disappointed. The story line is way to predictable and poorly written, the casting is bad and the special effects are appalling. Costumes of  aliens  and androids look like trash that would come in last on a high school cosplay competition. The acting is horrible, Melissa Benoist does quite well, but most of the other actors put up an extremely poor performance. And then there's the errors made by the director and production team, an elevator shaft that looks to go up at least 20 more floors even though they already are at the top floor. Every episode is full of stupid errors and inconsistencies, not even starting on the amount of stupidity they try to get away with if you take real life physics into account. All in all it's just a very bad show that would profit from a better director and writer. ","4"
"Supergirl",2017-07-09," I really enjoyed season 2 of Supergirl, as I finished it on Netflix last night. I thought Mon El brought some much needed charisma to the season, and Kara and him were at some points pretty hilarious together. Winn is always funny as well. The Character that really suffered to me this season was James Olsen. The Guardian, cool, but James Olsen lacked that likability. The finale was in my opinion very good. I mean c'mon, who doesn't want to see the two Kryptonians slug it out in slow motion in the rain?? Plus the return of a much missed blonde. Good season, better than season 1 in my opinion. ","7"
"Supergirl",2017-07-08," I started watching this show over a year ago and have enjoyed it! I so far haven't missed an episode!Pros: Its a family friendly show,The names were all right and displays great visual effects. It also can be somewhat inspirational towards kids,teens and even adults. It often shows that  Its never to late to change  or  You can do it don't give up . I enjoy and would like to become an actor so I know the difference between good and bad acting. Overall the acting is great but there is one thing that often I find wrong in the acting scenes. Cons: I have seen some sexist things in the show. When your engaged its hard to realize that almost all enemies are guys and rarely females. Some people (Like me) may find it offensive or against what they believe in when the show displays Gay relationships in season 2. Above I had said that the acting is great overall. If you pay close attention you will notice that the actors stutter or forget their lines but they do hide it very well. Near the end of season 2 Lilian Luther talks in a high pitched quick stutter voice and says (What the hell am I doing here!). ","8"
"Supergirl",2017-07-07," I wanted to like this show. I really did. I love Arrow. And the Flash got really good starting season 2. (Season 1 is a disaster IMO) Legends is not great but still watchable.But Supergirl....Wow. They should just call it SJWgirl. When will SJW's realize that cramming their beliefs down our throat only makes us turn away from their ideology? Trump is right. The entire media industry is controlled by out of control liberals. I've always been a moderate, but the more the media tries to brainwash me into their SJW agenda, the more I find myself becoming a hardcore conservative.I hope that someday feminists will realize that equality doesn't mean  give the men what they deserve  but that we treat each other with equal respect. ","3"
"Supergirl",2017-07-03," The second season is even worse than the first one. Unfortunately the series doesn't manage to make any connection with the characters, the writing is really bad. Unlogical plots, undeveloped character arcs and no meaningful story at all, just pathetic dialogues. At least some of the fighting scenes are quite OK. ","2"
"Supergirl",2017-07-02," I love comic book series. Though Supergirl wasn't really a true favorite of mine. Following the blatant over the top feminist superiority and extremely far left leaning political nonsense I simply can no longer support this show. Of course we expect a show like Supergirl to inspire our wives, our girlfriends, and our daughters. We want a show like this to show women can be bad ass heroes just like men can. But the over the top feminism ruins the show.Even if you overlook the over the top feminism, the writers are obviously angry democrats who cannot get over the fact that Hilary didn't win. Sure some references to our politics is warranted to make tie-ins to the real world. But here's the reality, the show is watched by Republicans, Democrats, and normal everyday people who really don't want to be annoyed by politics and just want to enjoy the show to get away politics.

"Supergirl",2017-07-02," why the hell is Jimmy Olsen black this BS is just like Annie she was Always white with red hair and suddenly they want a black Annie whats next black superman ? there are things you cant change because it would make no sense this is just superman but instead of man they replaced it with  girl  i can write series like that to i got a great idea a bat girl movie where she does the same as batman but instead of batman its bat girl couldn't go further then episode 1 i hear people say it gets better at episode 4 but if you ask can you skip the previous 3 episodes they say no because you cannot follow the story just skip this i don't think you will miss anythingif you really want to see a female super hero go see wonder woman instead ","1"
"Supergirl",2017-06-28," I love this show! I love that it encourages female power! Its interesting and has action/love etc. Love it! keep it going! It involves main characters that are females which is so important in todays climate. it involves science which is interesting. And most of it allows for people to enjoy outside the box thinking and believe in the super world. ","10"
"Supergirl",2017-06-27," Season two became offensive with the introduction of Alex as homosexual! Alex and Maggie are not the main characters! The Show is called SuperGirl not two gay girls! If Holly wood wants a show with gays then make a show with gays stop trying to push it into the classics! I've stopped watching most of season two and I actually caught the season finally and was really disappointed that Mon El had to go but they kept Maggie and Alex's fake relationship! ","1"
"Supergirl",2017-06-22," Melissa could've been a good super-girl but instead we got this but if you've wanted a version of the lovable, freckled and funny Jimmy as a buffed up, cocky dude, an annoyingly cute Kara, a show with poor writing, crappy plots, questionable casting choices and uninteresting characters, then try this one out.

"Supergirl",2017-06-18," Yes, I get it: If you're an American conservative, you're going to hate this show. And if you aren't open to changing your mind about anything, you shouldn't even watch it.And, although the agenda being pushed unsubtly by the show is definitely on the liberal end of the American political spectrum, most of it would be considered mainstream in the rest of the free world. Feminism, normalization of homosexual relations, climate change, gun control, immigration, and even some sly digs at Donald Trump, are all there. But note that several of the bad guys are actually extremist environmentalists.I suspect that much of the criticism of other aspects of the show: the dialogue, the acting, the plots, even the fight scenes, is caused by the reverse-halo effect, whereby, something one finds undesirable causes one to see only flaws everywhere else.Personally, I found the dialog, especially the banter between the characters, believable, but not to the point of being too obvious or stereotyped. However, I concede that in the more serious intimate scenes, there did seem to be rather too much of  I believe in you ,  You need to believe in yourself , etc., and also an unrealistic emphasis on characters lives being totally dedicated to the  protection  of other ones. Why anyone would  protect  another character by recruiting them into one of the most dangerous jobs on the planet is beyond me! As is why characters invulnerable to practically anything except Kryptonite would need especial protection. I found the acting to be good; in fact, I didn't even notice the acting most of the time: generally a good sign. The only character who didn't work for me was Superman: maybe the acting, maybe the casting, maybe just his appearance, didn't work for me.It was interesting to see some  bad guys  with noble agendas, not just out for world domination or revenge. This led to some genuine debate between the characters.Melissa Benoist is cute, funny, likable, and surprisingly vulnerable emotionally, and anchors the show very watchably.The frequent cases where ties of family and friendship led to violations of national security, apparently without penalty, were particularly unrealistic; but the whole show demands considerable suspension of disbelief anyway.Some have criticized the misandry (man-hatred) of the show. I think this is hard to support: there are several very strong, highly admirable, male characters. Also, there are far more cruel, ruthless female characters than male ones. As a father, myself, I do sometimes find the portrayal on TV of fathers, to be outrageous. This seems to happen mainly in animated shows for children: examples include 'Fairly Oddparents', 'The Amazing World of Gumball', and 'Johnny Test'. At the worst, the Dad is lazy, feckless, and severely morally compromised, while the Mom is the opposite. 'The Simpsons' is like this too, but the intelligence and wit of the show just-about make up for this. However, I felt no such outrage at the portrayal of men in 'Supergirl'.Some have said that every character is judged by how they relate to Supergirl. In fact, she is not shown as perfect: in one scene, when her own moral compass is compromised, it takes a male character to show her what she should do. There are other scenes where a steadying male character has to overrule an over-emotional and out-of-control female one.Some have criticized differences from the original comic books. At the age of 9, I was an avid reader of DC's 'Superman', 'Action', and 'Adventure' comics, spending all my meager weekly allowance on them. I was not so much a follower of Supergirl, but I'm very familiar with the Jimmy Olsen figure. But, you know what? This is a reboot: it's dragging the characters over 50 years forward in time: there was no internet, blogging, or cell phones, in those days. Just don't think of 21st Century James Olsen as the same as 20th Century Jimmy Olsen. Also, the many references to real-life people, although repeated to the point of self-parody, serve to anchor the show firmly in the 20-teens.I was surprised at the number of vulnerabilities the Girl of Steel supposedly has: ones that I don't remember from the comics; but in a series this long, if she can't be hurt by anything other than Kryptonite, then in order to maintain the dramatic tension without being tiresomely repetitive, there have to be several ways to hurt or limit her.There's a huge amount of hand-to-hand combat, with the frequent cliché of a character being slammed into something massive and destroying it.I will say that the rapid sequence of love-interests was rather unrealistic, and frustrating; and the reason given for cutting some of them off bizarre:  The Universe seems to be telling us something .I didn't like the way some episodes ended with  to be continued on 'The Flash' , as Netflix didn't provide that continuity. This may explain why a serious rift between two characters was entirely mended by the start of the next one.I started overhearing the show as my 12-year-old binge-watched it, then I watched some of the later episodes with him. After that, I was hooked, and at the time of writing, I've seen almost all of them.Added 7/5/2017: It seems three people found this review unhelpful: Since I advised conservatives not to watch the show, I guess they must be conservatives who liked the show, after all.

"Supergirl",2017-06-17," I'm going to be honest. I started watching this show because Agents of Shield is currently on break. However, I stayed because it is actually really fun. Are there things that are bad? Absolutely. The script can be downright cringe-worthy at times. The effects are generally okay, but there are times when the CGI is awful. The plot is also extremely convoluted and wandering. It seems directionless at times. The show can also be exceptionally cheesy/campy at times. HOWEVER-The characters that they develop here are absolutely fantastic. I love the sisterly relationship between Kara and her adoptive sister. I love the owner of the newspaper she works at. She has exceptional depth, and is just a badass. I love the Elon Musk-esque super rich guy (Lord is his last name I believe). His backstory has heart and his motives are easy to understand. The controversial character is, of course, Jimmy Olson. I understand that he is not the same character from the comics, or the old Superman movies. Myself not being a particularly large DC fan, and not being a reader of comics in general, I had no problem with the character of Jimmy Olson. He's funny, useful, interesting, and well-acted.I also really appreciate the tone the show takes on. Marvel's Netflix shows, as well as DC's most recent movies and TV shows, have an exceptionally dark and depressing tone. Some people enjoy that, and that's fine. I am not one of those people. I enjoy that this show is fun, that it is just a good bit of escapist entertainment. I can watch it for hours and not feel fatigued.Overall, I really enjoy this show. It has its faults, for sure, but in general it is a fantastic time. ","8"
"Supergirl",2017-06-16," I started watching the Arrowverse with the Flash and Flash was an incredible 10 out of 10. I'm a superhero fanatic so i really appreciate what DC has done (shout out to Greg Berlanti). Then I start catching up with all the shows in the Arrowverse by season 3 of flash. Arrow is great, I'm in the middle of season 4 and i still enjoy it. I'm actually watching in chronological order and the first few episodes of Legends leads me to believe that i will enjoy it as much as flash and arrow. Arrowverse hit a niche when Supergirl came along. There were only a few episodes that were very enjoyable (can't recall the exact ones). I wanted to get through Supergirl so bad because I'm dedicated to the Arrowverse but after the  Bizarro  episode i had enough. I guess this show is missing something. Maybe Cat Grant is annoying or maybe they need some different characters to buffer up the show. Flash is comical, fun to watch, and just a great well rounded show. Arrow gives you that batman feel. Its also fun how they introduce new characters to spin off shows as well as flash. Legends, obvious there is history with the characters and we expect a lot from them which i think they exceed expectations. Supergirl doesn't have nothing to pull me in. I stopped watching it for the moment, don't know when i'm coming back to it maybe next year when i find out there are some more crossover episodes in the Arrowverse with Supergirl or maybe when the Live actions titans confirm that she will be in it 2018. ","6"
"Supergirl",2017-06-16," I really like super hero stuff and wanted to like this show. I love when they do those cross over episodes and so decided to give the rest of this show a try...Finished the second season and can say with utter surety that this is the worst written show I have ever watched. This show makes Sense 8 look smart and well put together.There are some decent characters and performances, but the writers can't seem to decide who they want the characters to be. Every single character seems to wildly fluctuate between being though as nails, take no prisoners war machine, then suddenly a weak little kitten unsure of their place in the world.The plot lines are completely over the top lacking any subtlety or nuance. They beat you over the head with it. The alien invaders saying they're going to  make Earth great again  for example. It's not even done intentionally bad, like Legends of Tomorrow will sometimes do, self deprecating humor...no, they think they're actually being witty with these lines of dialogue and stories.The president turns out to be an alien who assumed the identity of the president, but it's OK because she's still a Democrat and wants to help. I'm not making this up. The entire team even agrees to join a conspiracy to help cover up this alien's crime, not treating it like a major breach of security, democracy, and the entire security of the planet...no...it's no biggie.Saying this show's writing lacks talent is an understatement. ","2"
"Supergirl",2017-06-14," I really enjoyed Ms Flockheart's roll as Cat Grant as she is fun, sassy, adds depth to the show and makes it fun and enjoyable to watch in a show that could not be made without the action and violence scenes that without it would make the show fluff and boring. Cat Grant role is a breath of fresh air and great they are bringing her back from time to time to invigorate the show. I hope she enjoys the role and showed me that she is a very interesting actress and I will be looking at other roles she has already completed and into the future. Great job Ms Flockheart and thanks for your interesting contribution to the show and bravo to the writers for having such a sassy and promising character. I do love they way she puts a moral to the story..BRAVO!!! ","10"
"Supergirl",2017-06-14," This show made me shiver out of the awkwardness of the script. At first, I became incredibly bored with the show and turned it off after the second episode, forgetting whatever second chances I had in mind for this show. Until my sister began to watch it again and I had no choice but to watch it with her. Everyone seems to think 'oh, it gets worse,' and by season 2, it does get much worse. Much, much worse. Even the cliffhangers, like the woman who owns that anti-alien group that I can't spell captures Mon-El and Supergirl, all I thought was 'lame' and 'really, this is the best cliffhanger you could do?' so I am still watching it, but don't expect anything too spectacular off of this show, because you aren't going to get much enjoyment out of it. Even the so-called suspense is blunt and boring. Sure, it makes you think what happens next, but does it really make your heart race, wondering what will happen to the protagonist? Or does it have great twists that you never saw coming that made the movie,  The Dark Knight  so great? Surely some of these new shows that are made should know that great twists are what people are looking for nowadays! This show is so predictable, I could see the twist that Mon-El was the prince practically a mile away! And the script, I constantly know what everyone will say next. This is just because of the writers and directors in this part, but they are so set on the heroes having mercy for the antagonists that they let them live and never kill them. But, they have left out a crucial element to this show: the human nature does not always have mercy. If they wanted the script and the story to at least be a little more realistic, having some of the antagonists killed more often. In the beginning they did that more often, and had Astrid, Supergirl's aunt killed, but besides that, there aren't really that many more antagonists killed. But what I really, really, really hate the most about this show, is that they let the character Cat Grant leave for a long period of time. She was my favorite character, being that woman who plays tough but is really a softy on the inside. She was probably the only thing that kept me watching the show! When she left, the show got quite tedious to me.The 2nd to last episode of season 2 Cat Grant comes back, but for that long time period when she was gone, Supergirl probably lost some significant viewers. So, overall, this show deserves a 5 out of ten, because it is simply too boring to make people wonder what happens next and gets more boring the more you watch. ","5"
"Supergirl",2017-06-13," They ran out of any good plot lines and has turned the show into a platform for social justice issues such as homosexuality and global warming topics. Once a good show which had the comic book appeal and now very little super hero and more super boring. We stopped watching this once family friendly show ","2"
"Supergirl",2017-06-09," The political messages are abundant and if you are not bothered by watching MSNBC, CNN or ABC messages in a show, go for it.The term   white privilege  appears at an average of about every two episodes without ever defining it. I am white too, but my ancestors were slaves for 400 years, how exactly am I privileged. Not everyone is a white American and even if you are the term is completely nonsensical, implying that somehow the above group is responsible for crimes of their (possible) ancestors. Of course slavery started in Africa but of course this is antithetical to the progressive message.Then we have the classic all inclusive message. Aliens are going to destroy Earth, the General says you cannot reason with them because they are dangerous ideologues who only want to kill, but supergirl team fires him and instead adopts a  listen and love  approach claiming that ideology will in fact save the world! Yes, let us welcome all failed ideologies, Nazism, Communism, Extreme Islamism, and of course, now,  progressivism  In other words, let's let all the terrorists in, try to love them more and that will make them not kill us, because love wins....Then we have the sexist approach that suggests that actually women are not equal to men, but in fact superior and I don't mean supergirl and her powers. No, I mean every woman in the show out thinks and outsmarts the  guys  exponentially ( the term is in quotation because every male actually is competing in who will be the most feminine and therefore easiest accepted by feminist viewers, no one really behaves like a man.) After those lost 20 minutes of my life, I will never watch again, in hopes you will not either. ","1"
"Supergirl",2017-06-08," There really isn't anything controversial about not liking idiotic dialogue, underfunded key special effects, poor character chemistry or a cheesy, meaningless villain of the week format. It's just, well<U+0085>boring.I am a huge fan of the Supergirl character but the show is clueless on how to present her. Instead of the brash, head-strong, reckless, arrogant Kara, we are given a female version of Clark Kent. And of course since we have a female Clark Kent on our hands, the writers attempt to adapt SUPERMAN stories to a Supergirl character. Plus no offense to Melissa Benoist but she is not right for that role with her look and mannerisms. Laura Vandervoort's portrayal as Kara on Smallville was a lot more accurate and she had the look (I'm sorry they put you in that horrible depiction of Indigo).Viewers have been exposed to the likes of Smallville and Man of Steel with their special effects and fight sequences. Why Supergirl has taken a step back from these examples is beyond me but it makes unpleasant television. ","1"
"Supergirl",2017-06-06," Love it. Should have more episodes with some with even more back-stories. Good start with introduction of new characters to the show. Should have more story about supergirl, her family, kal-el etc.maybe even some with episodes that clashes with supergirl and superman. Could also introduce more kryptonians (General Zod, Lex Luthor) etc. All in all, really great show. ","10"
"Supergirl",2017-06-05," Nothing entertaining about this. All about liberal feminism. Completely bias, too political. This is without a doubt the WORST thing to ever be televised. It's supposed to be for kids but if you don't mind your children being exposed to sex and lesbian sh*t then you'd be better off letting them watch south park. When they had Supergirl in smallville they didn't have to be all about feminism to show that she was a bad ass, unlike this train wreck of a show. I'd rather watch flies f*ck than suffer through another episode. Cancel the show. It's HORRIBLE ","1"

"Supergirl",2017-06-01," I thought the first season of Supergirl got better as it went on which in the end got me pretty excited for this season. But this season in my opinion fails to deliver and is a disappointing second season. The premise of the season sees kara attempting to help aliens live on earth without getting prosecuted by humans and other aliens. Melissa Benoit plays Supergirl in this show and I thought she did an alright job, at times she brings a lot of depth to the character especially to the dramatic parts of the season. However, especially at the beginning part of the season I found her actually quite irritating and annoying as she acted better then everybody else and it was really hard to care about her. There is a large supporting cast with a couple of standouts, first of all was Chris wood as Mon el, I really found him fun to watch and I really did like his character progression throughout the season. I thought him and Benoit had really good chemistry this season as well as I cared about there dynamic for sure. Alex danvers was a pretty decent character in the first season but she really shines this season as I really did care about her personal discovery this season and found it one of the more fascinating parts of the season. However, I found most of the other characters annoying, winn and James side story was pretty dull and felt really tacked on which felt tacked on. For the first half is the season the show focuses on Cadmus and the luthors and I found both of them particularly uninteresting. The story has some decent drama to it especially with some of the dynamics between a few of the relationships that i did like. However, the overall villain plot of this show is very weak and not interesting, there is nothing particular that stands out and makes you care about it. The script again has some decent dramatic dialogue in it as mentioned before which helps build the relationships. The humour last season was very cheesy and it really didn't improve enough to take it seriously as a fun show. The style of the show does have some spectacle to it and I did like seeing the grand nature of the show. However, similar to last season I found some of the action scenes as very by the numbers and this season doesn't improve and even regresses a bit. Overall this show isn't particularly interesting and the thing that keeps me interested is the fact that this show is in the same universe as other better shows but Supergirl really needs to improve to keep me on board for season 3. ","5"
"Supergirl",2017-05-28," The show has its merits. Supergirl battles bad people. But, I think the writers miss the point about Supergirl. She is older than Superman, smarter than Superman, wiser than Superman and has a full handle on her Kryptonian powers. The fact that she looks younger than Superman is a bonus due to her 17 years in the pod while traveling to Earth. She came to earth to  protect  her younger cousin. Even though she looks young, she is far older, when she puts on her costume. At her best Supergirl is a warrior, at worst a warrior mom. But, Hey, its TV. I believe  Cat Grant  is the real star of the show because she exhibits the maturity that Supergirl should have. On the other hand Superman is just a lisp away from being flaming. Way to go Hollywood!! ","6"
"Supergirl",2017-05-28," OK this is not a perfect show, but if you enjoy the other superhero shows like Arrow and The Flash then you will like this one. Sure it can be cheesy and dumb at times like those shows but they are still lots of fun to watch. The show struggled in its first season because CBS was trying some new things, but once it went over to CW it got a lot better. Also before I say this I would like to point out that I am a man. I'm sick of seeing all of the reviews saying it's feminist propaganda. So because there is a strong female lead and occasionally shows support for women empowerment means it's propaganda and doesn't deserve a fair shake? Besides feminism doesn't mean women are better than men, it means they should be treated equally, and what's wrong with that? Welcome to the 21st century where women can do anything a man can, including leading a superhero TV series. This show represents that notion very well without beating you over the head with it. Melissa Benoist is an awesome Supergirl and the relationship she has with the supporting characters really make this show worth watching, especially her relationship with her sister played by Chyler Leigh. This is the Superman show we always deserved because it's much better than Smallville, but it just happens to be led by a woman, which is awesome. If you're a woman hating piece of garbage then you won't like it, but frankly nobody cares what you think. If you're looking for something fun, that doesn't take itself too seriously and has a wonderful cast of characters, then I'd recommend giving it a shot. ","8"
"Supergirl",2017-02-19," This is a very well done show. It has a good story lines and great casting. The only reason I gave it 9 Stars and not 10 is because I would LOVE to see celebrity cameo's by former DC comic movies. Examples, Margot Kidder (1980's Lois Lane) or the original Supergirl Helen Slater and ANY of the cast members from these films. As witty as her boss is and as many 'inside jokes' that they write into the script these celebrity cameos are very much appropriate. I LOVE that Netflix has this as an Instant Watch as that's the only way I can watch TV anymore with all the commercials. I hope this show goes on for years and years including epic episodes with legendary cameo's! Great Job! ","9"
"Supergirl",2017-02-19," It started a bit slow and clichéd. But it got better with the episodes. Kara is growing not only as Supergirl but also as a person. And I really like also the other women in the show both good and bad. In fact I like there are so many women even in the extras or just mentioned, like the POTUS is a she. Many of the other comments with one * are spitting venom because of all the women, I find it refreshing. And.... this Martian Manhunter is really good in both forms. :) What I don't like is that Supergirl is not that super in many occasions for dramatic reasons. For example she is supposed to be as fast as the Flash but when 3 people jump off a building she can only save two. Compared to Alex, her sister, is more of a  hero  going beyond her own capabilities quite often to save Supergirl. Season 2 starts with many changes, looking forward to see how it evolves. ","7"
"Supergirl",2017-02-17," It has been enjoyable following Supergirl's journey as she tries to manage her newfound persona and responsibilities, her relationships and her homesickness. HOWEVER, It feels like the writers have been slowly changing the indestructible woman into a walking, flying bundle of insecurities: - SPOILER ALERT -* RELATIONSHIP WITH SISTER: Whereas it is wonderful to see the  us against the world  spirit and recognize its roots in Kara's loss of family and the love that binds her to her earthly family, her sulking over her sister going to a concert with her own new girlfriend, thus blowing Kara's Earth-birthday plans (which she hadn't bothered to share with anyone, mind you!) struck me as rather childish. This is a woman who lost her home planet and has had to live through the hardships of making a life on Earth! She ought to handle disappointments better than a 3 year old.* ROMANTIC RELATIONSHIPS: Whether with James and recently with Mon- El, there's this  I want it - No, I don't want it - I like you a lot - No we can't be together  back and forth to her romantic interests that will give you whiplash. Sure, it's understandable that being an indestructible crime-fighting alien who's only been on Earth for a decade or so, may make romantic relationships complicated; but that's not what comes out at all: they've made her into a woman who can't make her mind up on what she wants, if anything out of these relationships.Same thing actually happened with Alex who literally broke up and got back together with her girlfriend twice in an episode. Same thing happened again with J'onn and M'gann. * DISCONTINUITIES: The writers seem to be just as unsure about story lines as Kara is about her relationships: Is Mon-El a superhero in training or was that just to shoehorn in another romantic dead end for Kara? Whatever happened to Lucy Lane and her father? They were super involved in 1st season. Haven't heard from them since!* THE DISGUISE: Really, the difference between Kara and Supergirl are the glasses and the cape. Honestly, the fact that those around her haven't clued in, especially the super-shrewd Ms Grant defies even the suspension of belief you need to enter a DC Universe.- CONCLUSION: It is wonderful that we are getting female superheroes, but rather infuriating that they can't be made into more than naive self-doubting bombshells, that only win every fight because the script says so. I'm sticking with the show, because I believe it really has some potential. I just hope the writers are able to explore the themes of alienation, responsibility, alter-egos and relationships in a way that rewards the viewers, especially female viewers, because I believe, worse than not being represented in the TV superhero pantheon, is being given a character that embodies all the not so flattering female stereotypes.

"Supergirl",2017-02-16," I usually give a show a lot of grace if there are really great qualities and/or ideas within that I truly love. At first I seriously thought this show kinda sucked. It was cheesy in presentation and dialog much of the time. Even my teenagers were unwilling to give it a fair go. However, I had already bought it on DVD, so I continued to watch it anyway. I waded through some pretty frequent bad acting and constant lack of creativity for a story line that was almost completely superman's in weaker female form. (Not being weaker because it's a female.) To my surprise, somewhere amidst my wading, I discovered that there was heart and beauty hidden within its many flaws. There have been many times in this 1st season that have really gotten to me. If the writers will find a way to bring more of this heart captivating beauty into a foundation for the show and if the actors can become grounded in it, then it could truly transform into quite a work of art. I wish them all the best & hope deeply that the cross over with Smallville that I've heard talk of is magnificent and won't disappoint. (Smallville was my fav!) ","6"
"Supergirl",2017-02-11," So, I watched the pilot when it came out first and it was so bad that I just couldn't bring myself to watch another episode. Then, recently, while watching the Flash I saw that it had a crossover with Supergirl, so again (the same as what happened with Arrow having a crossover with the Flash) I didn't want to miss any plot lines so I decided I'd force myself to catch up with Supergirl. The next few episodes weren't as bad as the first but I slogging on through regardless. A few more episodes in and I was actually starting to enjoy it, it seemed to be getting more like the Flash, the same easy- watching and same humour etc. I've just started the 2nd season now and I must say that if you're someone who likes the Flash, Arrow etc, and you didn't enjoy the Supergirl pilot, then it's worth giving it another chance. Watch a few more episodes... it does get better! ","8"
"Supergirl",2017-02-03," I felt the need to write this review to counteract some of the sexist crap that has been posted previously. This show, yes, can be a bit cheesy. But what show based on a comic isn't? What I find special about this series is it's willingness to show us that heroes are born female as well. But let me explain- this is in no way SAYING that men can't be good heroes and women are better than men. No, it's trying to show us the subtlety of the struggle a lot of women face when trying to make a name for themselves, and the lack of strong female role models we have growing up. Supergirl has always lived in her cousin Superman's shadow, finally realizing its okay to come into herself. And the Melissa Beloist who plays Supergirl is PHENOMENAL in the role. She feels so authentic, and is so relatable as the quirky yet fierce Kara Danvers. She shows us that it is okay to make a name for yourself, have strong female role models like her boss Cat, and have a loving relationship with your family while still being strong. I appreciate that a lot. I don't think there is anything in this show that promotes this  feminist agenda  people have been so harshly degrading it for. Yes, feminism is present as feminism simply means equality of opportunity. But what's feminist about it is Supergirl's journey to find herself separate from Superman's shadow, having a female boss who has power and understands how to use it, and having a sister who is as rugged and strong as the male-dominated field of national security that she works for. Supergirl is nothing without her team of friends to help her, showing that its not being female that makes her strong, its being able to accept help from others and find role models in men as well as women. I love this show and I think it deserves a chance. There aren't many out there like this that are willing to put their ratings on the line to give little girls an opportunity to see that you can be a woman and save the world. ","9"
"Supergirl",2017-01-31," This show shouldn't be on TV. Especially with the other shows in Arrowverse that are really good, this just makes the whole DC universe look bad.The show is just a pathetic attempt to highlight 'Feminism' that is currently trending on media. This show lacks story, execution and the generic buzz. I would point out that Martian Manhunter is probably the BEST thing about this show. If you are a comic fan, this show is not for you. If you are somebody who likes TV shows, this show is not for you. IF you are here just to pass time, well there are worse shows out there.Wouldn't recommend though. ","5"
"Supergirl",2017-01-31," Stop making Supergirl look weak; Livewire should not be able to kill Supergirl with electricity; just ridiculous. And the way she gets beat up sometimes. I don't care the other aliens have powers too, for ....sake, she is a Kryptonia. Might as well take the show off the air. Her cousin, Superman, must really thinks she's weak. She's too girly too. She can be girly when on the job, but buff her up when she's Supergirl. The story lines are great. Can't wait to see why the one Alien in the episode that aired 1/23/2017 bowed to Mon-El. Thank you. Thanks for listening. Of all superhero's, Superman has always been my favorite. Maybe we could see a little more of Superman in her shows ","8"
"Supergirl",2017-01-30," In short, is Supergirl a must see? No, it's not. Watching it won't add anything to your life but on the opposite side, it won't take anything away either.The premise is interesting, and there aren't any Women led superhero shows so you have to take what you can get.It's not that it's so bad it's mind numbing. It could just be they are trying to be a basic show, but it starts off not making sense. *spoilers* Kara reveals she's an alien to a friend in the first episode because reasons. There was nothing pressing her, she just needed validation. I guess this makes her more human, but it also makes her a fool. The actual human heroes don't do this why does she? Then again, in episode 5 when trying to dispose of a bomb, she flies through the city instead of diagonally up and away from the city. So perhaps her characters is supposed to be a little... slow. But why does the woman hero have to be slow?As far as small problems, the show just introduces things and forgets about it. Like they will show the DEO posing as FBI one episode, and Kara being completely surprised by this the next, there being a mad bomber identified and his ex-boss (who is supposed to be a genius) walking right by him (not in disguise) but Kara's friend notices him from a far (there's more to this that makes even less sense), not to mention how the bomber go through security, the martian man hunter not using his powers effectively when he should or telling transparent lies the characters can easily check but he's oblivious, or the presence of other Kryptonians that have been on earth a while, but didn't go after Kara immediately nor can they easily handle her adult self in battle in spite of it being established that Kara isn't a good fighter. Or even robots going crazy for no reason loosing pieces of themselves that magically appear in the next scene because the doctor went crazy. *spoilers end* Just seems like lazy writing. The show is better than nothing and I'll continue to watch in hopes it'll get better. As long as you don't notice the little things then this is a great show. While I know there are many flaws in all shows, I don't care for them when they are this glaring. like when they are this glaring. ","5"
"Supergirl",2017-01-29," I have been a total super hero fan since I was 10. I was looking forward to this from the time I heard about it. DISAPPOINTED!. As they did in the later superman movies they seriously botched the costume. Supergirl's costume was sexy, this one is not. Seriously, black silk stockings and boots to the mid thigh? Further,she is not blonde as Supergirl is. Plus, she is a total wimp. I watched in dismay as a human punched her and knocked her down. I was equally dismayed when a crook grabbed a hostage and put a gun to their head while Supergirl stood ten feet away. She surrendered! Seriously, the character I am familiar with could have disarmed ten bad guys before any of them could pull the trigger, let alone one bad guy. The special effects are very good in my opinion. The best flying sequences for television I have seen to date. The settings are lavish and detailed. So it's not all bad. Thus the 4 out of ten rating.And now she has a ...gay sister... who is more capable than Supergirl herself as she has rescued her several times? And they both work for a  Martian?  Jimmy (James) Olsen is a masked avenger??? The same Jimmy Olsen who wore a specially made watch to signal Superman when he was in trouble? I think if you are going to make a series that follows an established story, by all means use creativity, But don't shred the original character for your own stories. Perhaps create your own character and put her in a world infested with aliens and dozens of surviving Kryptonians, put her in another dimension or another setting of some sort, but don't make her abilities change unless you have good reason to for the sake of the setting. People are drawn to the character as she is. Why else make a series about her? They made the same mistake with Smallville. For the first five to six years it was excellent as they stayed true to Superman, but then what happened to Superboy? As we all know, Superman went to his Fortress of Solitude right out of high school and stayed there for 12 years. Suffice to say the creators of Supergirl need to rethink what they are doing and get back on the  Super  track.I really don't mind the women's equality plug and the gay rights is OK to, but I don't think it should dominate the story to the point that it does. I know today's trend is toward  Girl  power and  Gay  power. So be it. My opinion is that they don't need to dwell on being politically correct to tell an entertaining story. And that's why the  super  fans watch the shows, read the comics, and spend millions at the movies, to be entertained. Final word, watch a few episodes and see if you agree, I'm finished with it. ","4"
"Supergirl",2017-01-16," I started watching the show because of @MelissaBenoist but now I'm completely in love. I love the characters, the story which means I love the writers, the directors, the actors and everyone involved with the TV show. The series is light, has comedy, drama and deals with contemporary issues. The two seasons are great and I honestly can not pick one or a favorite episode. The plots are great and the series deserves the third season, which will come in 2018. People can speak whatever they want because nothing changes the feeling of true fans of the series. So, I finish saying that who loves #Supergirl will continue to love and who does not love can happen to love a day or not. But that would be a waste, would lose the grace that the world has thanks to #Supergirl. ","10"
"Supergirl",2017-01-05," I ll start off by saying i never was a big comic book reader. As a kid I loved Batman (animated shows) and recently I stumbled across Arrow on Netflix. I was hooked. I watch all 4 shows and enjoy them for the most part. I don't care that the continuity is not spot on or anything like that. I like a fresh take on things a change here and there. I loved batman v superman and all the other dc films. But as good as this show is the PC crap needs to go. I have no problem with anything else. The show can be a great show! It doesn't need to tie in current events, politics, and racism towards white men. These things are getting old and people just want an escape from the world. You cant do that when its slammed back in your face every episode. I hope the writers get this hate out of there heart so i can enjoy a good show. Otherwise I ll just find something else to do with my time. ","5"
"Supergirl",2016-12-27," The best propaganda pieces all have one thing in common: the colors of its country's flag, claiming to be for patriotism, for America, even for world peace sometimes, in order to get its infantilized idea across, despite it being perceived as crazy by its target country, making no attempt to grow an audience of critical thinkers. I once said to an entertainer,  if you're gonna be wrong, at least be funny, Kevin  (I wonder if he actually read the message). Likewise, I want to tell the Feminist writers for Supergirl, that if you're gonna be wrong, at least be entertaining. Because Feminism is a dead-wrong idea- as many religions are. But feminist writers have created/taken part in amazing works of arts before:  Who Shot Johnny? ,  Jessica Jones ,  Mad Max: Fury Road , all beautiful creations I've read and watched twice. So is Supergirl wrong for having Feminist ideals in it? Nope. It was bad because:It was too friggin PREACHY!! You know how annoying and boring that gets?!?! It's free to keep its worldview of progressivism, but to just talk about it at random points without giving any good reason why...buzzwording, word vomit, pandering, virtue signaling, whatever, it's uncreative and therefore becomes BORING, which is the greatest sin a writer can commit. It doesn't matter if it's a show aimed at kids. They're kids, not idiots. Dr. Seuss is famous because he wrote messages that challenged both children and parents alike, while being under the guise of being a plain children's author. But writers nowadays only care about what SELLS easier more than what is GOOD, sometimes confusing the two as the same thing. CBS didn't pick up the character because she's actually good (she can be), they picked it up because there was a demand for a female feminist superhero, and Wonder Woman wasn't available (anymore). Supergirl has always been moldable. The viewing audience don't like her because she's good, it's because it's easy for women to fit into her shows (a blank slate, like Hannah Montana) and be as good as the big boys, all on a character that sports American colors, making it justifiable to boil down political/social issues into meaningless one-liners. Example:  She can't beat him.   Why, because she's a girl?  If by girl they meant 22-year-old with the mind of an adolescent, then yes. And sure, comedy is subjective...it was just never clever. The action was good until it became predictable. The older sister got lucky too many times, she should've been dead at episode 3. The plot was going somewhere good halfway through, then it just became a meaningless rehash of better show plots. Not much critical character examination. Way too much talk about meaningless romances. Character motivation wasn't always explained. Did they really have to make her appear great just because she was surrounded by weak people?I thought there were great moments in this show, *(spoiler alert): like when she was human for a day and at the risk of her life she convinced a robber to give her his gun. That was well-thought out.*Finale was mediocre. She didn't seem to care much for her Uncle, if that's where the struggle was.Maybe they did have a heart set on Supergirl...but they just treated even their target audience as stupid children who were gasping for self-esteem like they were running out of oxygen.  You can do it, because you just can!  What is that going to add to society? Is confusing impressionable young girls with identity politics gonna help anyone?This needs to be categorized in the same group that God's Not Dead 1 and 2 are in: Preachy, Propaganda, Rehashed pieces. Supporting this show by giving it high ratings or buying it when it comes out on DVD is sad (call it a guilty pleasure if you must), because this does nothing for the world except make people believe an ideology without actually thinking about it. I. Whatever entertainment value it has will be in your mind short-term; but It's mind-block on critical thinking can last a long time. At some point, Supergirl's High Priest, Cat Grant, said to Supergirl and The Flash and friends,  You all look like the cast of a CW TV show,  and the music and conversation played on as if it was hilarious. And I cringed so hard that it made me look to heaven, bend my knees against the wall, and say,  Lord, I must castrate myself. This world is too stupid now, I must castrate myself before it becomes worse.  And castrate themselves they should. ","3"
"Supergirl",2016-12-19," This show started out reasonably well in S1, with a few interesting characters to develop and a believable premise. Kara did the odd silly thing but the fact that she was new to the idea of the public eye could explain at least some of it.Now in S2, however, the writers actually expect the audience to believe that someone from Krypton, home to an advanced society where the likes of space travel was a commonplace reality, is a bona fide idiot.She'll willingly submit to three humans, all close enough to her to swat with a light backhand, because someone they have no hope of harming before she gets them all is supposedly under threat. She'll wait 5 seconds for a weapon that can harm her to charge, and give its wielder time to fire, despite him not being more than two metres away from her. She'll hover above perpetrators wreaking havoc so as to give them the opportunity to spot her and fire at her, rather than just go in and take care of business.She has also lost any and all reflexes she may have once had. I fear that's it for me in terms of Supergirl. It is simply too frustrating to watch. ","3"
"Supergirl",2016-12-14," (minor spoilers) Supergirl and Jimmy Olsen ? what a joke. No chemistry between them. Not even a real romance scenario outside  clichés . It's only there for anti-racist agenda. Why does Supergirls like Jimmy ? nobody knows ... ho wait, he has abs ! It's obvious when Blake Jenner her real husband in live comes in the show, suddenly, there are sparks. We hope that he stays but ...The show is obviously for teenager. Bearly watchable, even if getting a little better with time.No real innovations, no suspense even when there is a countdown.Good fun moment with Barry Allen. This episode, we feel like the actors are really having fun. ","3"
"Supergirl",2016-12-08," I have to say this. I know people may not agree, but I certainly think that this show is terrible. If you have watched Arrow and Flash, you will see the same set-up. Computer person, hero, hero's ally, persona, etc. Its the same formatting. Its just a combination format of Flash and Arrw. This show is way to cheesy, and only my 10 year cousin likes this show. This show doesn't live up to Arrow's first and second season or The Flash. If you want another hero show in the Arrowverse, try Legends of Tomorrow. Its not THAT great, but it definitely gives you a cozy vibe, rather than this, the same old same old. The main character doesn't even make sense most of the time. ","1"
"Supergirl",2016-12-01," As so many others here, I really wanted to like this series. Sadly, it's become nothing more than a millennial vehicle for the religion of AGW, rabid, yet sometimes stealthily introduced third-wave feminism, case- studies for the New Castrati metro-boyz, over-the-top cheesy-puppy dialogue, and overt lesbianism that has absolutely nothing to do with any workable story-line and serves only to push the identity politics and agendas of a studio management that dreams of a world comprised of diverse-for-diversity's-sake nightmare Enterprise bridge crews. We watched every episode, overlooking the mediocre acting and PC-ness as a simple act of escape-ism. But, we saw that as the second season unfolded, this silly show wasn't going to make it, alas and alack. When the producers and check-signers decided to actively use what could have been a really fun show to promote their own, tiny-fringe beliefs onto the rest of us - you know, the people who watch the adverts and spend the coin - it was time to switch it off and look elsewhere. So-called  progressive  propaganda and latent sexual identity issues indoctrination has no place in what is purportedly pushed as a prime- time kids and young-adult TV show. But, then again, that is how the left gets things done, isn't it?As the title infers, for us and many other people I've talked to, Supergirl jumped the shark in season 2, starting at episode 5.Too bad. It really could have been a fun ride. ","1"
"Supergirl",2016-11-30," Okay, I've read the reviews too.. My main complaint is that the writers seem to never have read any of the comics. Apparently unfamiliar with what the title  Super  refers to, they put an otherwise promising character into the most absurd situations. Supergirl is very nearly as strong as Superman, yes, but she is also just s fast. That means super- speed. Does  faster than a speeding bullet  ring a a bell? I watched as Suppergirl just stood by and watched a switch thrown in this last episode, the one used to activate the killing weapon. Just stood there as if she couldn't move. This is just bad writing, you writers. Super- speed, get it? She could have been there before that switch was thrown easily. Think of how the Kryptonians moved in  Man of Steel,  or  Smallville.  That's how Supergirl should move. Her reflexes match that. It's almost impossible to take any Earth-resident Kryptonian by surprise. So get with it. There are other plot devices which would be infinitely more interesting if writers just dealt with the character's powers instead of hobbling her this way. And, yes, this is written immaturely and unprofessionally. You don't have to write down to kids in the audience. They appreciate the mote intelligent story lines, so give it to 'em and save everybody the pain of watching these episodes. ","4"
"Supergirl",2016-11-29," SPOILERS (for anyone that hasn't watched the 11/28/16 episode)!No wonder CBS sent this turkey over to the CW station! OK. My kids love 'The Flash' TV show. It is really interesting (outside most of the soapy 'love stories'). I even like it to a point. However, the so-called  cross-over  episode pretty much spelled the death of 'Supergirl' show. Granted, I really haven't seen many episodes (the ones I have BORED me and my children), but with the much hyped event this week, I decided to see what was in store for 'The Flash'. Well, what was the  cross-over ?!? An out-of-place scene that looked to have been conveniently stuck within the episode (at the end?). It seemed to have been shot BEFORE any of 'The Flash' episodes this season. Uggh! So everyone sat through the entire episode? You mean little kids and teenagers whose parents aren't watching all of the lesbianism/out-of-closet/two-women-kissing scenes were subjected to that CRAPOLA? Really, CW? Luckily I was in the room and changed channels when the lesbianism poured through the screen! Yes, the CW decided that the series was not even worth the effort that it put 1 1/2 minute  cross-over  at the very end of the 'Supergirl' episode! That's right, ratings must be SO BAD that lesbianism for nearly 10 WHOLE MINUTES was MORE IMPORTANT for ratings than anything else! Wow!This episode should mark the death of this series on television! I will NOT return! Beware if you have small children, too. It is unforgivable to have them subjected to social issues that they have no business having to watch! ","3"
"Supergirl",2016-11-25," Season 1 had a very slow start but it did hook me in and encourage me give it a chance. Right from 'Go' it was campy, cheesy, cringe and quite frankly the last show I watch in my weekly lineup but at the end of the day I just had fun with it.Yes there is a strong female empowerment vibe going on, what with God and the US President being called 'She' by the characters but so what if it's a little feminist sometimes? It isn't stealing from the fun factor at all and her reason for deciding to use her powers for the first time in years was valid and the reason she kept doing it was because of the rush she got from helping people.Her reason for helping people is self gratifying, no doubt, but with all that risk and no reward I would at least want to feel good about doing it and when she fails on more than one occasion due to a lack of experience she does feel bad about it.The best character has to be Cat Grant, her bitchy but wise personality is perfectly written (thought not always expertly acted) and when she does be a little nasty she isn't doing it to be mean but to encourage self improvement in Kara's human life and by god thank you for making her wise without being all knowing.Jimmy Olsen however is a hit and miss, yes he's black when Jimmy is white but he's also just there for no reason except to be the Superman guy without including more major characters from the Superman franchise who would potentially steal the show. Even Quinn has a role with the group but all Jimmy has done is drop Superman franchise names and give advice. He isn't necessary yet but at least he isn't badly written.All in all I missed the cheesy Monster (or Alien) of the Week trope because lately it's been about dark tones with lots, if not excessive amounts, of gore.It isn't amazing but it's fun and Season 2 is, so far, better than Season 1... ","7"
"Supergirl",2016-11-24," In average it takes two or three episodes of a TV series for a person to love it or hate it, if by episode four you're not into it odds are you better watch something else... this one however, won me over from the pilot!The premise of Kara Zor-El trying to be her own hero and not just live under her cousin's shadow is astounding, but it wouldn't be anything special if it wasn't for the amazing talent of Melissa Benoist, who gives Kara such a humanity that is almost unprecedented even for the Comic Book genre, Benoist is so sincere when she plays the invincible Supergirl and at the same time the vulnerable Kara Danvers. But it is not just her, the whole cast is incredibly talented, and the scripts are sophisticated but emotional, the photography and FX are above average TV, it is really an incredible show to watch.The Geek fandom gets a bad rep when it comes to accepting female Superheroes, and the divide amongst the fandom caused by certain movie that should not be named didn't help. But in reality as a proud member of the Geek community I can attest that we absolutely love empowered female Superheroes; we live in the era of amazing female characters coming to life, characters like Black Widow, Jessica Jones, Wonder Woman, Quake, Melinda May... and now we have Kara Danvers, who is an amazing addition to the golden era to be a Geek.THIS is how you make a Superhero TV show, this is how you make an alien from another planet likable (I'm looking at you, Zack Snyder), this is how you make people believe that a woman can fly. ","10"
"Supergirl",2016-11-23," Bad acting, terrible writing, horrible CGI. Unless you're a 15 year old feminist, you probably won't like this show. There are parts of a few episodes that ate entertaining but for the most part its tough to get over the corny one liners, and bad acting. Its obvious goal is propaganda, when it should be about telling the story of DC hero's Like I said I would recommend it to a audience of 15 and younger. Traditional DC fans will not enjoy what they are doing with this show. I can't understand how thy can do a good job with the Flash, and the first few seasons of Arrow, but seem to not give a true effort with this one. ","1"
"Supergirl",2016-11-22," no joke don't watch it, i watched the whole of first season and i had to cringe through the terrible acting especially supergirl. If you do ignore me and try to watch it you will see every episode is bad and gets worse the story gets more crap as it goes along. i had to forcibly push myself to finish season 1 like whoever came up with this script should be fired and never allowed to work again in the industry i think any person with a brain can see how bad it is if you like this you need therapy seriously you are a messed up boring person if you like this seriesdo yourself a favour watch arrow, flash, jessica jones instead also if u like superhero stuff watch an anime called boku no academia now that is inspiring ","1"
"Supergirl",2016-11-21," This series caught my attention from two sources: one, from some of my own students, and two, from the negative reviews here about ''feminist propaganda'' that none of my students even mentioned. So here's my take: Yes, this is a TV show aimed at kids in their pre-teens or early teens. As such, it doesn't make sense to compare it to series such as Black Mirror or Sense8. It does, however, compare VERY well to similar shows, such as The Flash or Arrow. In fact, I think it's a great show for both boys and girls. There was not a single moment where I felt there was some sort of subversive feminist propaganda that some reviewers here mentioned so vehemently. I would even say that there wasn't enough of this so-called propaganda. Do some guys here have so little self-esteem that they feel threatened by a ''chick flick'' aimed at young teens? I think they should be more worried about shows like The Walking Dead (which I like, by the way).It's great that we now have a superheroine to offset the abundance of superheroes. I say, ''Make more of these!'' And yes, clean up a little of the corniness :-) ","10"
"Supergirl",2016-11-20," I was hoping for a show in the spirit of Wonder Woman. Instead as I get into the plot and lost in the pages of a comic all of a sudden out of the writing comes Captain Planet, or Captain Social Justice, or Lets make all the white male heterosexuals that tune in feel guilty! I can accept Jimmy Olson as a towering black dude that could clean anyone's clock vs the timid photographer that I grew up reading in the comics. I can accept the parallels to Superman after all the comics did similar and to this day I own many of them but can we just get down to having some female super hero kick- butt fun? It is not too late to save this series - I love the actors when they aren't spewing the DNC talking points or making far reaching comparisons to make a political point? I am so afraid that they are going to not only kill this show with their biased writing turning off half the viewers but will ruin it for any other hero programming that follows. Be a hero to all the viewers not just the MSNBC crowd. ","3"
"Supergirl",2016-11-19," Now starting its second season on The CW, Supergirl is one of my favourite shows. Its chief strength is Melissa Benoist as Kara Danvers aka Supergirl. I found her kind of annoying when she was on Glee (although she has a terrific singing voice) but Supergirl is perfect for her. Benoist imbues the character with a dorky adorable charm, yet also sells the action scenes.A big strength of the first season turned out to be Calista Flockhart as Cat Grant, whose snarky wit yet ultimately decent heart turned out to be a winning combination. The relationship between Cat and Kara (and Cat and Supergirl!) was really well handled.All of the supporting characters are charming and likable - although I still don't think they have done enough to make James Olsen anything more than eye candy yet. His upcoming season 2 story line as vigilante The Guardian isn't filling me with confidence.Chyler Leigh as Alex Danvers is high on my list of favourites, and the bond between the Danvers sisters is the real heart of the show. Leigh and Benoist work well together.Early episodes did show one of the ongoing weaknesses - and one common to the Berlanti verse DC shows and that is bringing in a villain for a episode, only for them to be defeated without leaving much of an impression. There have been a few duds on Supergirl too, and the ongoing season 1 arc with the Fort Ross aliens, Myriad and Astra and Non was only partially successful. (I miss Astra and Laura Benanti!) Already, Brenda Strong as the mysterious Doctor from Project Cadmus is shaping up to be a menacing foe.While there are aliens and bad guys to battle, the tone of Supergirl is generally fun and cheerful. Kara is a delightful character, although the series highlight for me is the season 1 episode 'Fallen' when Kara becomes infected with Red Kryptonite and becomes much LESS of a sweetie! Benoist was fantastic as the mean girl Kara. ","10"
"Supergirl",2016-11-19," I used to like this show because it was just fantasy and the main characters were actually nice, light-hearted, and had good intentions. Not any more. Seriously? Just before the election we get a Trump negative reference, one of the main characters coming out as gay, and then it is promoting aliens establishing themselves in our country? Good grief. Did they run out of actual story lines already or are they just pushing a political agenda down our throats when we were trying to get away from all the political crap? And then there are the stupid office and closet sex scenes... the whole show is going downhill. If I want to see garbage I can watch any primetime station. Can't there be one place to get away from all the junk and just have some old fashioned fun? Television has become mindless. And Supergirl is now a liberal agenda instead of fun and fantasy. ","2"
"Supergirl",2016-11-15," New season is a complete winner. Much improved on the old. More depth in characters, and less 'home and away' style drama. Better story lines, and Supergirl's Buffy style quips are great :)The color palate of the show has also changed in this season. Much better being less pink and perky, more dark, and feeling more like other superhero shows.I hope that the new season continues to improve on the old one as this show settles in to its new network. Seems like this season is going for a different demographic/audience, so I hope the transition picks up more viewers.Bring on the new bad guys! ","10"
"Supergirl",2016-11-08," As a father of young girls, I have a hard time finding TV programming that is empowering, responsible, and entertaining with any shred of morality in it. I was hopeful Supergirl would strike a balance, particularly for young women. Unfortunately, it's ridiculously campy, poorly written, and chocked full of any political agenda you can think of. It isn't good vs evil anymore. It's full of typical Hollywood-centric leftism and characters without any true convictions or compass. The villains are caricatures, the heroes are confused. The level of writing makes one believe the intended audience is 8 to 14 year old girls, but the unnecessary sexuality, language and imagery demonstrates otherwise. It had promise. Sadly, it's just another crappy TV show... ","4"
"Supergirl",2016-11-08," I gave this show a chance but oh my was I disappointed. The acting is so cringy, and the only reason i tried this series out was bc I saw Tyler Hoechlin in this, but he only shows up in like 2 episodes. I have to fastforward every scene with this  supergirl , her pose, the way she speaks and thinks is like a little girl, so cringy. overall I just think they got the wrong leading actress but with this storyline it must have been hard to cast any good ones. Such a waste of time, if this gets renewed but forever and other shows are cancelled then something is wrong in show bizz. Not worth the time, its just a feministic overly emotionel soap opera where they threw in some superhero theme, its just lame. Watch legends of tomorrow, flash or even arrow, but don't watch this unless you wanna feel like you could have acted better yourself ^^ ","1"
"Supergirl",2016-11-01," I had great expectations from this show, i managed to sit through the first season, dragging myself hoping that it would improve in the next episode, but to my dismay, that episode never came.What a waste of the  Super  family legacy, as this show completely annihilates what stood for decades in the comicverse.Sorry to say but the acting by the lead and every other character is pathetic, never can i feel myself bonding with the characters and the way supergirl is portrayed, i doubt she would even be able to withstand a fight with green arrow, let alone other characters with super powers from the dc TV universe.If you want to watch a mockery of Superman and Supergirl, do watch this show, at your own risk of course ","2"
"Supergirl",2016-10-31," What's wrong with this show? everything is. Casting, acting, costumes, story lines the whole works. Can it get worse than this? I don't think so. This is not a super hero show, it is a show about playing house with barbie dolls. The 1966 Batman series of was much better than Supergirl. https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1jgE-lrfZ3kHonestly how can people sit, spend their time & watch this garbage show, it's unbelievable. I personally got tired of watching after like 10 or 20 minutes. The other enigma is the 98% rating on rotten tomatoes. It truly is a rotten rating.Hope Supergirl won't run more than for 2 seasons on TV. The mere sight of it makes me sick. ","1"
"Supergirl",2016-10-29," After reading the horrible, short-sighted reviews on this site, I wanted to give a more balanced review.TL;DR - If you like The Flash, The Arrow (you know, before it started to suck), and/or Legends of Tomorrow, you'll really enjoy this.First off, it's not feminist propaganda by any stretch of the imagination. Yes, women are in a position of power in this show, but so what? It's not preachy, it never once mentions  girl power  or anything of the sort, and even goes out of its way to remind you that Superman is a hero in this universe MORE powerful than Supergirl. Anyone crying on here about SJW's is clearly a little man with self-esteem issues.That said, the first 7-8 episodes of the first season are weak, but it's mainly due to the same issues that plague any show. It takes a bit to find its voice, but once it gets rolling it's a solid villain of the week show with an under-current of season-long plot (a la The Flash or The Arrow). Kara Zor-El is lovable, Martian Manhunter is spectacularly realized (if a bit weaker than he should be), and the ensemble surrounding them is solid.Some suspension of disbelief is required (with several super-powered aliens, some of them Kryptonian, threatening to destroy the world, why doesn't Supergirl ask for Clark's help ever?), but it's never enough to distract from the fun. Now that the show is on the CW, I'm hopeful it'll find the same rhythm as the other Berlantiland shows, but season 1 is still solid and fun.Again, if you like super heroes, you'll enjoy this show. It baffles me how DC's television division can be crushing it this much while their movie universe is a straight abortion. ","8"
"Supergirl",2016-10-29," To be truthful, I am not sure if I love this show, or want to stop watching it.I almost did stop watching, midway through season 1. 1st the positives, it is not dark. I know this is what irritates so many of you, but do all superhero shows, have to be this way. Xena, at times was dark, but never so much so, that you could never feel good while you were watching it. Remember Lex Luthor as portrayed by Gene Hackman, now that's a villain. You hated him, but the tone was not so dark as to be depressing. Secondly, having 4 daughters and 3 granddaughters, anything that portrays, strong women, is fine my me. In fact of the 3 main females, perhaps Cat Grant and Alex, may be the strongest, and help Kara/Supergirl, to grow, as she undertakes this journey. My problems with the show. Love triangles, please stop. Next, Jimmy Olsen should have been played by Jeremy Jordan, and Winn Schott by Mehcad Brooks. Whet happened to Jimmy being a nerd? Also please stop preaching to us. Kryptonians worrying about us destroying our planet, enough already. Hopefully the writing will improve, and the story lines will not be as lame. As to the acting, which many of you hate. When my daughters were young, I was forced to watch a show with them, called Small Wonder, ever since then, everything I have seen seems Oscar worthy.So I cannot really comment on the acting. ","7"
"Supergirl",2016-10-25," Building on the theme of super powered aliens that look like people, Supergirl uses quite predictable story lines to be not too overwhelming but still interesting. Supergirl is ever cute, bubbly and ready for action. She always saves the day, usually with her friends. With super but never completely invincible powers, Kara does everything a good super girl should do. But one thing to notice is how Supergirl always has wind in her hair at the right time, even inside. She is perfect. Great outfits, killer style and never a shoe out of place. This is easy watching at its easiest. Kid friendly. That's what makes it boring and too squeaky clean. Fluffy fun for sure. ","6"
"Supergirl",2016-10-17," I'm a very open minded person, and when I started watching this show I didn't have exceedingly high expectations and after the first few episodes I realized why...The show is very very feministic, like WAY over the top. The writers and directors didn't stick with the original storyline and in place of being an awesome show they made it more 'diverse' which IMO ruined it. Kara's boss is a smug New York City brat and who thinks she's genetically gifted and better than everyone else when in reality she is just as ugly outside as she is inside. Kara, the nerdy office assistant who is super girl is sooo needy of everyone's help and approval. Like really? You have super powers and you act like that?! They never have appearances of superman himself just dialogue of him having been at certain scenes or mentions of him. Overall the show is way too tacky, the acting is overthetop dramatic and emotions are forced. You can totally tell that the show is driven by feminist propaganda and it really kills the vibe of the comic series. It's a shame that in our day and age we have to have liberalism shoved down our throats. This show is so bad that I probably won't watch it after the first season. It's just too unrealistic and fake. And not just the acting. OK I take it back, I hate her boss in this show. ","3"
"Supergirl",2016-10-14," Supermen's cousin has her own show now and show is dumb, but it's OK for lazy afternoons when you just wanna relax and watch something with half of brain. From the first episode it irresistibly reminds of Flash, literally same story with different actors, and then they even cross them and Flash appears near the end of season. Objectively, it is lousy show, but I loved Beverly Hills in 90's so this one fits me too.* * * *After second season I have to improve rating from 6 to 7. It's still more naive and childish than other superhero shows, but it's constantly improving and becomes more fun. If we ignore lame musical crossover with Flash, which technically belongs to Flash series anyway, second season has no weak episodes. If you are fan of dark and serious superheroes, like Nolan's Batman, this will look silly to you, even stupid, but if you like classic approach to superheroes like they originally were, Supergirl will not disappoint you.7/10 ","7"
"Supergirl",2016-10-10," Really bad choice of superman no potential at all like super girl also don't have. I am so angry that they mentioned about the real justice league time line. How can you compare this superman with the real deal of justice league one. If I had a chance to finish this series I would instantly do it as there is nothing but a wasting of time. Flash and arrow was 100x better now. Sorry but superhero like superman should stay in movies and never comes to small screen. There are so many faults in this series including effects, poor acting, bad camera directions, including the wrong role to wrong people. I mean come on do they even took the auditions of people who plays their role in this series? overall I am really unsatisfied and this TV shows is really really bad now. ","1"
"Supergirl",2016-10-04," I won't say it's terrible. It's one of those shows that you would watch when the channel you were watching was playing this. But you don't care if you missed one or several episodes, and you won't change to CW on purpose just to watch this. The cast is OK. The idea of black Jimmy Olsen makes me feel sad about how twisting 'political correct' has become. We have to change the race of characters just to smooth their feelings... The biggest flaw in this show is Melissa Benoist's performance. When I watched this show, I didn't see Kara, just a girl version of Clark Kent. I can accept different ideas, but this 'awkward vs awesome' is not even original. Nice outfit though. ","5"
"Supergirl",2016-09-26," The show is full of obnoxious characters that are a perfect storm of idiotic and condescending, who get tons of air time speaking their mind. Lots of shows do this to varying degrees, but they really step it up a notch with this one. Supergirl's boss is one example. If I wanted to watch annoying dimwitted people bitching like temperamental children, I would watch reality TV.I really do want to like this show. And honestly I've only watched a few episodes. so I am hoping it improves. We shall see.Also.. there is a whole lot of feminism in this show, which in and of itself is fine. But the way they go about it is mostly immature. Hopefully this improves as well. Right now, the way they go about it just makes you feel embarrassed for the characters. And really makes you wonder what kind of people are writing the script for this show. ","4"
"Supergirl",2016-09-10," Look, I hated this from the get go for a variety of different reasons, and that was just from the commercials. I decided to watch an episode because I wanted to see if maybe I was being too harsh. I was not. This show is terrible, from the cringe worthy acting, to the terrible characterization. Supergirl isn't super. All she does is complain about not being able to get a man. I watched the episode with the Flash and in the end Supergirl has to be saved by the firemen. She complains the whole episode about how the city has lost faith in her, and in the end she can't beat even one of the villains, the civilians have to do all the heroics for her, and yet they still somehow find it in their hearts to forgive her. For a feminist show they're doing a terrible job. The other thing I can't get over is the complete and total rewrite of Jimmy Olsen's character. Look, I get that casting black actors in white roles is something that happens now, but that isn't even my main complaint about Jimmy. They renamed him James Olsen, and turned him from a dorky shy camera boy, to a suave, debonair ladies man with (supposedly) heaps of sex appeal. This is not Jimmy Olsen. If they wanted a character like that, they should have just created a new one. Overall, I'd give Supergirl a 0/5 if I could. ","1"
"Supergirl",2016-09-10," Some people think it's good. Some hate it. Some don't have much of an opinion. But I'm a huge fan. In fact, this is my favourite show of all time. How can a show like this top up shows like Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, Daredevil and the likes? How can it even top up the new and amazingly directed show  The Night of  by HBO? These nitty gritty shows with lots of dark themes and holy sht that's dark and I really like it moments?It's simple. Because - my fellow people who also love this show but seem outspoken - this show is the complete opposite. In the words of a critic on Rotten tomatoes: I need a show in my life that's about hope. Supergirl provides just enough sugar in an otherwise bleak diet. People used to dark and grim, need not bother, it's not for you. The rest of us will enjoy it for the pure, blissful fun that it is. And I would've put that as my review if not for the IMDb line requirements. Just being straight and honest, I love Supergirl because it's the only show that really puts hope in my heart for a better tomorrow. It always puts a smile on my face and teaches me lessons to make me a better person. Life is too full of the cynical and while some cynicism keeps us grounded, I think we need much much more light in our TV viewings. Supergirl is what i think of when I have a bad day or when I just need someone to tell me it's all going to be alright. If I have a bad day, looking at GOT and seeing someone have a worse day doesn't make me feel better. It just makes me feel even more depressed. I think the critics can see that. This show got a 96% on Rotten for a reason. Not even some of the greatest shows get that on their first season. Believe me, this show knows what it's doing, and it does it not to perfection, rather, to a great effect. If you want to really criticise Supergirl. Talk about its non perfect special effects (I mean, it doesn't really have the enormous budget that shows like Daredevil had), or its sometimes infidelity to its source material. Because these things are things that comic book fans don't like and understandably so. But ask yourself if today's society is just getting so used to being spiteful, hopeless, and cynical about everything and anything (complaining about the world, talking about changing it but then giving up because they say there's nothing that can be done, or otherwise something would've been done etc. etc.). In the end, I'm a truly big fan of Supergirl. I love it. I love it more than the Flash, Arrow, Daredevil and all other shows I've ever watched including Lost. And if you love it too, but feel outspoken, well...You are not alone. ","10"
"Supergirl",2016-09-04," first of all MELISSA BENOIST is a fantastic actress and so charming she kills it in every scene everyone who watched the show would agree on this point but the writing sucks the producers sucks too GREG BERLANTI is a BAD producer why does he even have a job he was behind green lantern and pan the biggest flops like ever also the supporting cast were meh they didn't add anything except CALISTA she was good the CGI and sfx sucked are they writing/producing the show for 12 years old or what i rated this 7/10 just because i liked MELISSA's performance so much if you want to watch the show just fast forward the scenes she's not in the best scene of season 1 was in 1x06 the heat vision scene and the best episode was 1X16 all because of Melissa the producers strike gold with her that's for sure .I really feel bad for her she's stuck with this garbage she deserve better projects maybe Broadway after ithopefully gets canceled CALISTA knows best she jumped this ship LOL. CW is a teen drama network and it will definitely kill the show just look at the superman casting are you kidding me it's like they wan't the show to get canceled they aren't even trying instead of casting a good well known actor in his mid 40 they went with this MTV guy who don't even look the part .CBS YOU MESSED UP you could have fired the writers hired better producers killed off half of the supporting cast how i don't care about then this show would have still AVERAGED 13 MILLIONS A WEEK OR EVEN TRY SELLING IT TO A BTTER NETWORK NOT CW LIKE HBO ESPECIALLY THAT TIME WARNER OWN BOTH HBO AND WB SHAME A VERY PROMISING SHOW THAT NO ONE CARED ENOUGH TO SEE IT SUCCEED EXCEPT HIS LEADING ACTRESS .

"Supergirl",2016-08-31," I really like Arrow (as it is essentially just a Batman show using Arrow), but it often seems to waste a lot of time and spin it's wheels with it's long seasons... Flash was even better, because it came into Arrows world, and ran with it, like DC/Marvel TV shows and movies ALWAYS should have!Supergirl has taken this to the next level! Not only is she in 'their' world, FINALLY Superman is in HERS!!! Even though I am only about 8 episodes in, the subtle way Superman is in this show is what DC/Marvel always should have done. If you don't use the characters (or can't) then still talk about them, that is the world your character lives in! I have no problem with 'black Jimmy', I hate these characters like traditional him, and 'Aunt May' that seemed trapped in amber, he is both likable and the coolest version of 'Supermans best pal'.I loved the Martian Manhunter reveal, and Red Tornado, they have really started out with all the ducks in a row, character and story wise. The formula is almost exactly like Smallville, Arrow and Flash with the hero and its supporting cast, regular villain, sidekick, unrequited love. It's working, so no reason to change it I guess.Supergirl is both adorable and completely awesome, her casting is perfection, costume looks fantastic and super-sexy, if Melissa Benoist wasn't so strong and perfect, Calista Flockhart would not work in this role because she is such a strong and show stealing actor.I've always been a bigger Marvel fan, but after Smallville, Arrow, Flash and now this, DC is my TV universe of choice. This is probably the most likable and enjoyable show with constant payoffs for fanboys and the layman viewer alike.I can't wait to get home and keep watching this show! ","8"
"Supergirl",2016-08-26," yea i may be a guy but this show i am not ashamed to admit i love and if i can help it never miss this is much more than girl power and cupcake style fluff here its action packed full of fast paced fun for any age who can handle a little violence its not only girl power but also nerd power we geeks have been waiting for a girl like this shes sweet beautiful and headstrong shes truly the hero for kids today young and old alike i love this and hope to see it around for many more seasons yes i have a crush on kara but who wouldn't once u see that sweet little smile ya gotta love super girl hands down one of the best heros to hit TV in a long time ","9"
"Supergirl",2016-08-18," The acting is terrible, the special effects are terrible, and the writing is terrible. I laugh through the whole thing because it's so bad. It appears as if the show has a fifty dollar budget per season. I don't think the writers have actually heard people have conversations, as the dialogue is extremely flat and the conversations do not flow like real conversations. I'd feel bad for the actors if they were any good. Also, Supergirl's powers do not seem well defined. Sometimes she seems as powerful as she should be (compared to the comics) and other times not at all. It's very confusing. Lastly, costuming is very unrealistic. All of the characters look like they just purchased their clothing that morning from the Gap. None of the clothes look lived in. A minor pet peeve, but I felt I should include it. ","2"
"Supergirl",2016-08-17," I can't believe how many of these reviews are being written by people who sound a lot like me..old comic fans hoping for something better. Waited a long time and it's finally here..what a disappointment.not only supergirl but the  gene  as a whole..for too long I've watched shows that claimed to be about people with super powers and how they learn to use those powers for good and justice and so on and what do I get, shows about  kids  who have to fit in..who don't worry about saving lives but rather if they can play football and score with Lana. For twenty years all I've seen is shows from Warner's/DC which just scream  BE NORMAL  that super powers are wrong! Who in their right mind would chose to give up superman's powers to be normal...maybe Batman.. he's sightly demented (hear he takes little kids into violent crime zones)but hey I know it's all a  fantasy  but give me a break are you trying to tell me that all the stories dealing with  gods  in the past, now and future show Zeus sitting on his throne just praying, begging to be normal!! Why do I keep referring to  the big guy  when doing a review of Supergirl...well guess what guys..she's the best gosh darn superman ever (only the animated shows are better) ...guess they were right girls do have to work twice as hard. Kara tells us each week how she has always wanted to use her GREAT powers for GOOD and I believe her..she is the best I've ever seen at it..but there is ONE SMALL PROBLEM she also BRAGS that when she arrived on Earth once she discovered that we had Superman we had enough superheros (ONE!!!) so she would use her amazing powers TO BE THE greatest secretary in the world (must be millions of them..but I can assure you, Kara is the fastest at shorthand) IN FACT, for the past twelve years she has practiced and refined her use of her superhearing to the point where can she tune out the screams for help, all the police sirens, all the fire alarms AND be able only know when her boss is about to arrive and have her coffee ready..WHAT A HERO!???..you know how hard this was to stomach and still watch this...had to, got a crush on SUPERGIRL, it has got to get better..meet the cast now.not very big..strange tho..this is the daily planet..wait no that can't be right..no met Perry White..no he's a woman?? Wait a minute I've seen this show..wasn't it the Adventures Of Superman..just don't remember all the women...must be all the drugs..no it's just that this show ain't original at all..kind of feels rushed..like kind of faster then a speeding bullet rushed..give them credit almost a perfect copy of the Daily Planet and it's crew...only noticed one mistake..there seems to be two Jimmy Olson s (maybe he's Lois Lane huh),nah the writings so clever that you know this poor guy is DOOMED DOOMED DOOMED he's one them there red shirts on Star Trek..he ain't going make it to the end of this pilot,,,ah, wait he did in fact live to go on to become Lois Lane...I think..nah he's doomed just not yet...but you just wait that first kiss is going to be a killer...well you just hold on to your draws boys this is the best. For the next four or five weeks this  girl  proves herself time and again. She is perfect in so many ways..within no time she proves she's A WOMAN a serious and unbelievable fantastic person (who very shortly should finally receive her long awaited godhood medal after all these years) TEN WEEKS..this is one great superhero show..well it was..you see Kara/Supergirl/Superman gets it wrong and she was doing so well..she forgot that she was suppose to save Lois Lane not kill him..oh and how she does it..this fantastic woman turns into  teenage Kid  and rips his heart out and craps on it not once, but as far as I can tell twenty or thirty more times...I really liked how about three days later after  burying  Lois..she announces she's going out on her first real date,what caring what kindness...BULL Kara would never have done this and Supergirl would never have allowed it to have happened,,what is even cooler..everyone one on the show every character knew about his love and knew where it was headed and they all stood by and let it happen...the kid has some real friends. This show was doing so well as a superhero show..now it's just another teenage soap opera, showing kids destroying each others lives in they quest to be normal,,,SORRY SUPERGIRL..I wish you luck, but I can't set here any more and watch you destroy all those around you. You know I hear that later in the season you will feel the effects. of red krytonite,what are you going to do, kill your best friend, for real this time..oh and slowly..rip his heart out and laugh..no I bet you'll kiss him and say you're sorry as his lifeless body slides to the floor,,wait that's evil and only Kara knows about love and how to handle it..she's the one that has to kill him,,his best friend..his love.his goddess. I'm not very good at soaps..neither is Kara...WHY COULDN'T YOU LET SUPERGIRL LIVE..why did you kill this boy..in doing so you killed Kara..Supergirl and me..well as I shut off the program for the last time I offer this advice to Kara:quit your day jobstop trying to be a girl, be a WOMAN for once. NO,be the SUPERWOMAN you should have always been...but it's only a fantasy..a TV show who cares...maybe us old timers, who thought of our heroes..our SUPER HEROES were worth believing in..oh well there are plenty of other shows to watch, I hear there's a great western show on in the afternoon..believe it's called General Hospital..oh wait maybe, it's another superhero show.

"Supergirl",2016-08-03," I think 6/10 is a fair score for something I don't look out for, but record and watch when I'm on my spin bike. I can watch leisurely but it won't matter if I miss a bit of dialogue here and there during my sprints.It's goofy and lame but visually appealing - Supergirl is off the chart fitness and I'd watch it just to see her in that outfit every week. As with most mainstream shows of this nature, all the people are thin trim and good looking and you won't see a fat person for miles.Most of the characters are way overdone, and none, even Supergirl are true to the either original or established character framework. In fact both Supergirl's abilities and character have been warped so badly I'm not even sure anyone identifies with her... but for the name and big red 'S' on her rather fetching top. Jimmy Olsen will probably grate against the nerves of viewers since he's been totally re-written, (and I'm not simply referring to colour). The scrawny red haired kid that needed a watch to call superman when he was in trouble has gone. There would be less contrast if you' swapped Pee wee Herman for Arnold Swartzenegger. The acting is actually quite good and I'm surprised at the level of competence achieved given the script they're often given to work with. David Harewood is particularly good as its Calista Flockhart - though her character is somewhat overdone, but the whole cast is surprisingly able.The special effects aren't exactly blockbuster worthy and probably won't stand the scrutiny of hard-core comic book or sci-fi fans, but are certainly better than the stuff you see on the Sci-Fi channel films, and good enough for the average TV audience.There are too many villains and aside from Peter Facinelli (more of a mild protagonist that a villain) who plays Maxwell Lord not enough 'badguy' development. Most of the successful Sci-fi series have learnt the sub-plot development of the baddie with reappearances at stages in the series works well if not over-extended. This show seems to have badguy's 'on tap' and I'm amazed Supergirl has time to don that particularly enticing outfit (seriously she's hot) let alone lust after Jimmy Olsen (doesn't work for me really, but I give it some leeway).I don't really get the feminist angle some people irk about. It just seems normal every day stuff to me, slightly exaggerated for the screen of course but nothing to moan about. However that's not to say their aren't some background agendas at work here. As a male chauvinist I quite like the strength of the female characters. They certainly are not shoving feminist propaganda at you as some have mentioned, but lets be fair here; Supergirl is not one of the strong female characters. She's winey and weak and sell absorbed. She constantly relies on the strength of others to get herself on track, has very little self esteem and panders shallow questionable aspirations. Suffice it to say she has very few redeeming character traits. Here's the kicker, she pretty so it OK. I like it. Its 'BubbleGum' entertainment at best, but it is getting a bit better as the series goes on. ","6"
"Supergirl",2016-06-21," Believe me... I wanted to like this series... I wanted a good Supergirl. I've even watched the entire first season so I can say in response to all those  hang in there, it gets better  reviews... For what? There is nothing coming that will make the show anything more then a sad rip off of better super man series. First off I'll get it out of the way right away, the writers are awful and this is best demonstrated by their constant misuse of Superman... It is clearly obvious that WB put limits on what they could do with him... and to be frank he'd be better absent then what they have done with him. Some of the stupidest writing is directly related to him. In the episode following up how she says she needs to learn to accept help from friends, they right him in saving her from certain death from a villain... her response?  I can't have superman saving me every-time I'm in trouble .. fine next time just die that's what was gonna happen. In the scene it happened we only get to see a blurred image of him as he saves her, then later him on their fake im service apologizing as Clark... The sad part was as bad as this scene was... this was his better cameo... as the next time was outright horrid writing, I'd say I'd expect better from a 12 year old fan writing fan-fiction then this episode delivered... Superman's in space doing something... stop right there... no further writing needed I could forgive this, but no they had to bring him back and get controlled by a mind control device for humans which effected him because he was on earth so long because that has ever been used in a story before... I could forgive it if I mean at this point he's here on earth controlled by the bad guys so a confrontation between superman and supergirl... but no they can't do that because they are so limited in what they can show of him, so instead she fights her earth sister who is wearing a super suit of some type and attacking her with a kryptonite katana. But another problem is the villains, a lot of them are lesser versions of other superman villains or female ones. Powergirl and Bizzaro were mixed into one, Indigo (feels rewritten to be Brainiac in this), red tornado (as a bad guy?!), Livewire, Banshee (My gosh laziness on the writing side for flash, Barry ends up fighting 2 different sonic screamers from different dimensions in one season!, not to mention multiple speedsters in 2 seasons) to name a few. Non and Astra are 2  original  characters, and by original rip-offs of General Zod and Ursa (making them a couple doesn't make them any less a rip off). Fort Rozz is a rip off of phantom zone, no getting around that. Max Lords, who makes me laugh the most, his actor going on to comment how he is different from Lex Luthor. He is a billionaire scientist who has it out for an alien wearing an S and Cape and has some casual interest in a female relevant in their lives, I mean that's completely different from Lex (I mean look at that head of hair).This one might sound nit-picky and racist... but seriously its not about that, Samuel L Jackson is a great Nick Furry, Michael Clark Duncan as Kingpin was about the only good thing about daredevil the movie, but I have to say it, Mechad Brooks is the worst possible choice ever for Jimmy Olsen. Why? For one thing, he isn't nerdy at all, he's bald, he's too attractive for the character... I didn't even know he was Jimmy Olson til the 3rd episode I thought Winslow Scott Jr. was Jimmy as he looks the part of Jimmy Olson. It's one thing to rewrite an important character to the series, but this actually irritates me as it suggests DC no longer respects Jimmy as a character and think of him as a throw away character... you want to make him black... that's fine... but you have to have someone who fits Jimmy and not so you can create some weird love triangle involving Supergirl.But before I end I will give it credit where it is due... The Hank Henshaw turning out to be Martian Manhunter was an enjoyable twist. Cat Grant role initially annoyed me with them making her an important feminist stereotype, but she at least was a consistent character (more then can be said for Kara or Kara's sister). I now find that since the series is moving she isn't even going to be a recurring character. I was really hoping there would be more out of Dean Cain too, instead he's barely been in it.Ultimately I don't get any of it's praise it's got, its writing is rarely decent more often coming off as bad fan fiction. The fact that it now part of the Arrowverse continuum is saddest part of all this as it means she is relevant to Flash. It's really sad CW thought this was more valuable to save then Constantine.

"Supergirl",2016-06-18," Is it really too much to ask for some originality...OK fine...Super-Girl's story isn't much different from The Man of Steel's...But that's not the problem I have with this show...How many times are we gonna see the same old high school mentality story lines..?? Guy #1 has a crush on girl #1, but not only is he stuck in the friend zone with her, she has a crush on guy #2...So sooner or later, guy #1 is gonna walk in on guy #2 kissing girl #1 which of course will break his heart...But the writers aren't gonna shock us (don't make me laugh) with that scenario just yet...So how do they stretch things out so it can last a full season..??Oh here's an idea...Let's bring in girl #2 who just happens to be in a complicated relationship with guy #2, which of course makes girl #1 all dough eyed and jealous...A love square instead of a love triangle...Sadly that's the best angle that the writers could come up with for this show...And what's even worse is that the creators of this show really think they've accomplished something by switching networks...As far as I'm concerned...It doesn't really matter that this show has moved from CBS to the CW...Because that tends to happen with TV shows that put out crap written by people who can't or won't graduate high school...And that's all there is too it...

"Supergirl",2016-06-18," Another female-driven TV show? YES, PLEASE! It's great when these types of shows come on, you see conventions and stereotypes twisted and it changes your perspectives on things. 'Supergirl' does just that and gives women the ability to see that they can channel their own Supergirl in their own way and use it in their every day lives. Kara Zor-El (Melissa Benoist) is sent to Earth from Krypton to protect her cousin Kal-El. On her way, Kara's spacecraft was hit by Krypton's explosion and sends it to the Phantom Zone. But when she finally lands on Earth she's saved by her cousin, who has now become Superman, and takes her to the Danvers family. Now 24 years old, Kara learns to embrace her powers and becomes Supergirl.I think every girl out there can relate to Kara. I know I can. Melissa's portrayal as Kara is brilliant; funny, a little socially-awkward and very sweet. I see her has the female equivalent of Barry from 'The Flash'). They could be best friends. She even has a crush on James Olsen (Mehcad Brooks), who she's afraid to reveal her feelings to. I feel like we don't get to see these types of girls on television anymore. There's definitely a pressure for girls to look a certain way nowadays and Kara brings back the ideology that girls don't have to succumb to that pressure. Embrace your awkwardness and be yourself. Now, as Supergirl, Kara is strong and determined. Flying into danger, without any regard of her own life. Her only thought is to save the people of National City. I have to admit, I am a bit jealous of how she is able to balance her double life. Only one season in, I can see that this show will continue to be great. I personally think that that there needs to be more shows like this. That shows the real depiction of how girls can be. It sends a strong message to every girl out there to stay true to themselves and have the courage to not conform to society. ","10"
"Supergirl",2016-06-14," In the first episode, Supergirl attempts to fly after not having done so in years. She's up, she's down, she's up, she's down, <U+0085> And that's the way the first season went except whereas in Episode 1 Supergirl finally soars, the freshman show never quite gets airborne. Supergirl has a strong cast and an exceptional hero yet its ratings weren't high enough for CBS to renew it (it was sent to the CW network). So what went wrong?What worked: Melissa Benoist <U+0096> With the show build around her, casting Supergirl correctly was critical. Fortunately, Ms. Benoist isn't just good, or even great. She is, in a word, <U+0096> tell me you didn't see this one coming <U+0096>  Super . As Supergirl, she was completely convincing from her beginnings as an eager, earnest, but inexperienced heroine to the season concluding mature, composed, and confident champion. As Kara, she's a bit klutzy but I guess one has to try something to pretend folks won't realize you're Supergirl's doppleganger. Regardless, she owns the role and hits a home run way, way out of the park.Relationships <U+0096> If Ms. Benoist was the heart of the show, relationships were its soul. With its perhaps too large cast, there were more relationships than time to fully develop them but the big three were SG <U+0096> Alex, SG <U+0096> Manhunter <U+0096> Alex, and SG/Kara <U+0096> Cat Grant. In these, the parties grew and changed for the better. The issues were significant such as the baggage Alex carried from growing up with a demigod or Supergirl coping with a trusted friend (ultimately learning it was Alex) killing one of her two remaining blood relatives or Kara mentoring Cat on family and being mentored on hope. All in all, really good stuff.The show's tone <U+0096> This isn't Zack Snyder's universe of dark, morose characters. In fact, the closest parallel to Supergirl might be Officer Hopps in Zootopia. Both are driven to protect and help, they refuse to give in to overwhelming odds or give up after failure, and both are perpetually optimistic or at least don't stay depressed for very long. But this isn't bad. Most of the recurring characters in Supergirl could be role models and while I feel it's certainly a female-centric show, I don't see that it's misandristic. Except for Maxwell Lord (always the sharpest though most bent blade in the drawer), the featured males equal the women as role models. What doesn't workJames Olsen <U+0096> In the comics Jimmy, as he is called, is an impetuous, freckled redhead. Mehcad Brooks definitely isn't but it's not his lack of freckles or red hair that's the issue. Rather, it's the same Olsen issue that exists in the comics, that of getting face time with the hero. The comics dealt with this by having Olsen getting into trouble (remember  impetuous ?) and Superman saving him. That clearly isn't going to work on this show. Mr. Brooks is second billed yet is the least defined of the major characters because of his lack of quality screen time. In a superhero action/adventure show, the playground of the hero isn't a place for normal mortals. The DEO field agents are supposed to be highly trained operatives but if their name isn't Alex, they might as well suit up in Star Trek red uniforms. So if not in the field, how does Olsen interact with Supergirl? The writer's appear to be taking the romance tack for more face time but comic writers tried this with Lois Lane for 73 years before finally killing the idea of a Lois <U+0096> Clark/Superman romance in 2011 because of the problems integrating her into his action/adventure universe. The producers should never have introduced Olsen into the show. Mr. Brooks would have been much better served being cast as Maxwell Lord, National City's morally challenged answer to Tony Stark, who could find ways to participate in fights or disasters without being completely out of place and is intrinsically more interesting than Olsen. As it is, Olsen is a millstone weighing down the show.The writing <U+0096> Even Ms. Benoist can't carry a show where the writing doesn't provide some foundation for her to stand on. In what was the most fun episode of the season, the Flash crossover, a second rate villain takes out both Supergirl and the Flash but is then defeated by firemen with a hose. Huh? Or in the continuity department, Supergirl flies into space to say prayers over her Aunt's casket yet in the season finale, going into space is a one way ticket to death since as Alex says, she can't breath, can't fly, can't return from there. Or after building up the Supergirl-Cat relationship, coming back from Christmas break and having Cat go off the rails and out of character by firing Kara for not confessing she is Supergirl. For all these little things, the larger issue was there was no compelling Season 1 story line. Fort Roz appeared intended for this purpose but half the episodes had nothing to do with this line and didn't advance it in any way. And Fort Roz was fatally flawed from the start, at least in terms of logic. Since Roz came to earth with her, why did the criminals wait until she was an adult to make their move? They outnumbered her tremendously but never just tried to overwhelm her? Pretty bumbling criminals. In summary, Season 1 was OK but not more. The ingredients for a great show are there but the writers need to up their game, come up with more compelling antagonists, develop more than just a  villain of the week  approach, and provide more for Olsen to do than just stand around and respond to Cat's  I want a picture  with,  I'm on it  or be in a doomed romance. But with Ms. Benoist in the lead, there's hope for Season 2. ","7"
"Supergirl",2016-06-11," I think first 3 episodes damaged its reputation way too much that everything after that was seen negative way .Yeah it can be a little bit women dominated(won't call feminist) show but that is understandable as main cast is a woman & its about her own life also. Also they tried to bring Devil Wear Prada type scenario for Supergirl which is enjoyable if you are not seeking for any personal agenda.If head of Catco Ms Cat Grant is portrayed as feminist then it also had an evil touch with that .So relax men shouldn't be jumping over that negatively(Yes i m a Man) .It showed how single women who can't be with men actually hate men & give different reasons .so not really a feminist agenda but actually showing whats wrong with that view .Atleast our Supergirl don't believe those craps & that should be a relief for Men watching this show.In first 3 episode the Tech friend of supergirl was acting so weirdly that i thought he was not interested in woman , thats how bad first 3 episode was. Characters were acting poorly & giving wrong idea about their own identity ,later after episode 3 every one from supergirl to other cast member's acting got more real & less like  The Devils Wear Prada  .I compared it with Arrow & Flash .Well i actually enjoyed it more than Arrow Season 3 & 4 &. this show kinda have similarity with Flash though when it comes to relationship issue it handle better those parts than Flash.Flash sometime over-complicates simple relationship which i don't like . .I don't hate the Character Jimmy Wilson .I kinda like Him .He has a charm as an Actor & i liked him more than Smallville Jimmy Wilson .Though i didn't like Irish chemistry In Flash.I think this show has some smallville touch as fight scenes are not that complex but its more about character's personal struggle .Though i think they should have done fight scene better but i do enjoy the show even when characters are not in any battle mode .These little thinks are Which i miss in Arrow ,Arrow just all about fight enemy ,constant darkness no other relaxing storyline .Supergirl succeed well in that part .Enemy is always there but its the working life in catco or family story which is also important part of the show .Supergirl ballance both work & crime scenario nice way. even in the mid of darkness it give audience a chance to enjoy events at Catco where the head of Catco Ms Cat Grant is really enjoyable & charming character to watch .I would give supergirl 7.5 ","7"
"Supergirl",2016-06-07," I really wanted to like this show but it is just so boring; especially the relationship between Kara and Jimmy. They don't make a good couple at all and this show is wasting airtime with that mess. Not every show need romance or drama, what a show needs is a good storyline. I really hope this move from CBS to CW (due to a lower budget requirement in CW) will make this show better. I heard CBS have a higher budget requirement, thus producing a lower quality show. Perhaps, the actions from the flash affected this show as well because it definitely need a re-do. The four shows crossing over that might be awesome and just what this show need. Make it exist in the same multi-universe. The last thing this show needs is better Superman. The quality of Superman needs to be improved, just stop making him weak. ","4"

"Supergirl",2016-06-06," ****** some possible Spoilers ******* The first thing wrong with Supergirl is there is no personality difference between Kara and Supergirl. Regardless of the role she acts the same way. Sometimes it's like watching Glee with a cape. Next issue is there is an army of Kryptonions in town and no sign of Superman to help resolve the situation, but you have acknowledge his presence. So for him not to show up is ridiculous. The Krypton army should have never been written in the show in the first place. I could have understand one here or there through out the season. I truly don't understand why the writing is so bad when you have the whole history of Supergirl already done in the comics. Is it really that hard to update the story that has already been told? I hope future seasons will start to show better writing. ","4"
"Supergirl",2016-05-27," The low score for this series is rather sad. DC finally gets it right, but of course, everybody wants something else... who knows what. Ignore the cynics: Supergirl excels on every count: casting, mood, visuals, character and even plot (typically DC's Achilles heel). As a bonus, it superbly captures that old-time DC feeling - without becoming either syrupy or campy.Some may argue that the series is too soft, too childish. That's absurd. There are lots of harsh events in this show - a number of brutal and very significant deaths, for a start. What critics are shying away from isn't childishness, it's *innocence*. Something that's out of fashion, much to the detriment of our entire culture.But that's exactly the theme here: innocence vs cynicism. Simplicity vs complexity. And, yes, good vs evil. We see the original 1959 Supergirl, facing ills that are essentially modern. She wants to fight evil without becoming part of an evil world, without losing the essential innocence that gives her her strength. That's a really powerful idea. It's what the best of us are trying to do every day: overcome the horrible problems facing our world, without becoming cynical, defeatist, negative (or *old*).It's what makes a hero: resisting evil not with a gun, or with your fists, but denying it with your very nature.Melissa Benoist is perfectly cast, as a very human young woman, unsure of her abilities, her social standing, her emotions - and yet both deeply caring and fundamentally tough. She out-shines every screen version of Superman by light years, because she actually has a strong personality - one that's depicted vividly, and which sits squarely at the core of all the stories.In a way, it might be fair to say that Supergirl is the 'chick-flick' of DC superhero shows. In the sense that it deals with emotion seriously, frankly, realistically. It never cops out with the make-believe angst of a show like Arrow. Instead, it shows us *genuine* affection between Kara and her sister, *genuine* friendship between Supergirl and Hank Henshaw. It shows us strong, painfully real emotions as they are sorely tested - but never bent or trivialized just for the convenience of a bonehead plot.Supergirl is far and away the best TV series DC has done so far (other than Gotham, of course, which isn't really a 'superhero' show), the one DC series that really has some dramatic meat on its bones. It's exactly because Supergirl succeeds as drama that it's able to present us with a super-heroine who's worthy of the name.I enjoy the other DC shows, but Supergirl is the only one that has me counting the days between episodes.UPDATE: As we near the end of Season Two, my admiration for this series is unshaken. The characters continue to ring true. The romantic relationships, which could easily be horribly over-done, instead feel plausible and remarkably genuine. And the action side remains resolutely true to the best 1950s DC traditions - a bit silly, a bit wacky, yet with a consistent logic that dodges the kind of incessant let-downs we've seen in Arrow and Flash.One example: a recent episode dealt with the idea of Supergirl being blackmailed by threats to one of her human friends. Flash has faced this situation multiple times, and has cravenly capitulated each time (usually giving up his super-powers, just to underscore what an idiot he is). Supergirl is told firmly that she *can't* negotiate with terrorists - and she doesn't. Instead, she finds an intelligent solution to the problem, that doesn't depend on mere super-muscle.Lesson: even silly super-heroics benefit from clever writing. Which Supergirl has in abundance, and the other DC shows (save Gotham) emphatically do not. ","9"
"Supergirl",2016-05-27," I really liked the Supergirl movie back in the 80s. I was still a little girl and even though most people found it mediocre, I thought Helen Slater was so great as Supergirl. Now in the 21st century, I was really overjoyed that it became a TV series. I was so excited about it at first, thinking Melissa Benoist is so cute and pretty as Supergirl. Eventually it became a monotonous experience for me watching the episodes. The characters are too predictable and they are like copycats from other movies. The super villains are interesting to me but not enough to keep the plot exciting. What's great about the show is the awesome soundtrack. Overall, it's just like a tribute to the Supergirl movie, having Helen Slater as Supergirl's adoptive mother. If there will be a Season 2, I'd still watch it, though I'm looking forward to better acting and story line. ","6"
"Supergirl",2016-05-13," I love this show, but i think its stuck on the alien invasion for way to long, my opinion i think you need to add more people into the group of people that work with super-girl i get the military and undercover people but i mean in her friendship group, it would also be cool if you added a any lgbt character, but i hope in season 2 maybe add more action like heaps, and i guess more romance maybe get super-girl to find someone else she can be interested in, James is cool and all but i totally want her to like be all weird and flirty or show-offish when around a new character she likes as in has a crush, idk, and also i loved the episode where she was evil maybe make her have like a mean side just not one that makes her say things she thinks that are mean but make her tougher :D just meh opinion or suggestions or something like that... she totally needs a new ability something different from superman..

"Supergirl",2016-05-09," Can't remember any other show lately that made me feel giddy and like I was a kid playing superhero again. Although I also like (more like LOVE) the dark vibe that's going on with Arrow, JJ and Daredevil, it's good to lighten up and remember the positive aspects of life, friendship and superpowers. Also, Melissa Benoist is just so darn cute! I want her to be my new BFF/sister! She even had me loving Cat Grant and wanting her as my boss/role model. Don't just throw it away because it looks  silly  at first, give it a chance to help you release your inner child. If you had a childhood anything like mine, you'll also be terribly nostalgic. Please give it good ratings so it doesn't get canceled! ","10"
"Supergirl",2016-04-23," Personally I think people on here are being to harsh on CW's Supergirl. Overall, I think it is a great show.At first I wasn't that impressed with it but as the show has gone on i have been getting more and more gripped. The acting is good, the storyline is getting more developed and as the series goes on we are getting to know the characters better and on a more personally scale.The one criticism I do have though is that the fighting scenes they do have aren't that great and seem too acted. As well, they could have better villains that last longer than a few episodes.Overall, Supergirl has some great potential despite the weak start. It is a great show and i can't wait for more. ","8"
"Supergirl",2016-04-23," For what it's trying to be, Supergirl is a great show. It's family-friendly and PC in every possible way (to the point of shoving it down our throats) and it's actually a lot of fun... sometimes. In between the cheesy dialogue and grating pop singles, there are some very cool moments in Supergirl. There's a potentially great antihero in Maxwell Lord, a promising cast altogether, oh, and J'onn freakin' J'onzz - far and away the best thing about the show. There is clever dialogue sprinkled around and a few character beats do pay off in the finale, but the best episodes are the oddballs. The White Martian versus The Green Martian, The Flash crossover (I do hope they do more because their chemistry was phenomenal), creepy freak-of-the-weeks like Toyman, threatening villains like Non - that's the kind of badass comic book hero stuff I want to see. Not awkward banter between a love triangle (or rectangle) or them degrading Superman in every possible respect (it's funny when they instant message but literally every other reference to Clark puts him in a negative light).It's a show with potential, and if it is to continue, some things need to go. Tone down the overtly PC writing, get rid of the pop songs, give the effects department a bigger budget, overall more action, less talking, and this could be a winner. But as of right now, Supergirl has all the potential in the world. And that's all it has. ","6"
"Supergirl",2016-04-21," this series is not even a good try of supergirl no offense of the girl acting her she did here best but there was no power at all. She is not a fighter but she is cute my advise for next super girl series make her a bit darker i mean like the Man of steal movie or yes The Arrow is pretty good and a bit dark cause if you want to tell a pretty awesome story you do not make a children's show or am i wrong there are people in this series that belong in As the world turns and yes i meant that in a bad way this should be a Action scifi and not a bad drama series i hope i see it in my life time a more thrilling supergirl then i have seen in the past greetings from Holland ","6"
"Supergirl",2016-04-19," Let's get one thing out of the way right away, I'm not a DC Universe fan boy and I couldn't tell you much about any of the people on this show. Nor have I watched the other shows these guys produced like The Flash so i come into this unbiased. I'm not trashing this show just because I think I'm smarter than the creative team. I can discount some of the complaints (or chips on their shoulders I should say) about feminism because the show is called SuperGirl. It's pretty obvious who the center of attention will be. This is your typical hero in the spotlight show with sidekicks and the sidekicks happen to be two dudes. Yeah, the computer guy is a little too sensitive to be believable and the black photographer guy is too wise to be believable. But, putting that aside, let's talk about the real problems here.The series structure is the real problem. Even starting with the pilot, the show runs away too fast. This is probably due to the way they wanted to make the series. Every episode Supergirl has to solve  a case  aka Fight someone while there are attempts to weave a background story along the way.The acting, it's all over the place. Sometimes Kara comes off believable but just as many times it just doesn't work. Her baddie aunt never comes off well. The only person who comes off consistently good in the show is the DEO head (Martian black guy).The costumes, as indicated I'm no fan boy and the SuperGirl costume works fine for me. If there's a better one, I haven't seen it. This talk about it looking like a Halloween costume I don't get. If anything, some of the various villain costumes suffer more than anything else. But, that's another issue caused by the structure of the series.The effects, like the acting, the effects are a mixed bag. Some of them actually look really good. Some others look like something someone did on a home PC.The structure of the series is causing almost every issue. After watching 9 episodes, there is very little character arc going on. We're in too much of a rush to even go there. The villains in the show are paper thin. Who has time for that when this week we're fighting nuclear man and next week we're fighting a robot? How can you spend the time to choreograph a good fight scene and effects when these things happen almost every episode? And the fights don't matter very much if the audience isn't invested in the characters (villains too). They're just an excuse to show off a mixed bag of effects, there's no tension. Some of the villains look crappy because there's too dang many of them. If there would have been 3 or 4 the whole season, they would have looked 3x better and the effects would have been solid throughout.So in short, this show is just terribly uneven because of the way they decided to make it. Take a series like DareDevil, different structure and different result. I could see how some people would like the show. In reality, SuperGirl is less a serious TV show and more like a live action version of the Super Friends cartoon. It has about the same level of depth to it as a cartoon. For a series so uneven, I think a 4 out of 10 is a fair score. ","4"
"Supergirl",2016-04-19," The main problem with the whole story and with all of these new DC series is that they don's show the darknes what is made DC. If I want to watch fun and superheros talking about hope and miracles and they just talk the bad out of the villains I would watch some , I don't even know, because they are superheros they suppose to fight, but in these series , yes they fight , but these are just not frigthening nor interesting. No one ever dies. It's not what DC is about. They should show the dark side of this superhero nonsense, but they just become Marvel and making these thing for 6 years old. But I can't figure out why. Most of the people who goes to convetions, cons etc., they are adults. Why can't they be true to themselves and make a good, dark series with real DC heroes. They only series that based on DC and is good it's Gotham. That shows the draknes and how lightnes can shine througth it, if they keep figthing for. They not just magicly speak with the bad guys who turning into good guys after it. ","2"
"Supergirl",2016-04-19," watching the characters aches my eyes, the script writers have a very crappy visions and imaginations Don't WATCH that is what i would suggest.. Superman becomes an useless hero Supergirl is as dumb as ever.. always the others have more powers than the ones who were supposed to have a lot more abilities..Hmm here they can never use them efficiently.. what is this folks?? The script writers should consider to be more creative in order to save the show.. right now it becomes more and more boring with lots of words but really small actions and weak supers do not match the real Superman and Supergirl Work on that do not make that girl look so stupid that bores and makes the show unbearable believe me ","1"
"Supergirl",2016-04-18," The show had potential but the weak link with Superman and the awful way they try to keep him out of the show just killed it. It is just so stupid to try to keep Superman out of world threatening events with ridiculous excuses!Out of the planet mission? Seriously? Besides that the story line is pretty good and the casting acceptable. But the whole Superman thing doesn't allow me to rate it more than 5 out of 10.Hopefully Superman will be present during season 2 if there is any! The show also needs to get a little more mature and darker. It is not the 1970s. It should follow the general trend of other shows like Arrow that mainly aim to adult viewers and not children! ","5"
"Supergirl",2016-04-18," Although (and granted) it was good attempt on bringing Supergirl to TV, the show itself is too campy, too PC, too awkward & too jovial for me. The cast did an amazing job. Hats off to Melissa Benoist & the rest of the cast for their performance but THIS Supergirl was more cheerful and more of a pacifist than the brash and defiant personality she has in the comics. Also they used the same plot device that was used in both Arrow & The Flash (2014)For the rest of the cast, Alex is (believe it or not), a scene stealer and more of a Supergirl than Supergirl herself. It's the 3rd TV adaptation to have an original character as a main character.Winn (Toyman) is the 2nd character that is in actually (soon to be) a supervillain since Caitlin Snow (Killer Frost) in The Flash (2014)Jimmy Olsen was.... So So. though i did like his Signal Watch.Cat Grant.... This version, she has an ego the size of Apokolips. VERY COLD. I'm surprised Kara put up with her.J'onn Jozz was the only reason this show is improving but slowly.Lucy, Gen. Lane & Max Lord was also decent.Good moments: Omegahedron, Martian Manhunter, The Flash (guest starring), the villains (Reactron, Silver Banshee, Livewire, etc.), The Superman alum: Helen Slater, Laura Vandervoort (2 ex-Girls of Steel) and Dean Cain, decent fight sequences. Less on Superman.The Flaws: Pointless speeches & life lessons, a  Team Supergirl  (ala Team Arrow & Team Flash), Supergirl working for the DEO, chessy dialogue, being PC, Vartox, Red Tornado, Maxima, Jemm & Indigo are the villains (in actually are the heroes), Supergirl being careless by revealing her identity, having her suit man made, Supergirl trying to be like her cousin.All in all, this show was campy, jovial & fluffy for my taste. Even Mars' last survivor & the Scarlet Speedster couldn't save this show. However, IF they do get a season 2 (minus the flaws), it should be respecting the source material, make it relevant, twists, good fight sequences, dialogue. no plot devices & better character developments, the show would be a little better.I gave Supergirl a 2 out of 10.

"Supergirl",2016-04-17," First of all we know what society is pointing to today!!!.I was more looking for something to watch that has good language and good action plus motivating at the same time but just a few episodes I watched and I did realized this was pointing to one road.This was basically mean't for the young audience and younger females.What I don't understand today is men being pushed out slowly out authority and society today.Look on it on the longer side,most of the villains in the TV series are men.Come on men are suppose to be protectors which In fact why we were made to be stronger beings! What I hate is to see a woman saving people and being beaten with brute force once again by''men mainly most of the times''This is not a woman's role.Not to be a make believe hero saving people's life no we are the one's to protect them not us being their enemies and it all boils to society Its a female world today ''wake up and smell the coffee.Where are most of the fathers and men in 'prison yes they are and the show definitely does not encouraged me to be accepted as a male in society I feel stupid and hopeless like if anyone wants to accept males in society today.If you're a female watched the show and feel motivated I encourage you.Not intended for male audiences my age sorry ''spoiler alert'' ","2"
"Supergirl",2016-04-17," I tried so hard to like Supergirl because I love The Flash and like Arrow but I cringe Every time I try to watch it. The acting is atrocious! Why they got Flockhart out of retirement just to torture us with her one dimensional acting is beyond me. The effects are beyond believable and I have seen 10 year olds create better fire effects with free special effects programs not to forget the ridiculous flying scenes. The storyline is idiotic and so contradictory I can't believe some people actually like the show. I really think with the lack of good programs lately, people will watch just about anything, even this garbage. Supergirl was sent to earth to protect superman and yet she is absolutely useless and keeps on getting bashed up! Supergirl is trying to ride the  superhero  wave and failing dismally. I will be shocked if it continues for a second season but I suppose a lot of really young kids might be watching it because anyone with half a brain would find it tedious. ","1"
"Supergirl",2016-03-30," Melissa Benoist cannot act. Calista Flockhart is not believable. They should have cast a sexy and busty supergirl. Not a flighty, cutesy- tootsy light weight, thin stick, unshapely woman. This show appeals to liberals, feminists and homosexuals. Completely tries to insult real Americans and forces unnatural and unlikely scenarios. In particular, the attraction for the one black guy (Jimmy) like he is the only man on Earth. Plus, his character is so misplaced. Just doesn't feel right. You can say 2016 all you want but it doesn't fit the DC story line. This series might appeal to children, but I can't watch it anymore with so many other sci-fi's to choose from. So disappointed. ","1"
"Supergirl",2016-03-30," Super girl is a brand new spin on the character. Being in the same universe as Flash and Arrow, there is a lot of enjoyable scenes and great lines. Melisa Benoist is great playing the girl of steel. There are some dry scenes, especially the romance scenes. The rest of the cast is very astonishing. Everything from Toyman to Indigo are great villains. Some aren't the best. Like Livewire, but she is a OK character. Overall the series is amazing, a fun mixture of Flash and Batgirl.The series is connected to the Flaroww verse, but is located on Earth-3. I would love to see a season 2, even more on Legends of tomorrow. ","8"
"Supergirl",2016-03-29," First 3-4 episodes are awful, but if you manage to resist the temptation to quit watching you might find yourself astonished by the direction this show took.As stated, the first few episodes present some of the most cringe worthy, cheesy and strained TV moments I've ever witnessed. First thing people notice is Supergirl's appearance and Melissa Benoist is a cute blonde cheerleader type of a girl. Mix that with a female dominated cast and corny dialogue and you get a chick flick for 13 years old girls. Luckily, someone in the production recognized this problem in time and successfully pointed in the right direction.From that point on the show continued in decent manner. Adding little mystery and emotion to characters made them more likable, balancing the story arcs, character relationships and pace made it entertaining to watch.Give it a try past first few episodes and then come up with your own conclusion!

"Supergirl",2016-03-29," Melissa Benoist does a great job at giving Supergirl and her civilian character Kara, some identity. I've read a lot of Supergirl comics and watched all incarnations on cartoons and movies. Her identity seems to be: that she has no identity (mostly in relation to Superman). So that's where Melissa succeeds. She is adorable as awkward Kara and convincing as cool, strong Supergirl.Her supporting cast is strongly portrayed: Jimmy Olsen is OK, her sister is really good, and Jonn Jonzz is awesome. I still find Calista Flockhart super weird but since she is often on Supergirls side, I will root for her.The show is comparable to the Flash, with many cameos, heroes and villains, which gives you great bang for your buck. Something they did in the early episodes was end the show with Kara IM'ing with Clark Kent in Metropolis. I loved this familial interaction! I don't understand why they have to live separate lives. Wish they would keep doing this.I like how not every episode is according to formula, where we watch Supergirl get beat up by a new villain, they find a solution, and they win. I liked the episode focused on Jonn Jonzz, giving Kara a break.Supergirl is just a good a show as Arrow, Flash, or Agents of Shield. DC's only miss so far is Legends of Tomorrow. If CBS doesn't renew it i don't understand why the CW wouldn't. We need you Supergirl! ","9"
"Supergirl",2016-03-29," To be honest! I don't consider it as superhero movie. last episode I watched because of flash and I just stopped watching it after first 3 episode! I think there are big major mistakes like.1- Poor Story line. (No one want to see the aliens more) 2- Poor Acting (female character is really not charming and attractive for this role) all other supporting role are also facing similar problem)I think! this series will be cancelled anytime. really messed up when there is great series like arrow and flash. Simple! Change the Actors in this series and you will get some chance to get some reputation. ","1"
"Supergirl",2016-03-26," I grew slowly but steadily into a fan of series Arrow, Flash, Dc legends of tomorrow. And Supergirl could not miss from this basket. It's true that the first episodes are targeting apparently the female young viewers, with girly issues and romances. However as the show develops, its characters gain in depth and interest while introducing at the same time other classical Dc characters. The woman ruled environment may annoy male audience, only until they realise the eye-candies that are hiding behind a secretary desk, a uniform, or some tights. I ended up preferring it over the now Felicity-ruled-Arrow and became my 2nd favorite after Flash ","10"
"Supergirl",2016-03-25," When I first started watching Supergirl, I couldn't help but roll my eyes at the heavy handed female empowerment message and the somewhat cheesy writing. Don't get me wrong, I'm all for female empowerment, but it's really not necessary to bash us over the head with the same message every five minutes every episode. Really. We got it the first time. Due to the cheesiness of the first episode, I wasn't sure that I would keep watching. The characters were struggling to find out who and how they were and it was a rough start with inconsistent writing, to say the least. However, just out of curiosity's sake, I decided to watch the next episode. And then the next. And then the next. Thankfully, each episode is better than the last- the dialogue is better, the message is more subtle, the characters have found their place. I highly recommend that you stick through the first few episodes, I promise it gets better and it's worth the effort! I'm really looking forward to seeing where this series will go. I think it has a lot of potential, and I'm glad to hear it has been renewed for a second season! I hear there's going to be Flash crossovers (and hopefully some Emerald Archer ones?) too. We are literally living in the best time for superhero movies and TV. All in all, so far, Supergirl is great, fun, family friendly, evening entertainment! 7/10 stars ","7"
"Supergirl",2016-03-24," Supergirl may have started roughly but as the weeks go on, the show really starts to find its footing. It is a light hearted show with great actors. At times, the writing can get a little clunky but Melissa Benoist, Chyler Leigh, Calista Flockhart, and Laura Benanti really bring a lot to it and many times show more through their acting than words. The female relationships on the show are incredibly important and worth following as the show develops. Calista Flockhart is truly a gem that brings levity to every scene she's in while also portraying a complex women with a checked past that wants to help her protégé learn and grow. I would highly recommend this show to anyone who was looking for a fun, family friendly, superhero drama ","10"
"Supergirl",2016-03-24," I binge-watched all 17 episodes in less than a week and let me just say that I love the dynamics between the female characters in the series- this includes the not so friendly ones found in the likes of Astra, Siobhan, and Livewire. I love that most of the women take up space and are powerful and are three-dimensional. Also the POC are not background characters and call the shots too; I'm heart-eyes for James Olsen, so fond of Hank, and in awe with Lucy. The acting is ace as well. Calista Flockhart is simply phenomenal, Melissa Benoist is just inspiring and I want to take her home with me! Chyler Leigh too deserves a shout out because Alex is so badass and at the same time huggable. I love that this show is so positive and also manages to bring up issues that deserve to be talked about. I'm looking forward to what happens next and I hope we get a Season 2! ","10"
"Supergirl",2016-03-24," I've seen so many reviews bashing this show as being too tropey, too silly, and my personal favorite, 'too feminist'. As if comic books themselves aren't tropey and at times, silly. In the same breath it's accused of being too radical. A black Jimmy Olsen? How dare they? Supergirl's hair isn't blonde enough? The scandal! Here's the thing about this show. It's far from perfect. The pilot, at times, felt like a kid high off candy - too excitable to be charming. The first few episodes stumbled through a plot. Writing has been somewhat inconsistent, and yes, characters have been changed from their traditional comic-book origins. But the show has been consistent with one thing - it captures the essence of Supergirl. This isn't Arrow or Gotham, where Man!Pain fuels the story along. It isn't supposed to be. This is the story about a young woman coming into her own. Of course it's going to have a strong feminist angle. After years of listening to whiny male superheroes, I'm delighted that we finally have a hero, dealing with balancing what it means to be a woman with what it means to be a superhero. This is designed to be a show that parents can watch with their kids. That doesn't make it infantile or immature, but it does mean that it's going to be lighter than say Arrow. This isn't a bad thing.The show has been consistently getting better. It does a fantastic job of showing off the Superman mythos, while keeping it about Kara, reminding us that this is her story. It has a great cast of women.Melissa Benoist absolutely captures Kara's dorky persona, as well as the strength of Supergirl. She's a revelation, after watching so many heroes brood on our screens. Calista Flockhart is not just the bitchy boss; she's shown to care deeply about National City and Supergirl herself. She plays the role with so many nuances, it's fascinating to watch. Chyler Leigh, who plays Kara's sister, Alex is equally engaging, and it's refreshing seeing a cast of female characters who aren't sniping or plotting against each other. This show might have taken a while to find its feet, but it's getting there, and the ride has been an enjoyable one. This show has become charming and sweet, and quirky and everything I would have expected from Supergirl. It focuses on hope and friendship and family and why should these values be ridiculed just because they're championed by a girl? ","8"
"Supergirl",2016-03-04," Lets make this short. This series started out a promising, then it degenerated into a drama feast. The drama got so heavy that i had to put my hand on the fast forward on the remote control continuously.This series is so cheap that it even fails at being a soap opera (with shitty action scenes).I thought this series was to be an action and adventure genre, the crying and emotional roller-coaster always got me cringing my teeth.I rated this show high when the first episode came out, however I was totally disappointed when the other episodes came out.Please if you want to keep your emotions intact stay away from crap like this. ","2"
"Supergirl",2016-03-02," The show started off rocky. The pilot was terrible but I decided to continue watching it because my 2 daughters liked it. It does have a 'girl power' theme and a very strong relationship driven story, which I love and I feel is very positive for my girls. All the characters grew into their own skin probably around episode 6 and after. From then on, it was very enjoyable to watch. Melissa Benoist took a while but got into her role, there was a lot of key moments that showed her acting props - showing vulnerability and strength at the right moments. I'm gonna keep on watching this as I'm getting really fond of all the characters - even the passive aggressive Cat Grant - which may not be Calista Flockhart's greatest role, but an interesting one none the less. ","9"
"Supergirl",2016-03-01," i actually looked forward to this show when i heard it was going to be on c.b.s. but what i got was the worst form of TV, basically just a agenda of how we all should try to live together, doesn't matter if you are a alien with 4 eyes ,or you are pink with purple spots.then we got the supergirl herself-who has to be one of the worst actresses in the world.the plots are down right stupid. in this version jimmy is a black photographer who knew who superman was.calista flockhart as the mean ole editor,but she is really not that mean.like a movie this year called fantastic four, they changed so many items from the original supergirl, and made it a love story, why in the hell can you not have a story which is only about supergirl-no supergirl 7th grade love life?this show sucks big time.1 of the worst on TV.remember batman from the 1960's why cant you have made super girl more like that-fun,but not a 7th grade romance. ","1"
"Supergirl",2016-03-01," So I saw a lot of people giving it a bad review just by watching one or two episodes. I completely disagree to them. The show is getting better by each coming episode. They need to work on visual effects a little, but apart from that I am really enjoying it. I suggest people to watch it as it is actually going good and slowly gaining pace for further seasons. Also a lot of crossovers are there to come soon as DC is bringing multi-verse to the TV and thus I am hoping for it to become more fun very soon. From acting point of view, everybody seems to be doing a brilliant role. Melissa Benoist has shown great potential as Kara and as Supergirl. Calista Flockhart is doing a brilliant job as Cat Grant.In short, a series worth watching. ","9"
"Supergirl",2016-02-26," Go ahead and watch the show. I desperately tried to like it but there is so much to not like. Utter garbage. The show prides itself on being true to the comic and not being biased.When in reality its the opposite. Clearly the jokes are based off of recent one liners you hear from high schoolers. This will surely embarrass any true fan out there to the superman series. Just a heads up to all who believe it would be good its just an attempt at making the other audience (women) feel like they are important too. Ladies you are important believe me. We never said you weren't. But good god this isn't the way to get anyones attention other than to change the channel.just watch and be amazed.Awful job guys. Awful. ","1"
"Supergirl",2016-02-25," I thought this might be a good show but there is only so much political reeducation dogma you can smuggle into my house disguised by a cute young girl in a superhero mini-costume. There has been quite a bit recently but in the latest episode the un-freckled and un-redhead Jimmy Olsen castigated Supergirl for  running her own private Guantanamo  which was not only a pretty harsh falsehood, was politically timed dogma. Supergirl did not even stand up for herself but instead caved...because everyone is supposed to automatically agree that Guantanamo = bad. Never mind that it's not her department (she's not in charge). She doesn't own the lock-down which is run by the government to secure dangerous aliens. Never mind that she can't shut it down and should not be responsible for releasing anyone, she completely was blamed.Ultimately in the story she was the one that had to act. She releases a dangerous criminal to the streets because holding him even with the 'room full of criminal case files against him' was  wrong . OK, I'm willing to stipulate that holding US citizens without due process is wrong.. but you don't do what our president does and release dangerous people to the streets to make a political statement. They need to be tried and if convicted go to prison. That's what you do with US citizens who break the law and for whom you have collected a preponderance of evidence to convict. Notice they did not address the alien terrorists which there evidently were quite a few. Can you imagine the disaster releasing alien terrorists to the streets would cause? Yep they didn't address this because even they know this would be a no win for them.It's a minor point but it's enough to be annoying. Watching the show I felt compelled to stop the show and teach my kids why what Jimmy Olsen said to Kara was wrong. Please try not to teach my children incorrect principles. thanks a lot Supergirl. ","4"
"Supergirl",2016-02-25," I really want to like this show. It has some great moments and a likable lead. That's the good side, now for the darkside:1) Please, please, please try to keep the plot holes from multiplying like rabbits on a diet of Viagra. Example: the first episode where Supergirl meets her evil aunt, she thinks she is her mother, but learns in a bit of  evil guy dialog  that she is her aunt that she was never told about. A few episodes later we find out that Kara and her aunt were once the best of buds... what the Hell. 2)Preach it baby. This show is very much in tune with women rule and boys drool, especially white boys. ALL the major villains are white guys full of  white privilege . General Lang, Mr. Lords, Nom(the real Kryptonian villain as his wife - Kara's aunt - is really a good person inside), the Trickster, all evil white guys. The heroes are selected from a college course on women and minority studies. I have no problem with heroes being of whatever color or gender. I do have a problem when the show gets preachy about how white guys are evil and stacks the deck in such a way that it is painfully obvious. The only sympathetic white guy is a nerd and even with that his dad is evil. 3) Too much suspension of belief. Not the lasers coming out of Supergirl's eyes. The fact that she would love her job working for Han Solo's wife (Flockart)who plays an utterly detestable character who has the heart of the Grinch, Donald Trump's narcissism and Hillary Clinton's bitchy I can do no wrong attitude. Sometimes it is funny how over the top she plays the role, reminds me of Shatner's acting skills. 4) Why are they ruining the role of Jimmy Olsen? In NO universe is Jimmy a highly confident tall muscely black man. Where is the awkward red head with freckles. I'm sure they did this because this show is more concerned with appeasing the PC gods (see #2). Sad that they could not be a bit truer to the source material. Will I keep watching the show, maybe. I do get tired of the disjointed plots and every show learning about how evil white guys are, but it does at times redeem itself. They better move their low bar a little higher and soon. ","4"
"Supergirl",2016-02-24," Supergirl aka Kara Zor-El is supposed to be 16 years of age by the time Superman is 29 years of age in the comic book storyline their following as in the movie 1984 Supergirl movie Helen Slater was 20 years of age playing a school girl while Christopher Reeve was in 30'sThe title is just wholly sexist title for the series just makes your blood boil, Just call it Super Women, they try to use a get out of jail clause by using the female magazine editor Calista Flockhart create the name in story saying she created Supergirl not Otto Binder from DC in 1959! Overall Melissa Benoist is too old play SuperGirl but old enough to play Superwoman !The TV series lacks total originality is just blatantly ripping off Superman story if your just going to replicate Clarke Kent mild mannered reporter with Kara Danvars.Smallville clone would have been better story vehicle inspiring young girls who get bullied in school and courageously turning the other cheek, similar to Joss Whedon's Buffy Vampire slayer ","2"
"Supergirl",2016-02-24," With an influx of superhero TV series and movies, I was excited to see a show that features a female superhero.Unfortunately, after watching 3 episodes of Supergirl, I couldn't watch more of this garbage.As much as I appreciate family orientated television series, it's a fact that family-friendly theme and excellent acting/dialogue are NOT mutually exclusive!The plot is too uninspiring, and the characters are dull, immature, and lacking in sophistication in some form of character development. It made no sense that a group of 20 year old are behaving like egocentric school age children.The scripts are terribly written, acting is cringe-worthy, CG seems outdated, and the overall execution is very disappointing.I really wanted to like this show, but there is just too many things to dislike about Supergirl. ","1"
"Supergirl",2016-02-23," The show is absolutely awful. Promised a female hero, and instead we get a whiny female teen who needs government handlers to tell her when to blast meaningless baddies Superman is conveniently too busy to handle with her eye lasers because apparently, she can't even make that decision without consulting with someone.Those are, by the way, my fiancé's words on the show. She absolutely loathes it. In fact, she watches Skorpion some nights, but will change the channel when Supergirl starts and change it back when its over.The problem is the writing. The show is really, really awful. The dialogue is cheesy; the villain of the week flavor structure is sad and renders any bad guy meaningless. Changing Jimmy Olsen the way they did also irked me, personally <U+0096> not because they made him black <U+0096> I could care less about the skin color of the actor <U+0096> but because apparently, the bespectacled, somewhat clumsy yet lovable Jimmy Olsen somehow wasn't good enough for this cast. And let's not forget all that talking about FRIENDZONE<U+0085>. Seriously? Can this show be more immature than that? I'm not against memes, sometimes they can be fun, but to see grown ups talking about friendzone in the work place makes me think if the script for this show isn't actually being made by teens, who can't even read aloud what they're writing.Now about the female example of strong and independent woman, I think Supergirl isn't even trying. I would watch a show about Felicity Smoak alone, instead of Supergirl. She has the character, the presence and personality you hope to see in a fictional being, everything needed to make her more believable, while Kara <U+0096> although I really like the actress herself <U+0096> has even less personality than the heroes from Teen Titans cartoon.Oh, and one last thing: After watching Daredevil on Netflix and seeing the clever tie-in to the Marvel Universe used to explain his uniform, and how he went about getting, the lets-play-dressup method for the two person committee who designed Supergirl's costume in the pilot was laughably pathetic. It was, once more, my fiancé who first pointed this out and I agreed with her immediately. ","1"
"Supergirl",2016-02-22," First Off the veiled racist outrage at a Black male on White female Interracial romance is hilarious to me. That aside I love the show. Melissa Benoist plays Supergirl in a way that is very balanced and has a wholesome innocence in her delivery. The whole cast are really good actors but for me the action sequences and introduction of new Villain's each week is the real star. I hope Supergirl and Jimmy's romance gets hot and heavy if for no reason but to introduce people to the 21st Century. I'll admit I also watch to see where it goes. I hope they get renewed because I look forward to seeing the new alien or villain they will face each week. i also like the fact that not every problem requires a hammer. Supergirl is well thought out. kudos to the Cast and crew their work is appreciated. ","7"
"Supergirl",2016-02-16," Green Martians? And now White Martians too? This show is great except for above. Too much suspension of disbelief required when we've got a bunch of rovers on Mars showing no life! Krypton and other distant fictional worlds are fine. But if you include a world we know a lot about (Mars) and say these sentient aliens with powers came from there and offer no further explanation...then it's just dumb! If you want to blur the lines between fact and fiction...you got to do it right and make things seem plausible like in DaVinci's Code. Just putting a green Martian into the show out of the blue is insane. Yeah it might have a background in comics, but many viewers don't read comics. ","8"
"Supergirl",2016-02-12," It is great to see a TV show with women of power at its center. Despite the fact that Calista Flockhart has the tendency to look slightly non-emotive in certain scenes, due to the lack of movement in her forehead region, she still manages to pull off the queen of media empires quite well.Melissa Benoist's performance as Kara proves that a woman can be central to a television series while still being seen as something other than a sex object.I, personally, am quite the fan of the feminist undercurrent this show has to it, despite the claims of other reviewers on this site. I also like the fact that we are not subjected to an exact copy of the comic book whereby we are forced to stick to a lovely format. But God forbid someone to be black and bald instead of white and ginger. But lets face it, you'd complain if this show were whitewashed to oblivion too. ","8"
"Supergirl",2016-02-11," First things first. After seeing some of the reviews on here about this series, SERIOUS consideration needs to be taken into account that MARVEL does NOT completely follow their own story lines either, citing that Tony Stark did not create Ultron like in the movie, as Hank Pym did in the comics for example... So to discredit this show on the basis of it not following the comic is ridicoulous. The show is what you make of it. In general, it is all set for the imagination. Helen Slater's Supergirl, came from Argo City, as Benoist came from Krypton to protect Superman. Does it really matter how the  Mythology  is told, or how the story develops? Supergirl, whether 1984, or time now, was a little quirky and naive, yet strong-willed and opinionated in her character and that is still instilled in the same character be it Slater or Benoist. The show itself started a little clunky at first, and I will admit with Hank, I had no clue who he was with the red eyes. But that was what captivated me. If someone didn't know by now, I was really surprised and actually did research on the Martian Manhunter when I found out about J'onn Jones. It took me back to watching Super Friends cartoons when I was a kid with him.Maybe Supergirl wasn't a one hero show, but by adding another element into it like J'onn they definitely added interest, and added elements for a deeper well-defined story. For a first season, it definitely deserves 2 more seasons to develop and see how it continues. Possibly do Flash, and Arrow cameos every now and again.Supergirl is still Supergirl, with an update from 1984. And Melissa Benoist does the part justice. We just need to see where it goes from here. ","9"
"Supergirl",2016-02-10," This show as we all know had a rough start, they wanted to make a geeky CBS show and that doesn't just fit well with the modern DC superhero, I can say I lost hope but it all changed in the episode they switched due to similarities to true life situations, that was when it found the right balance of seriousness and humour, you could immediately feel the stakes increase,the battle with Astra is greatest super powered fight on TV, I am addicted to this show, I just cannot miss it this show has found the right balance of everything. Watch it you will not regret. The visuals are state of the art, Kara might just be the cutest superhero of all times, she manages to make everything look cute and her chemistry with cat is something that is becoming rare to see this days on television, a proper mentor- student relationship. ","10"
"Supergirl",2016-02-10," Okay, where to start. This is 2016, era of the comics movies and TV shows. Movies like Man of Steel, The Avengers have set the bar pretty high for the quality of the TV shows that are following them. In accordance to that, and the DC shows which are running right now, Supergirl has the weakest story line, CGI and not to mention, science of it.Well, science is a tricky part when you're dealing with a being of god-like powers. Still, in The Flash, when he runs at Supersonic speeds, he usually breaks glasses around him (Later the Speed Force keeps him from destroying stuff around him while running fast). Yet in the Supergirl promo/trailer, we see her creating a sonic boom while flying away in front of Catco..leaving the glass buildings around her intact. Anyway, it's not so important for everyone. Then there is the scenario where two super-powered beings are fighting. It's like watching Rousey and Holm fight. In MoS, when Supes and Zod were at it, super-powered beings as they are..created shock-waves with each punch they were throwing at one another, trail of destruction piled up as a consequence of the fight. Yet in the show, we see multiple super beings fight with little to no redress around structures to follow. Watching two powerful beings fight should be a feast for the eyes in this era with the CGI effects and all, but sigh. It's like watching Smallville all over again.Talking about Smallville, Kryptonite was basically sold at random shops for free almost and government had infinite access to them, even though it's supposed to be a super rare element. Glimpse of the same domain can be seen in this show.Although started off too cheesy, it did get a bit better with the story later on adding a low point..too much spices were added in a simple soup dish. I am still hopeful for this show, given that writing several stories and scripts about an overpowered being can be difficult. ","5"
"Supergirl",2016-02-09," When I first watched the pilot- it seemed like a flop and a show that I couldn't spare time for especially with the Arrow and Flash giving great episodes every week. But I came back to it when they said that The Flash was crossing over. And let me tell you- from the 3rd episode onwards- it's a hell of a ride. It picked up the same vibe as the Flash (get it? Vibe?). The show evolved dimensions and when they added more and more characters from the DC mainstream like a certain very famous alien- it's now on par with the flash. As of episode 13- this show is going great. Hope it gets even better and CBS picks it for another 4-5 seasons at least cause this show has potential.Sure Jimmy was like a thorn in the show but how they've integrated him now is worth watching. And it has a much better season so far as compared to Marvel's Agents of shield season 1. Give it a shot. And haters- please do not use feminism and casting as a way to show your disinterest. Of course a show with a female superhero will have to deal with real world female problems. You can't expect Ms. Benoist to start acting like Stephen Amell in Arrow. It's a family show that delivers what it sets out to do. Seriously- I can't wait for the crossover on 28th March 2016. Hope they have more of that. ","10"
"Supergirl",2016-02-08," When I saw episode #1, I thought this was the worst comic book superhero show today and possibly one of the worst shows period in any genre. Based on the pilot, the problem was simple - total lack of character development of Supergirl. I don't want to see her learn all the tricks, fly, and start saving falling planes overnight. I wanted to see it developed over time.I want to see her grow up with all the growing pains. My feelings didn't change after episode 2.I was still disappointed after episodes 3 & 4. But I think after episode 5, it just grew on me. The show got a little more serious. It is a balancing act doing the right thing. Do you believe in the death penalty even for monsters and killers? Is it okay to kill as long as you are only killing other killers (like the show Dexter) ?One thing about Supergirl I like that no other Superman/Supergirl show or movie has ever showed - Supergirl learning martial arts. It makes perfect sense to me. I was glad to see this. Why didn't Superman learn martial arts? There are other alien reprobates who are just as strong. But if Superman knew martial arts, he could better fight them. Anyway, I see at times that Supergirl really wants to kill the villains or have her own brand of justice. It's her struggle. I like that. So the take home message is this. Supergirl doesn't have the best writing or acting. The actresses are all pretty and easy on the eye. The show gets better over time. It grows on you. And you may get addicted to Supergirl like me. ","10"
"Supergirl",2016-02-08," After yet another bad episode, I wonder: how long can this last? The writing is just so very, very bad. For Supergirl to give a speech in the middle of a fight is just mindless. I'm reminded of a scene in the movie 'Van Helsing,' when one of Dracula's vampire wives is going to kill the princess (Kate Beckinsdale), she taunts her, finally ending  What do you think of that?  And Beckinsdale's character stabs her with a pointy stake and responds,  I think if you're going to kill someone, just kill them, don't talk them to death.  THIS is how so many scenes in Supergirl are: punch, give a speech (usually,  You don't have to do this ), get knocked down/ thrown 100 feet away, get up, fly back, get punched again, fly out of the way just as the killing blow is about to be administered, then punch her adversary ______(fill in the villain) and end the fight. The Supergirl character is simply too dumb to be believable.Add to this the many DEO agents who, by now, must know her 'secret identity,  if it can be called that, since, in the course of 4 episodes, at least 3 people learn of her identity, not to mention Maxwell Lord, who is far too smart to not put 2 and 2 together and realize she's related to  Agent Danvers.  Chalk this up to the writers, who write for a first grade level (no insult intended to the many (much) smarter 1st graders out there. One minute she's angry and the next scene, she's happy and smiling even though she she's had to watch someone killed/maimed/tortured. The recovery time of her emotions would work for a sociopath, but not the kindhearted human being she is. It's too weak for words. Speaking of weak, her powers are abominably poor for a 'Super Girl.' She's been on earth for a decade or so, yet can't even lift a plane finger, struggles to get out of quicksand,can't dodge a gun, fist, or bomb at all, and, just plain slow in her use of her powers. If she was in a boxing ring, she'd be out after the first round. I like Benoit, because I can see her goodness, but in something like Supergirl, to use Mae West's phrase:  Goodness has(d) nothing to do with it.  ","1"
"Supergirl",2016-02-08,"  Supergirl  is a 'new' take on DC Comics' character and explores what it's like being a female super hero in a world where everyone already looks at the man of steel as their sole protector. Unlike Superman's solitary role, Supergirl is someone intricately tied to her friends and family, great part of her strength coming from values such as friendship and kindness -- something which today, on television, is rarely seen in such a raw, campy manner. With every episode, the show carries positive messages, feminist reinforcement for the many women who admire and take inspiration from a character like Supergirl. It carries that 1990's spirit that characterised popular TV series like Xena or Buffy: women are just as capable of getting things done, and have no need to fight other women for it.Some level of criticism can be applied to how some episodes roll out, the general plot itself, or sometimes the overacting/stiffness of a character here and there but these are minimal things that shouldn't detract from enjoying the show itself because this is being developed on a different scope from other super hero shows, and it's fairly ridiculous to try and compare them when the differences are pretty clear.Which brings to my final point that it's disingenuous that negative reviews that employ such language as  political correctness  or  feminist propaganda  continue to be featured as the hallmark of opinion on the show, not the expected commentary for a primary male demographic that has a hard time accepting that TV series can also be made with the aim of appealing to female demographics and providing them a source of not only entertainment but confidence and feminist empowerment.

"Supergirl",2016-01-05," I don't even know where to begin... it's bland-as-hell, uninspired, feels like a mishmash of all the other procedural on CBS but instead of the lead having super-memory or some other trait she happens to be an alien and will chase down a new baddie each week with some vague season-long plot slowly teased out. Nothing sets this show apart from the other comic book shows currently on the air. Just totally forgettable. Instead of watching this, go watch ABC/Marvel's Agent Carter or Jessica Jones. By the end of the first (double) episode I totally got why they felt Carter was worthy of her own spin-off. She definitely holds her own. It's a smart, well-written well-paced show and shows how you build a comic book show around a smart, strong female character. It's a fairly feminist show without ever ever feeling like one (no big speechifying about sexism or anything, Carter just kicks ass and takes names while her male co- workers/bosses tell her to get them a coffee instead of doing men's work). AC's take on Mad Men-era rampant casual sexism is totally different (and way superior) to Supergirl dancing around it with a 'oh you don't think she can't beat so-and-so villain? Why because she's a GIRL?!' manner. ","1"
"Supergirl",2016-01-04," I understand the point of super girl and that was to create a super hero for women to look up too but i think with this new series super girl they could have done a much better job. Its like this series was created fast thinking that it would be a hit just because all the other hero series where very good so they thought this one would get the same reaction. I believe this one is very corny honestly. I think Jessica Jones is much better and more fun to watch. I personally can not wait for the season. With that said I would choose Jessica Jones over super girl any day. So if you have not seen Jessica Jones yet I think you should when ever you have the time, but this is my opinion.I want to hear what others will say about my review on which one is better and who is the better superhero right now!

"Supergirl",2016-01-03," I am from India writing this review.World was biased to see men as superheroes. 80-20 ratio male:female in world of marvels, to best of my knowledge. This is new. I have never seen wonder woman, even if i did in my childhood it as animated cartoon... I don't remember. We guys liked Superman, Batman, Ironman etc till recent period.Time is changing. Women Equality is a hot topic in India too... I suppose this series and others such as Quantico (Priyanka Chopra from India as main lead), or Harvey Spector's boss in Suits is a female... Females are getting roles through which women empowerment is being done. Females are not just toys of fashion or attraction but also can handle power when need be!Let me come back to Supergirl series. I have seen all 8 episodes aired till date. I like the work and plots... Yes they are not matching Ironman and Avengers level but we should remember its a TV series and not a movie.All ppl are hardworking, Kara use her boss' tips many times. Writers should improve a bit on chemistry... but then if kids are watching too... intense scenes should be avoided...For me... I am a 25 year old guy who has love for super heroes... This TV series is very relaxing for me. And i wait eagerly for its episodes.Thanks! :-) ","10"
"Supergirl",2016-01-03," I see the MRAs are out in force deriding Supergirl as feminist propaganda. This is FP in the same way the world is a matriarchy because men have to make the first move. Anyone who isn't a teenager in his mother's basement, angry that he's never felt the touch of a woman, would know that just having a woman in the titular role does not make something pro women and Supergirl is definitely not pro women. Superman retains his autonomy. He makes it clear, that his role is to help the world but he is not answerable to anyone. By contrast Supergirl has barely pulled her tights on before she relinquishes all autonomy to the DEO, an organisation she is not part of. She allows some man (whose name I don't care to remember) to berate her constantly for the choices she has made about her coming out, something that is entirely her prerogative and hers alone. So desperate is she to relinquish authority she begins referring to this man as  boss  so that she can feel comfortable knowing there is a man in charge and she's been relieved of all the pesky decision making. Calista Flockhart's character is an 80s power executive cliché who wields authority not by gaining the respect of her subordinates but by threatening them constantly with unemployment. Her management style would garner zero loyalty and trots out the tired stereotype that the only way women can lead is by being super bitches. Writing for Calista is so poor it frequently relies on the old  oh no, Kara's done it, she gone get fired now  only for Calista to say  I like this one, she's got moxy . In a later episode, Supergirl, not content with allowing DEO to call the shots, acquiesces to an Executive Order. Her alter ego is an American, but Supergirl is not, so why exactly is she required to follow an EO? She's not, but because she embodies a cornucopia of poor choices she allows herself to get  chickened  into agreeing to do something. Later, in this same episode, she is being repeatedly blamed for something in classic scapegoating. Ineffectual Supergirl splutters red faced, but is incapable of standing up for herself. Never fear though, boss man is here to save the day and gives her adversary a verbal dressing down. Something, weak, pathetic little Kara can't really manage.. that is until she blows up at her boss because she can say boo to a woman. If there is anymore evidence of how Supergirl is definitely not pro women, Superman battles five Kryptonians and doesn't lose his powers. Supergirl has a five minute showdown with budget Vision and she loses her powers for days. At least in Smallville Kara was shown to be stronger than Clarke. I begrudgingly watched seven episodes before I decided that watching this show was above and beyond the call of duty. I appreciate a lot of the problems with Supergirl are due to the source material (DEO is canon) and female superheroes never work when they're just the female counterpart of a male superhero. This is gender swapped superman. Kara is working in a newspaper office?! (If she's answerable to DEO why isn't she on their payroll?). She has a crush on a man who is crushing on her alter-ego (or would be if this stupid adaptation hadn't made supergirl reveal who she is to everyone of note in the pilot). She disguises her identity by acting clumsy and dorkish with glasses. She speaks to her Kryptonian mother when she needs guidance. The Season Arc villain is shaping up to be a Lex Luthor Light (rich guy whose power is his colossal brain). As huge nerd who is loving Flash and Arrow. I was really hoping DC would continue their trend of killing it in TV. But I guess the inability to write for a female superhero is still a problem in writers' rooms. If you can't write a super heroine with depth go back to feeding the MRAs with an actress with pneumatic boobs who has a talent for placing both her T and A in the shot at all times. At least then someone will be happy. ","1"
"Supergirl",2015-12-31," OK so this one started out a little rough, rushed and much like a kid desperate to get your attention but from episode 4 onward it has come on leaps and bounds! Lets start with Kara....well she's no Felicity Smoak (who if you look up A-dork-able in the dictionary there is a picture of Felicity) but she does a pretty plausible job of being clumsy, awkward, put upon nerd by day and super heroine by night (or day, depending on the nature of the disaster!). It has to be considered a cute and cuddly superhero series, kid friendly to a large degree (If flash is Doctor Who and Arrow is Torchwood, then Supergirl is definitely Sarah Jane Adventures), it's likable and fun! While I totally disagree with Jimmy....sorry James Olson being a buff black dude instead of a nerdy kid, the character dynamic between Kara, James and Winn works really well. The whole secret government agency thing with Hank  I'm not really Hank  Henshaw and Kara's older (and far hotter) adoptive sister Alex, gives that nice support team feel that I'm sure we've gotten used to with superhero series. Whilst I was initially hoping that CBS and The CW could work out their differences so Kara could go to Star City or Central City (or visa versa) to flesh out her universe, I now don't think there's any need, it would still be cool but not the life preserver that I thought this series needed after the first 3 episodes. Try episodes 4 onwards, if you still can't get on with it then it's obviously not for you. ","7"
"Supergirl",2015-12-24," I had a lot of hope for Supergirl. But in short, there are too many insinuations about perceived social injustices, particularly gender issues. Like in the beginning S01E06, where a two male drivers irrationally don't consider the children they were about to run over, and Supergirl gets all the blame for controlling the situation. This is unrealistic in every way imaginable, and it perpetuates the stereotype that men are evil and inconsiderate. In the real world, everyone would have 100% sympathy for her, and probably demand the death penalty for the two men. This show is clearly aimed to please the female demographic, and I can take a hint. I hope it fails miserably. ","2"
"Supergirl",2015-12-21," As others have commented, I truly don't understand the hateful reviews of this show on this site. Those spiteful reviews are truly (ahem) bizarro, and it makes me think that some reviewers here have other agendas that I won't comment on at this time. Suffice it to say that this show is a ton of fun, has great acting, and if you don't take yourself so seriously, a joy to watch. I look forward to watching this show every Monday night. The interplay between sisters is awesome, love how Hank Henshaw's character has developed, love the interactions with Cat Grant. I also happen to love the new take on Jimmy Olsen. I hope to be watching it with my children someday. Thank you to all who are working to continue to bring us this awesome show! ","10"
"Supergirl",2015-12-20," Its like they try to produce a condensed movie every week. Special effects are outstanding, acting is decent. Storyline is improving every week. I think the only thing I would change is the Jimmy Olsen actor. He did a good job playing a pro football player, but does not fit the Jimmy Olsen character at all. But its not like he takes much away from the show. They do a good job with every episode, and it is fun to watch. I like the fact that they stick to the comic book where they can, but also can make good choices on things they add in to the story. The storyline of her pulling a prison ship with her accidentally when her ship landed filled 2 purposes. First it explained her delay in arriving to Earth, stuck in space for 24 years. Second it provides villains that are capable of defeating her. That way a villain does not have to find kryptonite, or they are out of luck. I also like that they can't explain why her ship broke free after so much time, not every mystery needs solved. I was glad it got picked up for a full season, and hope it has a run of several good seasons. ","10"
"Supergirl",2015-12-20," While it started off a little rocky, it has improved immensely. I like the cast, especially the main character. Maybe it doesn't deserve a 10 rating but it certainly doesn't deserve a bunch of 1's, either. I wanted to balance it out a bit. Melissa Benoist is very likable as Supergirl/Kara Danvers. She's cute and charming as Kara and she means business when she dons her cape as a super hero. There are many secrets unveiled along the way as the series unfolds. I just finished watching the eighth episode and can't wait to see what happens in the next one. The show is definitely holding my interest.Give it a chance. You may be surprised and grow to appreciate it like I do. ","10"
"Supergirl",2015-12-18," This show is so feminist it's ridiculous.  You defeated reactron, something superman could never do  even though she's just learning her abilities and he actually saved her. Story is rushed, boom she is super girl, tells her friend immediately, there is no story it's straight to the point. The fighting scenes are mediocre and slow nothing special. Seems like she wants to be a super hero because her cousin super man is one and she want the same appreciation. Then they also make super man say she defeated reactron when he couldn't.... HE'S SUPERMAN WHAT ARE YOU TALKING ABOUT? James is too actractive for the sweet innocent girl super girl is. Dialogue is sooooooooo baddddddd, super girl to superman   thanks for saving my life  Sumer man   just spoke to james won't happen again :-)  are you freaking kidding me? She was clearly going to die but still didn't want the help of super man which it seems like she didn't because he is a man because she was fine with her sister helping her. It all tries to empower women ( in a dumb way) while discrediting men. All men are villains except the ones who worship her. Come on now. We all know super man is better than her don't try that bull crap ","1"
"Supergirl",2015-12-18," Not only is Super Girl cute and sexy. The show is exciting and fun and a must watch For kids and adults. Lots of action and tons of Fighting through out the episode . My son and daughter both love it. I think the writing is good and makes you Want to come back each week for more. The love interest in the show between the characters is interesting too. Super Girl having a sister that is invoked adds to show also. The entire Work place and all the characters is also well done also. So if your not Watching Monday Night Football or if you dvr it and then watch it after Super Girl is over so you can skip the commercials. This is a perfect Show to watch every week it has something for every one. ","10"
"Supergirl",2015-12-17," I thought the last draw for me would had been the ridiculous depiction of Red Tornado resulting in my being done with this garbage. Then I thought, let me give it one last watch.One good thing about the show: (SPOILER ALERT!!!) Although I did have a feeling that bloke was John Jones, when they actually revealed him, WOW<U+0085>he looked amazing! Now If only they could fix the rest of this crap filled with horrible acting and terrible affects we could have a show worth watching.Honestly, I really have a problem with the cast starting with the lead. I guess I was expecting a Justice League or Superman/Batman: Apocalypse Supergirl only to get a badly written 90210 (after High school) corny watered down version of the character with absolutely no substance instead. All of that hype for this CRAP! ","1"
"Supergirl",2015-12-17," So, first up. I have not read the Supergirl comics. Did read some stuff on the internet. Am pretty much caught up on Arrow, Flash, Daredevil, A.o.SHIELD (I know the latter two are Marvel).So the first episode is brilliant in the same way that I loved Eureka and Warehouse 13. It's cheesy, it's corny, it's cliché and has caricature characters. Emotions follow up waaaay to fast (and I really mean, waaaay to fast. Have an emotional family reunion and the first tear has barely dried and she wants to fight). It makes me wanna grab the story, twist in around in my own version. I really like doing that. After that, this level of corniness dwindles down and the quality goes up. Yes, it's not a high quality and there are too many moments that don't add up even when following that universes rules. The amount of times she jumps in her costume when she doesn't need it is remarkably high. Moreover there are many times she speaks of Supergirl like it is a role model and I mean in the ultimate, can't live up to ideal. Or the boss which tries to be strict, bitchy, I-don't-care-bout-you boss, who suddenly takes Kara out for drinks after an outburst. Or how fast a new villain gains powers and immediately masters them in a single hour.However, as episodes go on, it improves. Not fast enough to get to the level where Arrow and Flash are, but well enough to have faith this show will continue to be very enjoyable without the need to rely on super corny over the top parts. Even though they are still in there {WARNING, SPOILERS COMING UP} Like its predecessors in the DC universe. More and more characters become fleshed out. Bad guys become gray or even kinda white (as we learn out that HH is in fact JJ/MM) or gray characters become black (Maxwell as the immoral technocrat). The events in episode 7 are most interesting, especially the part in the DEO basement. Also, miss Grants observance also brings an interesting change, for how long she's been too nice to Kara was starting to get a bit... bothersome. So I'm curious how that's going to flesh out.So, are the flaws gone? No. There are plenty of flaws. Plenty of time problems. For instance a call to Supergirl from the DEO office of a break-in (ep 8) yet DEO arrives first. Or location problems: from a busy first aid center to a deserted street in too short time. Or the continuous need to discuss Supergirl to 'strangers' while in Kara form. It's a bit too... self-centered(?) for Kara tbh. So yeah, it has its flaws, and sometimes they're quirks, sometimes they are a bit annoying. But it's all coated in a sugary sweet honey delight of cute innocence and hope. Especially the latter. Hope is important and from what I've seen so far. It gives me hope for an increasingly better series. ","7"
"Supergirl",2015-12-17," The thing I really like about the show? They are going with a version of Supergirl that isn't perfect. She carries scars due to her planets destruction (which she remembers) and can be emotional, volatile & complicated. Yet she still manages to retain the fun/light and very strong aspects of her character which shine thru. Melissa is doing a awesome job on the Kara front and settling in to the role of Supergirl even better than I anticipated and I had high expectations from the get go.You have to.. Whether the show fails or succeeds the main character cannot be one dimensional as we will all go ho-hum and lose interest. I am certainly not the demographic they may be going for on this show .. but as a member of the demographic that spawned interest in the superhero genre becoming popular I can safely say their getting it right. There are moments that are simply brilliant that make you want to geek out and loop the hell out of the scene. I was NOT expecting that at all. It's impressive simply because it's reactions you only really expect in very rare instances in movies. Their doing so much right with this show that you can ignore it's minor flaws which are really just a process of discovering what works and what doesn't. The shows not corny or campy, It's good TV! ","8"
"Supergirl",2015-12-16," This is based upon the show's own merit alone, not the established Supergirl history in the DC universe, or how Jimmy Olsen isn't Caucasian, dorky, and freckled enough(give it a rest!)The characters and the chemistry of their interactions are not always the strong point, but do progressively become more natural. There are many stereotypes depicted, though based upon many true life and common realities experienced, (i.e. under-appreciated assistants, tyrannical employers, romantically unnoticed best friends,secret government agencies etc.) The best part of this show however is its self-awareness (why Super  girl ? isn't the real problem you?) and being a fantasy/Sci-Fi platform for bringing to the table further discussion of Women. The most under-appreciated half of the species. The exploration of concepts like how to be an independent successful Woman/Female superhero, while trying to remove yourself from the shadow of comparison to a man (Superman) is unparalleled, and extremely relevant in the superhero TV genre.  Just because you wear that symbol on your chest doesn't mean you're him. Fighting him would be an honor. This is exactly what the average Girl, boy and viewers in the U.S.(and beyond) needs, an empowering Female fronted symbolic message for all Girls that shows even with their flaws, constant struggles, and being undervalued or taken less than seriously in a male dominated world (or TV world Arrow, Flash,Gotham)they can in fact make the world a better place, hold their own, and be more as a Girl or Woman than even a superman.I find that the harsh critical response echoes the popular sentiment and even the shows message, how can a show be taken seriously when revolving around a Female superhero, how can Supergirl be taken seriously in its own right if there are successful male fronted shows doing the same thing? The struggles of both Girl and Woman were never more relevant than now! ","9"
"Supergirl",2015-12-16," This is a brilliant superhero show.I have been following comics for all my life and this is the perfect rendition of Supergirl. She is a lighter-weight hero and yet this show has managed to both capture that aspect perfectly and still embrace some deeper themes.Kara struggles to co-exist in the same world as Superman, in the same way as we today struggle to cope with icons like Shakespeare. He appears as just a blur. It's brilliant.The episode where she lost her powers and talks a gunman down could show the NRA madmen a thing or two. That was the most profound moment to come out of USA television that I've seen for a long, long time.The haters seem somehow skewed. I don't know why. Supergirl is meant to be naive and young and a bit like the wildest girlfriend you've ever had. Melissa nails it. This is great TV. I enjoy it as much as Game of Thrones. ","10"
"Supergirl",2015-12-16," I'm mostly writing this review to offset the bad ones all over IMDb that have mostly been written after watching 2 or 3 episodes.I love how this show is done. For once, female characters get to rule and the boys get to sit on the sidelines. After watching Arrow, Flash, Gotham, Agents of SHIELD and Agent Carter with great interest, I can say that only Flash and Agent Carter have held my interest from episode to episode and improved with each.Supergirl started out as corny and a rip off of Superman (pick any movie or TV series) however I enjoy how it keeps the show character driven and is ultimately about Kara's journey. For a girl who was sent off by her mother just as she was turning 13 (the start of some very tough years for both genders), Kara has so much to learn. And you can see that in episodes 1,2,3,4... yes all of them. No matter how much time she's spent here, she's still an alien in the truest sense and unless she's forced to learn something new and evolve, she just seems to exist and float around - not really living.I also like how the show is obviously feminist. They are not trying to hide it. Calista Flockhart as Cat Grant has possibly the best lines on the show and never fails to deliver. Chyler Leigh as Alex is the big sister who shifts from being overly protective to being downright mean at times. But then this is how any 'sister' relationship would be if after 15 years of being an only child you get a super sister. And last of all Laura Benanti in the role of aunt Astra / mom Alura is just brilliant. Their latest showdown in 'Ep 8- Hostile Takeover' was absolute perfection. Fight scenes were well done (yes we could all see there was a hidden agenda), confrontations & flashbacks with both Kara in Krypton & Earth with her aunt and mom were simply spectacular and well acted by both actresses.So whats not to love? You can tell the inner demons, family and workplace drama are enough to drive this show without having Kara fly around National City playing hero.I also like how the writers are staying true to characters created for this TV universe. For all future & past fans of the show, do not expect a comic book reincarnation. I'm glad they are not following any of it because really 90% of any super shows' audience do not read comics. So why not make it your own especially when you know its in its own 'pocket super hero universe' ","9"
"Supergirl",2015-12-15," I previously posted a pretty scathing review of this show on IMDb, but it's a show that got better with the second season and continues to improve. I hated the first season, I honestly think it's garbage. I'd recommend starting off on the second season if you haven't watched it before. I can't remember a TV show that's changed my mind so much in so little time. Credit to the writers, producers, and cast, great job! ","7"
"Supergirl",2015-12-15," You can watch the show, or you can watch paint dry. Both those things would be equally entertaining. The acting is awful, the casting is worse. I understand that it can't be original since it's a reboot of a well known character, but holy poop on a stick, there has to be one original idea somewhere. The very first rescue was of a plane. Wow, just wow. With everything going on, they could have come up with a billion scenarios where a super hero would be useful. They decided to go with a plane. The annoying boss explains to us why calling her super  girl  is nothing to be offended about. No one is, was or will ever be offended by the world girl, when it comes to describing the super girl. Trust me on that.In the world of Dare Devil and even Flash, supergirl won't fly. ","1"
"Supergirl",2015-12-15," After seeing many reviews bashing this series, I was afraid that this series may be discontinued and had to write this review.I am a big fan of superman. And I was not sure of what to expect from this series.When I first saw the pilot episode , I thought this series may not last for more than one season . But I was wrong. Initial couple of episodes were not that good. But then the episodes were getting better and better. I think I am happy with the casting. The episodes did not seem to be dark . They are cheerful, fun and enjoyable. Melissa Benoist did a great job as super girl. Calista Flockhart is fun to watch as Cat Grant. And it is so good to watch how the super girl learns lessons from Flockhart indirectly. Also, I see there is not much violence in the series and hence anybody can watch it. Overall,I liked the episodes. Hope this series will continue :) ","9"
"Supergirl",2015-12-13," This review is written just before the airing of season 1, episode 8. Unlike quite a few other reviewers who trashed this show on the basis of the pilot only, I decided to see how the show and characters progressed. This is basically a reboot of the Supergirl story. The pilot was not the best that I have seen but I must say that it is improving as it goes on. The characters are maturing and the story lines are passable but not great.While reading through previous reviews, I was stunned by some of the very negative comments. Some people criticized the show because it does not follow the historic comic book story lines but they then compare it unfavourably to The Flash and Arrow, neither of which follow the comic books either. So why condemn this show but praise the other 2 ? Considering the original Supergirl was set in the 1950's & 60's it is not surprising that the producers decided to update the whole thing to the current era, after all Jimmy Olson would now be at least 75 years old (a bit old to be a photographer for a modern magazine) and changing him to an African-American is not such a hard thing to come to terms with considering how racist the comic book was (the vast majority of non-Caucasians were villains and nearly all humanoid heroes were Caucasian).I am enjoying this version of Supergirl and was very pleased with the choice of actors for her adoptive parents, great nod to past shows. I even watched Helen Slaters Supergirl movie again. ","7"
"Supergirl",2015-12-09," Let me start by saying I love Melissa Benoist, she is so dam cute, in fact, the only reason I started watching this is because of her in a SuperGirl suit... but... that's about it.The pilot episode was an infernal mess, where do I start...The characters are horrible depicted, they don't have any progression whatsoever and the lines are said like they are reading from a cardboard, they don't act their roles... at all.. this is some serious bad writing/directing in place.The Pilot goes from being an idiot to a super girl to beating a villain to joining a secret organization in just 40 minutes, they tried to crunch so much into so little time that character development went to trash..The second episode didn't improved either, in fact, it made it worse, the only thing bearable from this series is looking at the gorgeous Melissa wearing that hot sexy super girl outfit but, believe me, that's about the only thing you can do on this series, nothing else makes sens, the second episode even have bad editing and camera work, you can clearly see cut scenes where the actors suddenly change positions, even Melissa seems distracted all the time and there are moments when you swear she is looking at the camera !!Horrible miscast, except for Melissa, incredible bad acting, really bad directing and the writer should be fired like... NOW.This is a disaster, I don't think it will finish filming season 1 and I'm sad because I still think Melissa was the cutest Supergirl i've seen but she can't do a series by herself if all the team surrounding her is incompetent.Skip it, or just watch it if you like Melissa and want to see her in a Supergirl suit to fantasize about it because, frankly, there isn't anything more to do here. ","5"
"Supergirl",2015-12-09," I can understand some people complaining about changes like Jimmy Olsen (sp?) being black instead of the original Caucasian, but that isn't a big deal to me, find the show very good, the actress that plays Kara looks awesome, so that always helps, she even makes the nerdy look, look hot.The actors in this show may not be the best, but that doesn't damage the show in my opinion, the show has a lot of potential, just like the Flash and The Arrow and I hope this one keeps going like the other two have.Only time will tell if 'the powers that be' listen with a non-bias position, because most of the criticisms are about the changes to the story, if you can get past that minor detail, the show is totally worth a 9/10 in my opinion. ","9"
"Supergirl",2015-12-09," I'm a fairly open minded person and a bit of a  nerd  when it comes to anything related to superheroes. I must say, I was pretty disappointed when I finished watching the pilot of Supergirl. Childish writing, awful special effects, cable work during fights that reminded me more of a Chinese Martial Arts movie from the 70's than something from this century. The bread and butter of a superhero plot is, usually, the struggle to maintain a  secret identity . Well..... by the end of the first episode, already two peoples knew who Supergirl was, and this was done like it was the easiest thing in the world.... Now... if I'm willing to overlook this, at least, the writers should know that what made shows like  Arrow ,  The Flash  and movies like Dark Knight and Man of Steel so successful, is the maturity of said shows, the darkness that is fully part of the DC universe, but NO.... its clear that this show is meant for teenagers that have little to no knowledge of the DC universe. An example? That Supergirl costume...... really??? After the amazing Superman, Flash, Green Arrow, Deathstroke, Batman (and I could go on) costumes fans got to see already on screen, they came out with something that could be easily found at Wal Mart..... the very concept of  If it's not broken, don't fix it  clearly was not taken in consideration at all. I'm willing to give the show a chance, but some serious changes are needed..... ","2"
"Supergirl",2015-12-08," Although it doesn't really deserve a 10 I rated it high to offset the onslaught of 1 ratings. Others have noted the series started off pretty badly, and I agree, and after the third episode I almost decided to stop watching, but I was surprised by all the episodes since then. Others have commented that it really took off with episode 4. And with 5, 6, and 7 it improved almost exponentially. Although Melissa Benoist had charm from the start, some of the other characters were so caricatured that Benoist's quality performance seemed to get lost. Namely, Calista Flockhart as Cat Grant was so over the top I wondered what the writers were thinking. With the later episodes, however, she develops considerable depth and some of her dialogue is not only well written, but admirably performed by Flockhart. It seems there was a rush to judgment when the series first began by all those who gave it a one star rating. So quick to judge. Have some patience. It gets a lot better. I for one hope it gets renewed because if it keeps improving as it's been doing, it could turn into a hit series. It's the best  Superman -related series ever put on the air, and it's developing a nice, airy, likable tone that will pull you in if you let it. Give it a chance folks. It's not dark like Gotham or Jessica Jones. It's a  different animal.  The Superman/Supergirl universe is a more positive place. Consider what happened after the Christopher Reeve films. They decided to give it a Dark Knight world view and this has been a mistake. It works for characters like Batman and Jessica Jones, but not Superman. This is why I like the Supergirl series. It understands what Superman is all about. ","10"
"Supergirl",2015-12-08," The quality of superhero series is seemingly going down, by each new series that is put out. Where Arrow is kinda quirky, the flash awkward, the super girl is just laughable.The storyline for the start is very questionable, casting is  unprofessional  and there is just one cliché after another. And oh yeah, the cgi is just unbearable for this day and age.So Supergirl was apparently sent to earth to watch over her younger brother Kal-El, but she arrived too late, basically. Why Kal-El would need a protection or guidance of an older sister is beyond me and just not in line with Man of steel saga.So when she eventually arrived on earth, had no  meaning , because Kal-El was all grown up and out in public, known as Man of steel. So she decided that she wanted to  change the world  by getting a job. This makes absolutely no sense to me. She had super powers, with which she could really have an impact on the world, but no, she went and got a job. And lived a normal human life. Now tell me, what idiot wouldn't at least fly around, fight some crime, on daily bases? But she decides to go into being a superhero over night. She has no idea how to fight, she only throws punches. Because who needs to know anything about fighting if they are super strong right? Her speed of flying is also a big mystery, and her  landings  are just bad. She doesn't inspire any belief or confidence that she can fly.And yes, she goes for a journalist of course, nothing new here. The only difference between Supergirl and Kara is, you guessed it, the glasses! And of course no one sees resemblance when they see her standing in front of the poster of the super girl. She even made an interview with her boss as super girl, and didn't try to change voice or anything like that.This show is making everybody in it seem stupid. I haven't seen so unoriginal series in a long time. It screams low budget, amateur and poorly written.You might want NOT to watch it. ","2"
"Supergirl",2015-12-08," The actor who played Jimmy Olsen has no chemistry whatsoever with Supergirl. Forget the fact, that they made Jimmy Olsen a black dude and changed the storyline, but they had to get someone who couldn't act. If they wanted to add an African American in the show they could've have added another character instead. Why make Jimmy Olsen black, why not Philipino or Mexican? They took too much liberty in changing the story line. They should have instead added to the storyline instead of changing it. For example, Hank Henshaw was a good addition to the show and the actor who played him does a very good job. But every time there's a scene with Supergirl and Jimmy Olsen, all you really see is awkwardness. ","1"
"Supergirl",2015-12-07," I will start by admitting I am a Marvel fan. with that out of the system, I will now elaborate on a few things that bothered me when I watched the show. I will start with the terrible character development flaws. maybe it's because the production had to do a convincing pilot, but everything in the first episode happened too fast. I didn't get to know Kara as a total nerd before she suddenly became a superhero, the show also never introduced Alex as a normal person, so there goes my  surprise  for her being a secret agent. the forced romantic triangle didn't really add anything to the equation. and the bad overacting from about... everyone except Calista Flockhart is the real Deal breaker for me. the  one episode plot  is also something I don't really like in this show but I guess it's an audience thing. I tried giving this show more chances, but the relative ease with which Supergirl deals with older, experienced fighters that are as strong or stronger then her is just unbearable. I really wanted to like this show, I do watch regularly and enjoy Arrow and The Flash, but the CBS really did a terrible job with this show, and instead of focusing on Kara's frustration from spending her years as a girl scout and giving her an interesting dark side, the CBS chose to make her the perfect hero, which as boring as a superhero show could get. ","3"
"Supergirl",2015-12-06," Arguments about any  feminist  agenda aside, my problem (and my family's) is that the show is very poorly written and produced.Action sequences are lame, relationships are absolutely pubescent, characterization is poor, and on and on.The effects in combat scenes are poorly done. Worse, the action is ridiculous. Case in point #1: two people using  laser vision  against each other. The strike in the middle as if they were quarterstaves, and when they move the rays are deflected upward to strike a beam. Light doesn't work like that; if two lasers (or flashlights!) are pointed at each other, the light passes through the opposing beam and strikes whatever it's aimed at. Case #2: Supergirl gets struck in the chest by another bean and is blasted backward like a shot, but ripping off a car door and holding it in front of herself completely stops the same beam. There are far too many other examples to list.Kara is what, in her late 20s? She acts like she has a 12-year-old's crush on one guy, giggling stupidly and looking awkwardly, while completely missing the signs of another potential paramour. She is completely cowed by her boss (ok, maybe I can let that one go), but should be far more self-assured considering the show's constant feminist leanings. She has lived 15 or more years on Earth already; she should be past that stage in her life.Supergirl doesn't ever let go in combat even when she's literally being killed. She KNOWS she has the same abilities as her cousin, but at one point he has to show up and simply stands before her attacker and ignores the same attack that is killing Kara. How many times must she suffer badly at a bad guy's hands before she thinks  Hey, I'm being killed, perhaps I should hit back hard?  And really... the whole glasses/no glasses  secret identity  is as stupid as it ever was. I mean, anyone who has ever seen her up close (like her boss, duh) in both guises can clearly see the little indent above her left eye, not to mention the smile, the face, etc. To quote a scene from Lois and Clark years ago, it's just  galactically stupid.  There are so many plot holes and failures in general that after 5 episodes, my family has chosen not to watch any more. It's a shame, because we REALLY wanted this show to be good, at least on the level of Flash. The Supergirl/Kara character has just as rich a story (in the comics) as Superman, but this show is failing her in a big way. ","3"
"Supergirl",2015-12-05," I am thrilled that I now have a weekly date with my nine year old daughters to see Supergirl. As a parent, it becomes hard to find TV shows where you can share some fun time with your children.The impact is wonderful, just as I did as a kid, they spend their recess playing Supergirl. Each of their friends is either a heroine, or villianess, and they cannot wait for the next week to pass so they can see the next episode.I have seen all of the Superman shows, starting with the old Black and Whites, through Lois & Clark, Smallville, the comics, and all the movies. This show is just as fun, and fresh, since Supergirl is not as perfect as those other shows. She gets beat up, hurt, cries, and comes back! Is it so bad to have a nice, strong, female role model? Keep on flying Supergirl! I hope we see you for a long time ","10"
"Supergirl",2015-12-04," I really wanted to like this show because I generally love/like the superhero genre. The cast stand-outs are pretty-much Melissa Benoist and Jeremy Jordan and on their shoulders and with better writing this show might have attained it's potential. Such a shame! Anyhoo, I find myself fast-forwarding through any of the scenes with Calista Flockhart, I think with good writing and direction she can do well, but her performance in this is so flat and idiosyncratic (In a NOT good way!) that it is just about unbearable for me. I can imagine very young viewers enjoying it greatly and perhaps if they changed the time- slot to early morning cartoon time it would sit more comfortably. You can have one or two actors with charm, but unless you bounce them around in interesting situations and with other interesting characters, it isn't enough to save a sinking show. I have wondered what it requires to be 'saved', perhaps the death of CF's character, increasing the relationship dynamics between the two charmers (Benoist and Jordan) also using the 'race against time' device a little more and with greater deftness - as she is indestructible so the drama must be milked out of the vulnerability of those around her. Perhaps it is they are trying to appeal to both an adult and an extremely young audience so they never put any real meat on the bones? A pretty tricky situation for this show I think... ALSO - whoever did the music should either be schooled hard or sacked! Sheesh! ADDITIONAL: Now the show has changed hands I have noticed some definite improvements so I will increase my star rating from 1 star ... also, every time they include Martian Manhunter the whole show lifts a few notches - the actor is just so darned likable as is the double-sided character he plays. Hooray for TV shows that eventually get their shizz together! (o: ","4"
"Supergirl",2015-12-03," Please keep in mind that this review is from someone that grew up with George Reeves as Superman when I reference my comparisons. Super girl is a  dramady  in the best sense of the word. Before the season started, I wondered how they were going to do a show without it being just a rehash of former Superman, Superboy, etc., shows. But by giving her ordinary human qualities the writers and producers have created a character that is much more 3 dimensional than any of the past shows and movies. She can be a klutz, she has a temper, she makes all kinds of mistakes in judgment, she hasn't yet learned how to handle all of her powers and much more. And the real kicker is her human stepsister worker for the secret agency that manages and controls her and other aliens, good as well as bad. The other fun character is the head of the company  Kara  works for, as played by Calista Flockhart. Reminds me a lot of Perry White, except female, thin, and younger. Fascinating how this show and Gotham can be so different in form and style and yet both be so entertaining ","8"
"Supergirl",2015-12-03," I've suffered through the first 5 or so episodes of this series mostly because i was board.It seems like the plot was written for a 10 year old girl, not well thought out. In a nut shell - constant feminist theme, overcome adversity, blahh blahh blahh, good guys always win if they try really really hard, no real twists or suspense, predictable story lines, and the characters don't match the tried and true superman storyline.Im all for mixing up an old story but the writers killed off several of the traditional suspenseful parts of the superman story in the first episode. Aspects of the story that really helped make it what it was.Super girl is cute at least but all of the writers attempts to add romance into the story line fail terribly.If they want this show to air on more than the Disney channel i would seriously hope they kill off some main charters, add some heart break, and start over to try to save what little plot they have managed to build.Please make the fight scenes at least a little more realistic...i mean i understand its  super  powers and all but a little realism in how people in these situations would actually fight would be nice. I mean they can have their powers and all but it would be nice if they didn't fight like a 3rd grade slug fest.Also writers...who never seem to understand this...IF YOUR GOING TO TRY TO USE REAL SCIENTIFIC TERMS AND UNITS HIRE SOMEONE TO HELP THAT ACTUALLY UNDERSTANDS WHAT THEIR TALKING ABOUT. Seriously a multi- million television project and they cant fact check their script. The watered down physics class at your fine arts college doesn't mean your an expert. Either get it right or don't try at all, or at the very least f****** google it before you embarrass yourselves on nation television...Wikipedia is free for gods sake. Im an engineer so i may be a little wiser on those things than most but nothing is more annoying than people trying to sound smart and failing. Spend .0001% of your budget and hire someone to help you fix your terrible science fiction. ","3"
"Supergirl",2015-12-01," am not gonna write essays, i'll just keep it simple fight scenes- terrible, she's not threatening at all and the fights are badly co-ordinated, don't get me started on the CGIfeminism- i get that this show represents feminism, but there's a subtle way to do it, the lines  why is it always men with road rage  and  because/especially if you're a girl  and many others are just forced and un-called for. Jessica Jones knows how to do their feminist agenda stuff without making it cringe-worthy-this is coming from a DC fan-boycostume- i actually don't mind itcast- am sorry but her boss, the blonde lady is probably the shittiest character ever put on TV ","3"
"Supergirl",2015-11-30," Plot and action was decent, but Melissa Benoist is not nearly blonde enough to be playing supergirl. I'm glad it was picked up for a full season. Hopefully that gives them enough time to gradually dye her hair more blonde to fit the character.And I have no idea why the director had Chyler Leigh cut her hair short for the role. Pretty sure this is also an inaccurate depiction of the character. I get that the director wants to put his own spin on things, but do that in the actual story line (which by the way, obviously needs more attention paid to) and not the character details. Swaying away from original character designs does nothing for the comic fans.Honestly, I just googled Alex Danvers dc comics and the first pictures from Pinterest of all places had better character designs.Also, after seeing the success for Arrow and Flash, the cg animations were pretty disappointing for this show. ","5"
"Supergirl",2015-11-30," I really wanted this show to succeed or at least I wished that it entertains people that it could go on for few seasons.But no way it's going to see season 2 or 3.- Acting is extremely awful. Especially supergirl. - Script is much worse than my expectations. OK I did not ask for a masterpiece but this is an insult to audience. They exploit the archenemy in episode 1 and she beats her in episode 2 and then struggles with her boss, her boss's kid, her mom, her love for the rest of the show. So how does it differ from a Brazilian soap opera?There is no fun no entertainment no action no excitement no of anything. Unfortunately one of the worst super heroine show of all time.Writers must be replaced to save the show. Hope it's not too late. ","3"
"Supergirl",2015-11-28," I don't get the hate. It has it's flaws, ie. The first few episodes were a tad rushed, but it's getting great. Hell, even Game of Thrones was awful until the third or fourth episode, then that became one of the greatest shows ever. I'm not saying this is an award winner, but it does its job now, and is entertaining stuff.The acting is on par with Arrow, probably better, and the story lines and look have a similar tone to Flash. It's not a smart show, no complicated plot that requires a whole season to understand, i admit. It is a monster of the week show, and it's refreshing to see that. It also has lots of explosions, and action in every episode. And the Kara issues, even though i'm a guy, i'm relating to. The drama in the background is done very well. Maybe you have to relate to it to appreciate it? I don't know. But some of the characters are going through similar situations to what i'm going through in life at the moment, and reactions are how i'd react. So i can't knock the acting or the dialogue. It's spot on for me. Winn is pretty much me in real life too, so hats off to getting that bang on.As for the look. I get the feeling they were gunning for a similar tone and feel as The New Adventures of Superman, in terms of dialogue, focus, and target market. I think they nailed that. It's obviously for the whole family; not dark, no steamy scenes. The CG is fine. not as bad as many make out on here. It's better than the CG in Dr Who, and in Primeval, and The Matrix for that matter. Enough of that though. It is simple show, comical at times, and has its flaws. But it is entertaining. I think people look past that in TV and film sometimes; look too deep. You don't need to. ","9"
"Supergirl",2015-11-26," I write this knowing full well this show was not made for someone my age, and I've only seen the first episode. I won't go into the plot, or lack thereof, I just want to ask why I'm reminded of William Shatner when I watch the fightscenes. Come on, she's supposed to be a superhero, but her fists travel at the speed of smell and she moves like her joints don't work properly. At least some of the budget of a superhero show should be spent on fightchoreography. The cgi also needs a drastic upgrade, because what was shown in this episode was not good. I know that this might have been fixed in later episodes, but I doubt it. ","3"
"Supergirl",2015-11-25," Not sure what demographic they were shooting for, but they missed it. I wouldn't let me little girl watch this in a million years, and I'm not sure who would ever. Not sure why Hollywood is going down this road. Oh wait, yeah I do. I love how they think no one knows what they're doing. You can brainwash people all you want, but everyone knows better. There's only one thing I've heard everyone except those in your industry say and that's how much garbage you put in front of us. We know you hate us and that you're trying to wipe us off the face of the planet, but you're only hurting yourselves Hollywood. Keep this up and in a couple decades there won't be anyone to disappoint. There also won't be anyone to sell tickets to because we'll be living in a third world country. ","1"
"Supergirl",2015-11-24," The pilot was a bit too predictable, cliché, quite busy and overdone. After that you are in for a pretty cool ride. Keeping the wit and action balanced as in the old classic cartoons, this series reminds me of the days where TV was entertaining yet innocent. For me I have learned that it takes three episodes to even consider giving a series my opinion. Its like meeting new people, some people give good first impressions then later on, their true colors come out. Others seem conceited but end up being the best of people. TV shows are a lot like personalities since people wrote the shows, after all. And as a viewer i feel it coming through the screen touching my heart. This show is that dorky little girl with glasses who seems kind of silly, but ends up being gorgeous, witty and smart. I also like the whole innocence of it, like the old classic superman TV show. ","9"
"Supergirl",2015-11-16," Don't know a thing about Supergirl comics, I just love good sci-fi and was excited to see this new series.Watched the first episode and couldn't believe how bad it was. The acting, the script writing, the hopelessly pathetic  super hero , the instant caving into bad press, the instant bad press generated by a jaded? public (how could the public be that quick to judge?)That it's based roughly on the Superman story of her being affiliated with a news agency in a lowly position is OK, not super original, but as long as the actors and script writing makes it interesting, so what. But for her to be so groveling and with such stupid / ridiculous scenes coming from the scriptwriters is not acceptable. I don't think its a spoiler to say she's up against criminals from her home world from the very first episode. So not only is there little to no development as she's growing up and into her powers (she doesn't even use them for cripes sake in her formative years), she has zero self-confidence and once she does bust loose with her powers to help others, she's pitted against the strongest, most evil adversaries imaginable, and a public that is passé on super heroes and are super critical of her from day one.My favorite superhero stories give you background as to who they are as a person and what they're willing to do to seek their revenge / help others / have a moral conscience / etc. Here, nothing. If you identify with someone who isn't self confident but ultimately has value, then you might think I'm being too hard, and as a guy you might think I can't relate to what a young girl would be going through. But I'm sorry, there's little to no character development here, its like we're plunged right into the 3d season of a B movie quality TV series from the 80s or something. I watch mostly movies and TV series of the last 15-20 years because of how amazingly good acting, scriptwriting, production values have gotten. Not so with this bomb, I wanted to give it a second chance, and did watch the 2d episode only to find myself going over and over again,  Wow, this has got to be the worst scriptwriting I've seen In forever , and while the acting is not great, I mostly blame the scriptwriters and producers for such a lame concept of how to draw an audience into a story of a female equivalent of Superman. Don't waste your time, judging by the D- to F quality of the story so far, I'm sure it'll continue to disappoint. ","1"
"Supergirl",2015-11-16," to be honest: i didn't expect much. but sometimes a lame comic story can transform into something special (see  men in black ) ... unfortunately not this time.  supergirl  is - no offense! - one of my most boring and dull TV-series experiences i remember so far. the visual effects are behind their time (even  the flash  has better CGI and surface mapping), the story (girl should help little brother - has a space-accident - arrives with delay - in the meantime brother has become SUPER-man - SUPER-man helps lost little sister - little sister imitates (now) big brother including being a no-name reporter - little sister is fumbling with her responsibility and does many things wrong etc.) - is of an extremely offending sexist undertone (despite - or maybe just because of - all the wannabe-feminist-gags) and maybe worst of all: cosmetic-surgery- and botox-victim calista flockhart, posing (not acting) as the female pendant to perry white (and so an imitation of a man, too, of course). but maybe i am wrong. maybe i should wait until episode S06E03 or so to see the transformation into a pro-female, pro-women's rights, counter patriarch-ism-TV-show with interesting characters and excellent actors. but, honestly, i doubt it's worth trying. it hurts too much to see over 100 years of female emancipation progress flushed down the toilet of a conservative studio back-room.i seriously pity the basically sympathetic but poor girl who acts as the miniskirt-super-girlie in this embarrassing TV-show, because it will be very hard for her to get some decent job after this role.

"Supergirl",2015-11-13," I don't know, maybe it's me. There are a lot of people who gave this show good reviews. Did I miss something? What are they seeing that I'm not? There are just too many inconsistencies here. An example--episode 3 has this guy Reactron (???) who is human and whose ''power'' is some kind of nuclear blast generated from a suit. Now if I understand correctly, this guy fought Superman to a standstill and got away? Sorry, I don't buy it and any Super family fan won't either. We're talking about a man who fought a bunch of Kryptonians with the same powers as he has and won and we're being told that Reactron all but beat Superman and got away? What are the writers smoking??? Now,if you're looking for more strange behaviour look again at episode 3. Reactron is roasting Supergirl, Superman shows up, does nothing about Reactron but brings Kara home and leaves! Oh, sure, the writers try to justify this with an erupting volcano somewhere but it just sounds hollow and false. If I saw my cousin being beat up I'd surely want to defend her, wouldn't you? Only logical, but here Superman just leaves and does nothing about it. There are many other things that grate on my nerves with this program but the worst one is the Cat Grant character. Somebody do something about her please, i can't stand her anymore!!!!! Well, that's it for me. I'll give it one more try. If I don't see any improvement by next episode I'm outta here. There's better writing and acting in the Saturday morning cartoons. I had such hopes for this show. I really wanted it to work. Sob.... ","1"
"Supergirl",2015-11-13," I loved it, because a 'female' super person is a fresh idea and I was glued to TV all hour, pay no attention to bad/silly review, I smell jealousy ;)\To those bashing this for having a 'bad' script , did you expect DEEP plots, along the lines of the previous incarnation of super man, well if so that's unfair to this attempt with a different protagonist.I looked at this with a objective mind, not one that ridicules 'new' things or has excessive requirements just because its a been there done that series.If I feel entertained, enjoyed the effects and didn't yawn on the acting or characters/plot , then I'm good.I thought the characters were believable, villains as villainous as usual and I'm sure this will be as good or better than anything put forward so far.Highly recommended.

My mother said to me- 'Don't ever smoke. Please don't put your family through what your Grandfather put us through.  I agreed. At 28, I have never touched a cigarette.

"Supergirl",2015-11-12," The show is so bad even IMDb's description belittles it.  The adventures of Superman's cousin in her own superhero career.  Why not something like,  The girl from Krypton is ready for action, as she ventures forth discovering her purpose while facing adversaries  . With all the changes to the story origin and characters I was expecting something better than and 1960's version of Superman. The dialogues are cheesy. The thought processes of Supergirl, who should be as smart as Superman, if not smarter as she actually had some Kryptonian education is unbelievable poor. Superman would take a beating and then bounce back but at least his efforts where heartfelt. The lackluster approach of this heroine leaves much to be desired. Simply put, how can she be living on earth for all this time and not be the number one fan of her 'cousin', the sole surviving member of her planet (to her knowledge). the story is trying to incorporate real world events but excludes the technology. If superman were real, there would be youtube videos and tweets and all manner of digital information that she could use as a database for reference. She should know his villains and how they were defeated. The story could have been written in a much better way. The reluctance for her to take up the mantle of Supergirl should have ended in a more traumatic way. The villains also need to be smarter and better coordinated. I don't know who to blame more, director, actors, writers, screenplay, cgi. This show needs a complete overhaul. ","3"
"Supergirl",2015-11-12," I love Melissa Benoist. Too bad the storyline of Supergirl is derivative (Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D. anyone?) and boring (any chick-flick you ever saw). The writing is weak -- the characters are cardboard stereotypes (especially Calista Flockhart's) and the dialogue is banal. Why is Jimmy (er, James) Olsen even in this show? And David Harewood is basically reprising his role from Homeland. I would rather see truth, justice, and the American way at the center of this show (enough with alien invaders already) and a lot less romantic claptrap -- Lois and Clark pushed that envelope as far as it can reasonably go. I watch to see the girl. I wonder how long that will be enough. ","6"
"Supergirl",2015-11-11," I watched 2 and a half episodes. Could not take the dialogue or the action scenes anymore. If you are an eight year old girl living in the 1950's (or a 13 year old boy going through puberty, Supergirl is OK looking) the show might interest you. I have to write more lines so this review will post. Blah, Blah, show sucks, Blah, Blah, show sucks, Blah, Blah, Supergirl should wear a bikini, Blah, Blah, show sucks, Blah, Blah, Flockhart had a face lift, Blah, Blah.

"Supergirl",2015-11-05," In a nutshell...This show is just not worth watching. I am wondering who was drunk enough to accept this show onto the air. I watched the first 2 episodes and disliked them very much. The background story of how Supergirl comes into existence on Earth is just CHEAP. The dialogues are pseudo-heroic, the acting is less than mediocre and the plot holes and illogical/unfounded actions are unsuccessfully whitewashed with unimpressive special effects. Even the music is bad...--> BAD SHOW! Don't waste your time watching this show. It will be canceled soon enough ","1"

"Supergirl",2015-11-04," After hearing about a new superhero series coming out I got really excited because I am such a fantasy world/ super hero fan, despite the fact that it was super girl who isn't one of my favourite Heros out there. I watched the first episode and wasn't blown away as much as I thought I would be. Firstly the fact they made a series about one of the lower class heros in my opinion doesn't bring much popularity to the series in the first place. Super girl is just super girl. She's not one of the popular ones sorry to say. I think Wonder Woman would have blown people away. More people would flock to that show and I believe ratings would be much higher of the show was done correctly. Much better choice in my eyes. But I found the show to be kind of geeky and boring. Super girl is very silly and childish I feel in the show, she doesn't portray a strong female superhero character people will look up to. She resembles a lost little girl stumbling her way through life and I'm not finding the show exciting at all. Halfway through episode 2 and I had to turn it off cause it did not grasp my interest. And I don't feel like I will continue to watch. 2/10 for me ","2"
"Supergirl",2015-11-04," Melissa Benoist was an excellent choice to play Supergirl. She has to be played as an innocent goody two-shoes, and it's all too easy to err on the side of slightly simpering and pathetic like Toby McGuire's Spiderman. (Sometimes he came across as so wimpy I just wanted to smack him.) Calista Flockhart's Cat Grant provides an excellent foil for Kara and Chyler Leigh is terrific as always I especially like Mehcad Brooks as an updated Jimmy Olsen. The purists, predictably, are wailing and rending their garments at everything about him from leaving Metropolis to not being a freckled ginger or a brainless goof ball. I think it was an excellent creative decision using him as sort of a stand-in for Superman, thereby avoiding the danger of her being upstaged by the more familiar character.These sorts of creative liberties and deviation from  cannon  are essential in a franchise that's over 50 years old. I'm looking forward to lots more  Supergirl . ","10"
"Supergirl",2015-11-03," This show has been created for the consumption of lonely, young girls and adults with an IQ of around 70. If you like this show and it gets canceled then DON'T DESPAIR - The Disney Channel will pick it up!The good: The lead is attractive and has a killer body that looks great in a little red skirt.The bad: Everything else.Flockhart is particularly embarrassing as a supposedly domineering boss and the photographer Jimmy Olson has now morphed into 'James', a middle aged black dude!One of the clerks at the newspaper can magic bullet proof capes out of thin air and hack right in to the police databases which is handy... because this super hero can't do a bloody thing for herself.Oh, and every man in the show is evil, even the good guys... except the one or two that worship Supergirl!This is a very painful experience for anyone with a brain cell in their heads - you've been warned!

"Supergirl",2015-11-03," Trash. Unwatchable. I had to force myself to watch this to the end.* Bad acting (of the lead actress and of others). * Bad dress (looks like a cheap Halloween dress, moreover it's different from the comics). * They push SJW propaganda hard, they literally mentioned the word  anti-feminism  and implied that it's something bad. Women are portrayed as strong and powerful, men are evil or irrelevant (and lot of other SJW talking points in every second scene). * Terrible dialogs, cheap wisdom ( Be wise. And always be true to yourself. ) Pathetic. * Cheap looking SFX. * Amateurish fist fighting. * Idiotic ending of her fight with a villain. WTF?It's obviously for feminists and not for men. Please note how big the voting gender gap is at IMDb. ","1"
"Supergirl",2015-11-03," Much like previous shows such as Arrow or Smallville, the beginning of this show seems weak with poor chemistry between the main cast. The writing itself is really well done and the acting is better than most shows, however there isn't chemistry between characters and that makes it cringe-worthy. The special effects and CGI are good and bad. The flying sequences also make you cringe but other than that they are almost as good as those on The Flash. A lot of the fight sequences which occur at night remind me of Arrow which is a good thing and seeing as both shows have the same executive producer it means better things in the future. I also believe that over time chemistry will improve. As for the actual story it is very promising and the execution will also improve. ","7"
"Supergirl",2015-11-03," This show has potential....Sorry had potential but whomever did the casting for this show was either given a very low budget or is a rookie at their job. Melissa Benoist was terrible in Glee and not well liked by viewers at all. I can guarantee you they still think her 'acting' sucks and that she should perhaps pursue another career. I just could not finish a whole episode staring at her face again. Watching Glee with her in it was painful enough.This show would of been perfect for a new actress to make her mark. Someone who is eager and can actually act. I am pretty sure this show will only last this season so I am not even going to bother watching more episodes. Too bad as I really would of liked a show where the female is the hero for once. That would be something little girls could of looked up to instead of that Frozen movie but alas Let it Go! will win the day again. ","3"
"Supergirl",2015-11-03," Like a couple of other reviewers, I have actually signed up purely to give some balance. Balance that I believe in! This show has had a slow start, but wow it's starting to come good. People calling it a pro-feminist show need to get there heads out of there rear ends! Just because there is 4 of the main characters as women, does not make it a feminist show. The shows actual style is starting to make it a fun enjoyable, family friendly, yet fairly easy watching show. If your looking for another marvel daredevil style show (a great show btw) then you are sadly mistaken!This show is a bit like the  Man of steel's  attempt to take flight and eventually take flight. Me not being a comic book fanatic, has allowed me too watch this show without having a premeditated opinion. Like the Flash and Arrow, this show has started slowly, but the pilot episode I thought was very intriguing. Plenty of action, yes some cringe worthy scenes, but overall well made. It appears to be coping a lot of hate for not actually doing much wrong. The idea that we need to realise is that the shows and films these days are no longer designed to appeal just too the comic lovers but rather to a wider audience. When I heard this show was coming out I didn't think id give it a go, I would write it off, but now having watched the first 2 episodes it is slowly but surely managing to reel me in, a bit like arrow, which lots of critics and people said was awful. Open mind people that's all that's needed. This show as i said is like the attempts to take flight. It is jumping around, smashing into things, but after the second episode, I think it's managed to take flight, and has started too reveal itself as a great show. 8/10 and a recommend if your after a fun enjoyable, show, that is easy watching!

"Supergirl",2015-11-03," Actually this is one of best TV shows in this era,people are so jealousy about her as I guess.Melissa is Ideal character for the show,she is beautiful,hot and talented,I suggest that let the show on going,enjoy it,It's a TV show,don't expect real life scenarios in TV shows,Major Issues - I got attract from very 1st episode, someone read comics and compared it with the show, why people can't change the scenarios in the comic, why it must stick with the comic book? grow up people.people. Smallville ran 10 seasons,you guys watched it without complaining,after the 5th season it was horrible,but they carried the show to 10 seasons,I'm not expecting same thing from super girl,but I'm saying that if someone put a bad review then don't follow him eagerly,knock your brain,watch it,then decide.don't judge anything by looking at other one. cheers!

"Supergirl",2015-10-31," Diversity is good but Jimmy Olsen has red hair and freckles, for God's sake! He's not a tall Black basketball player! Also, too many people know who she is! It's not much of a secret! Special effects look pretty good and  Supergirl  certainly looks the part. Wrong hair color! She should be a blond, not strawberry-blonde! Good casting! The violence is a bit intense. A villain's death in the pilot was unnecessary, in my opinion, even if it is a Krypton alien. Some good touches: A man is stronger than a girl even on Krypton and although  invulnerable  by Earth standards, not totally so against fellow aliens. Please don't turn this into another  Buffy  series, please! Future episodes will tell. Even  Smallville  was bad for a while with it's  monster of the week  concept. The airplane rescue scene was fabulous and so were Dean Cain and Helen Slater as her Earth parents.  Allie Mcbeal  is the perfect  foil  as Kara's overbearing boss. We shall see about the rest. Superman should show up from time-to-time too. Who will play him? ","8"
"Supergirl",2015-10-31," I'm aware that I initially gave lukewarm reviews first-up to now established favourites of mine  Arrow ,  The Flash  and  Gotham  from the expanding DC TV universe, so I'm wary of taking too much from first impressions. I do think though that putting a fully super-powered character into a TV series is a harder sell than a no-power or single-power character, due to the former's sheer omnipotence, plus of course we know what familiarity breeds, i.e. when you've seen one red and blue-garbed super-hero who can fly, be strong, invulnerable, etc., etc,...At least this pilot episode gets the origin story out of the way quickly, again perhaps because it so closely resembles her big cousin's, quickly growing up Kara Danvers to adult or at least early adult-hood and putting her in a similar job to Clark Kent's (and Peter Parker's come to that) on a newspaper. Jimmy, sorry James Olsen gets a PC makeover a la Iris Allen in  The Flash  as well as obviously migrating to Metropolis to keep an eye on the emergent heroine as well as boost character recognition for the keen viewer. We're also quickly introduced to the Phantom Zone villains who will no doubt form the continuity theme for the series, whilst new characters such as her super agent stepsister, her Diggle-type boss plus a kooky love interest boyfriend (Cisco, anyone?), look like they'll form the back-up team, again just like Arrow and The Flash. The biggest drawback is undoubtedly going to be the awful Calista Flockhart who must have watched the  Confessions Of A Shopaholic  movie, and only that, a hundred times to research her part as Kara's female J Jonah Jameson-type newspaper editor. I doubt even Supergirl's super-strength could force a perceptible emotion out of her Botox-straightened features.The special effects were okay, but the few attempts at humour fell fairly flat. The acting was just so-so too and I'm struggling to pick up either any cuteness or personality in Melissa Benoist as the title character and fear she may go the way of Helen Slater, who by the way, it was nice to see in a cameo role as the mother of the character she herself played in the ill-fated movie years ago (repeating a neat casting trick employed in  The Flash  with Barry Allen's father).I do hope it improves but unlike  Arrow ,  Gotham  or even  The Flash , I can't see much opportunity for some dramatic weight to the story-lines to come. I'd like to be proved wrong even as I appreciate the show may perhaps be reaching out to a younger, possibly more female-based audience than the three other shows I've mentioned, but I still think that this particular series may struggle to stay up in the air, unlike the Supergirl character herself. ","4"
"Supergirl",2015-10-31," A mixed start, perhaps because setting up characters in a pilot is a tricky process. Melissa Benoist lead has a bright enough personality for the part and the storyline has an interesting feminine approach. Perhaps turning the Superman story upside down was not the best move as an outline but it does paint a picture as to how things may develop.Measured against other mainstream teen appeal TV is faces big competition and the reality of competition is that it really has to score points very early on in a series to catch the audience. It's glossy and up to date, runs quite smoothly and quickly action wise, is well produced but I wonder if it will catch on. Too early on to predict after the pilot but I wish it well. I'll watch it again and that doesn't happen with all series.Recommended to sample. ","6"
"Supergirl",2015-10-31," Personally it feels like the role of Supergirl was given to a high school cheerleader. Totally destroys the girl you picture when you hear the name Supergirl. Where is the strong willed girl who lost her entire world and was tasked with protecting her cousin Kal'El. I just don't see it! And what is with the new story twist? She has a sister named Alex Danvers. Who are the Denvers, what happened with the Kents and why would Superman keep his cousin in the care of another family?! She has another cousin other then Superman! Where exactly did they dig this story from?! More like what universe! Supergirl depicted here is nothing like the girl in the Kents house we all know and love. ","5"
"Supergirl",2015-10-30," Any time there is something new, a re-imagining, if you will, there will always be those who say that it's not worth it. This is what I feel is really going on here.In my view, the main reason so many people are hating Supergirl is because they're used to having the title character grow up in Superman's shadow. She'd always been  Superman's cousin,  never really given her own way to grow up into the character.Sure, having her stuck in the phantom zone was a bit of a stretch, but going with the continuity of having her grow up, basically, on Earth as a younger cousin, because, as it says in the pilot, time doesn't pass in the PZ, gives her something that no other Supergirl had before.Before, she was always someone who followed in Superman's shadow, someone who was just thought of as a female Superman. Now, Supergirl is her own character, written in such a way that she's growing into who she is supposed to be. She is a full hero in her own right, not just a girl who's like Superman.As per her connection to James Olson, there is no reason at all that she and James can't have that kind of relationship. It shouldn't matter at all, for any reason, that James can be in the story in the way he is.If you're looking for a female Superman, or if you're saying that it can't be good if it doesn't follow one of the  established story lines,  then you will be disappointed. But, if you want to see a story of a female superhero who is growing into herself, learning about what she can do while facing the same fears and doubts that every woman feels at some time in their lives, and wondering who she really is, just like every person has ever felt, someone who definitely isn't Superman but can exist without his influence, then this show might be worth the watch. ","10"
"Supergirl",2015-10-30," I tried watching the pilot episode last week but I could not make it through all the way. Cringe-worthy acting. Boring plot. Stupid premise. Supergirl, Superman's cousin (I think), apparently needs the help of a group of tech-savvy humans just to make it through the day, let alone defeat the bad guys. Huh?????If this show does not drastically improve in every area, including premise (which will be hard to do, seeing how premise has already been established), it will not last a full season. The only reason I did not give it a 1 out of 10 is because I still have actually seen worse. Do not waste your time. ","2"
"Supergirl",2015-10-30," big smelly pile of horse 's height and thicker ...Melissa Benoist aka  super girl  has a huge crater in her forehead as a reminder of childhood chickenpox. No super girl would ever have that, unless the series was cast by a complete imbecile. This series was a complete waste of time with little potential.And who would ever cast Ally McBeal in anything again is beyond me. She made her dough through the late nineties. No need to bring  that  back again, am I right? Again addressing my complaint to the caster.With such a high budget, one would expect a whole lot more from the chosen actors. ","1"
"Supergirl",2015-10-30," In the last couple of years I have seemed to have gotten bored with TV series. I miss House and The Mentalist. To catch my attention, a series has to be considerably better than average. For a few minutes I thought Supergirl might be that series. Maybe it will be, but after the pilot, I sincerely doubt it. I like the Supergirl character well enough. I wouldn't have gotten by the first commercial if she had been macho. In fact, I like all of the main characters. Unfortunately I released an audible groan when it became apparent that Supergirl would be fighting an alien super villain. That has been done before. If the super villain were interesting, if he had a silly sense of humor, for example, then it could still work. Sadly, the pilot's super villain is garden variety and therefore boring. He growls like the standard bad guy professional wrestler and expresses pretty much the same evil sentiments. It could be that these types of series just will not work anymore, at least not anything long-term. But who knows, maybe in the coming episodes something new and special will be added. I might go one more episode, or perhaps just part of one. Like I said, for a series to really catch my attention it has to be above average. The Supergirl pilot was not bad, it just was not above average. ","6"
"Supergirl",2015-10-30," Spoilers, Supergirl starts with a rushed introduction, Kara is given about 25 seconds of back-story of her time on krypton. Instead they skip to her being the stock un-empowered female who must overcome her insecurities as a woman. Again <U+0085> let me clarify, an infinitely powerful alien superhero has been re-envisioned to be the standard girl meets world, who has to go and find her inner confidence. Okay! Okay screw it! She didn't land on earth, oh no! We have officially landed on the planet of fruit loops and tap dancing mega penguins! I don't remember much about jimmy Olsen so I don't personally have an opinion, but on principle it's a bad idea to completely change a preexisting character. Kara acts like a star struck teenager the whole episode. The show poorly imitates superman's first flight and show also leaches off of superman constantly. Then even rips off the opening of superman returns. The show treats the audience like they are all basically children. On top of that the entire episode is completely incoherent. This single episode focuses on at least 8-10 plots. Leaving the viewer confused about life and probably a little scared. The lead character is the average geek girl with the intelligence of a teenager and is basically a cookie cutter cut out. The acting is horrible and doesn't convey anything that would make these characters seem like believable people, except Kara's sister. All of the character's traits are overdramatized like a cartoon, again because the company assumes it's audience it too stupid to notice anything unless it talks down to you. The dialogue is either cliché or political. At least Kara's sister is actually the only character so far act like an adult, but the rest act like idiots.Finally, the show constantly crams self-defeating and off topic feminist speeches and empowerment messages down your throat. Good female characters don't ever have to point out that they are female or make speeches about their power. If a character is good, you never care that the character is female or male. The music is loud, obnoxious, and distracted from any dialogue or potential atmosphere. At least the FX were OK sometimes, but they need a lot of polish. There is no emotional conflict because there are no believable or relatable characters. The fights are good, the only problem is that the show crams in a bunch of comic relief and one liners like Michael Bay.SUGGESTIONS: This isn't the first failed teeny show this company has made, and teeny shows are the only type this company creates, except supernatural. Start by not ruining a preexisting story and branch into other target audiences, You may be making money off of these shows now, but the best way to gain ratings and money is to make your shows unique and worth while in their own right. Because what you fail to realize is that your audience is not as retarded as you think, and not only preteens watch your channels. Focus on smarter, and believable characters. They should be more capable of avoiding obvious mistakes, clever, and basically not being teenagers so they can  grow up/develop . As for this show, start over, if there were a completely different show, with different casts and story lines, I would still try it, and if it were good I would continue watching it. Cancel this current show then in a couple years, start over from complete scratch. Suggestions for Kara: In the superman cartoon, Kara was a more wild teenage girl. That was better than this current show because Kara had a believable reason to have a rough, and have an uncontrolled personality. Her parents were killed, she will never see her home again, and she had to learn to survive in a chaotic alien world, no kid would be unscathed. The first couple of episodes can start with how she grew up and use maybe a few time lapses (NOT FLASHBACKS) of her first 5-8 earth years, and show as much well-paced detail as you can. Then transition to the main story with her still being still young, probably still somewhat a teen, but don't make her an idiotic brat. Also try a two episode premiere so you don't rush. Try a tone that is more like supernatural, not whimsical, maybe not brutal, but realistic. Kara should be smarter and more resourceful, and not entirely rely on brute force, but don't make it the standard flash formula, the flash fails with idiotic brute force so the team convenes and comes up with a convoluted plan that works just in time for the end of the episode. Also instead of the main characters having some generic character flaw like  un-empowered , and instead of having everyone else preach to Kara and give her obvious advice, have Kara also be the one giving advice of advice to the other characters Finally try having her be more street smart or stealthy, but maybe still has to learn patience, but this is just preference.

"Supergirl",2015-10-29," If you can avoid those inevitable reviews where you either have people that don't support a female lead, or want their DC shows to mirror every comic story they have ever read, then you will find a show with the same potential that the Flash started with. Every criticism, for a pilot, applies to the Flash and Arrow as well, so give it time and you should enjoy this series. No pilot is perfect, but if you enjoy anything in the Superman/Supergirl universe (or watched Smallville) then stick around! I enjoyed how it fit into the established Superman universe and has opened itself up to a lot of villain potential. Melissa Benoist is quite believable, and apart from the necessary sappy references to Superman (to establish the character) it is something worth watching. ","8"
"Supergirl",2015-10-29," I'll admit it wasn't terrible, but the first episode gradually got worse as it progressed. I'm not going to go over specifics, but here are the problems I have with the  Supergirl  so far:1) Melissa Benoist:Since was one of the few actresses who was looked at for the role, even though she doesn't have a creditable filmography, it was most-likely because she's blonde. She clearly didn't do that great of a job playing  Kara Danvers  (even though the actual alias of Kara Zor-El is Linda Lee Danvers) or as Supergirl. While her clumsiness and being a typical office intern is a decent disguise at first, it doesn't last long when she decides to show off her powers to the guy at the office who tries to ask her out on a date. It would've made more sense if the two had chemistry for a good 4-5 episodes, he soon develops suspicions of her alter-ego, causing him to figure out that she is Supergirl. On top of that, she treats her  heroism  almost like a game and doesn't understand the weight of her role as a heroine. She also doesn't bother to get superheroine training (so she would know how to be one and use her powers effectively) and throws together a crappy costume and claims that makes her Supergirl (instead of having her costume come with her in her pod). Any superhero(ine) would have trained themselves, or got training from a master, and she gets defeated multiple times as a result. Clearly she wasn't a good choice.2) The rest of the characters are out of character:While Allura seemed okay, Jimmy Olsen isn't nerdy like he is the comics (and he's a photographer for the Daily Planet, not an art director for some company that doesn't have any relation to the comics), and Kat Grant is a narcissist who now supposedly owns her own media company. Superman only makes a cameo, and you'd think he would've shown up when he heard Kara had saved the people on the plane. The rest of the other characters have no back story, and seem like they're just thrown into the episode so the writers could add more characters.3) The show barely follows the comics:It seems like the people who made the show decided to simply plaster Supegirl's name on it, and acted like they knew the character. Just like the 1998 Godzilla movie, they were more interested in the title, not the character. I don't know what kind of drugs they were on to think it would be a good idea for Fred and Edna Danvers (who are now named  Jeremiah  and  Eliza ) to only have a cameo, and instead have some made up sister named Alex has a lot of screen time. I also don't know why there's supposedly some secret government organization that deals with alien invasions. The writers could only be on cocaine if they thought that was good idea.4) It's  fun  and  light-hearted , instead of being epic and deep:Regardless of what your opinion about Man of Steel is, the people who made that movie portrayed Clark Kent/Superman as a powerful god-like being. Nowhere is there an understanding of that in Kara's character, or in the episode itself. If that was included in the episode, and Kara had to make several hard choices in the episode, she would understand her role as a superheroine, because of the emotional weight it bares on her, and it would make her character more likable. It would also make the show more grounded instead of flimsy and quickly thrown together.I'm not here to promote anything, but these reasons and more are why I immediately thought of making my own version so I can improve it. I'm not one of those people who rant about a show or movie, and then allow the idiots and Hollywood continue to run rampant. As a member of the audience, I'm entitled to stand up to Hollywood if they're going to act lazy, greedy, or careless.

"Supergirl",2015-10-29," The adventures of Superman's cousin in her own superhero career. Supergirl is the latest DC Comics adaptation from producers Greg Berlanti and Andrew Kreisberg. Taking a page from The Flash and Smallville before it, the series also seeks to establish via Kara's origin tale a deeper mythology and an excuse for Earth to be populated by various super-beings. Supergirl arrived late in the booklet of comic book super-heroine that emerged after Wonder Woman in 1941. Though in the 60s she was a supporting player in the Superman family of titles. Until getting her first dedicated series in 1972. She has seen some reboots, pushed by publishers to diversify themselves. Did you know there's now a female Thor? A female Hawkeye and Spider-Gwen? This introductory hour holds closely to that pair producer's formula for The Flash, elevating an adorable Glee cast (there Grant Gustin, here Melissa Benoist) to a costumed-icon status. I'm glad Supergirl exists and I really want it to succeed. It's more than fine with me if it never becomes more than a solid superhero genre show with a female lead - especially since that lead is fantastic. Although Melissa Benoist is not unknown (especially to Glee viewers - like me - who made it past season 3) she's one of those rare casting miracle. She nails the title role: handling very well her dual role, it creates hope for the show going forward. Perfect casting. Her performance embraces, internalises and sells the character's contradictions and paradoxes. Melissa makes Kara feels real, she wears the costume proudly and easily while embodying joy and complexity all at once. Moreover, Calista Flockhart as the central character media mogul boss, Cat Grant, gives the show a Devil Wears Prada vibe. The first super-heroic act is a plane rescue that vaguely echoes the original Christopher Reeve's Superman. As in that movie there's a scene of exultation in which Kara explores her powers after so many years trying to blend in and be normal. A central idea in Superman's origin is that he is super not because of his powers, but because of the character cultivated by his parent. Here we're introduced to the Danvers, scientists and former TV show Superman father Dean Cain. Knowingly engages gender issues, including about the representation of women in pop culture. It's something rare: a superhero series that isn't about a superman. Indeed, writers smartly fit Supergirl's origin story to a very current feminist theme: that women must overcome being socialised to say sorry, o put themselves second or to efface themselves. Rather delivers its message with an enthusiastic bluntness that hearkens back to its comic roots. The name  Supergirl  is ultimately explained, seeking to deflect any charges of sexism about the  girl  designation. The most meta scene comes when Cat Grant coins this name and defends it to Kara , who tries to argue that perhaps  SuperWoman  would be a more appropriate and respectful name.  I'm a girl  says Cat,  and your boss and powerful and rich and hot and smart. So if you perceive  Supergirl  as anything less than excellent, isn't the real problem you? . The argument she makes is debatable but worth having. Finally, Supergirl could be filling a shameful void after Buffy the Vampire Slayer and Veronica Mars. That needs to be followed by more contemporary properties such as (hopefully) the upcoming Netflix series, Marvel's Jessica Jones. In a field long dominated by men, Supergirl provides a superhero roe model for girls and young women while symbolising values anyone could admire.  Can you believe it? A female hero. Nice for my daughter to have someone like that to look up to.  Yes that is nice. Now we need more. Overall, finding the right star and building a credible pilot are big parts of the battle. Thanks to those strengths if the producers can sustain the playfulness and action without going overboard, there's reason to believe this  girl  can fly. ","8"
"Supergirl",2015-10-29," First of all I love Superman and all characters associated with it and when I found out they were going to make a Supergirl-series, I was okay with it, even when the trailer went online, it seemed okay.OH BOY WAS I WRONG!First of all, this series ruins everything related to Superman in every way. Kal-El doesn't want help, WHAT!? Humans know almost everything about Krypton (the secret organization I mean) WHAT!? They know the name of the secret prison locked up in Phantom Zone. WHAT!? The alien fights Kara with no holes barred but runs from the humans, HOW!? WHY!? WHAT!? All in all. Totally worthless episode. Would give it 0/10, but can't give that in IMDb.. ","1"
"Supergirl",2015-10-28," I am surprised by the low IMDb scores. This show is much better than a 6. I won't speculate on whyI'm an older dude so I won't claim I enjoyed all the teen girl scenes, but overall the show is well-written, well-acted, and well-directed. It has great special effects and fight sequences. Melissa Benoist and Calista Flockhart really steal the show.The only thing that's odd about it is the complete absence of Superman, who is referred to in 3rd person several times. Yet he can't fly in for a hug or to help her when she's struggling? But this is a minor complaint. We know why, and we understand, I think.This show is much better than Green Arrow, and has the potential to be better than The Flash. I urge you to watch and decide for yourself. ","10"
"Supergirl",2015-10-28," Bad acting, bad writing, boring show, huge disappointment... I love superhero shows and movies, I'm very loyal to them, sadly Supergirl was excruciating to watch. Clearly geared for a high-school audience, with that level of education and vapidness. Melissa Benoist and Calista Flockhart's acting reminded me of an extremely cheap-knock-off of Anne Hathaway and Meryl Streep in The Devil Wears Prada. Also, Calista Flockhart's face is so disturbing to look at, lets just say: obviously way too much plastic surgery gone terribly wrong (i.e. Cat-Lady). I can't really see how this show can be picked-up for a full season, but I guess stranger things have happened... ","3"
"Supergirl",2015-10-28," The pilot has a lot in it, establishing plot lines for the upcoming season with Supergirl emerging from her shell and rescuing a plane and taking on enemies from Krypton. I like the humorous attitude that recalls the first Superman with Christopher Reeve rather than the recent more somber reboots. Melissa Benoist is a good choice likable and pleasant not too distinctive looking so she can blend nicely into either of her personas. Calista Flockhart as the editor boss seems a little less eccentric and silly than of late. The romance with Jimmy Olsen (Mechad Brooks) seems there to represent diversity. Better to let romance evolve more naturally. Look forward to seeing more of Helen Slater.Promising Greg Berlanti production again. ","8"
"Supergirl",2015-10-28," Wow!!! I had my doubts as the hype was brewing, but as a minority and a subject of prejudice my entire life, it would have been hypocritical of me to give it a thumbs down without at least viewing it. Personally I think every new offering deserves at least three airings before it gets shelved. Every offering except this one!!! This show was so bad I found myself laughing through half of it. The kind of laughing you do when someone tickles you; and as much as you want it to stop (because you're not enjoying it) you can't because you have no choice. CBS left me no choice but to hate this show. The writing, the characters, the plot, all of it just screamed: HELP ME!!! Sorry, but if this show lasts in prime time for more than a month, CBS should be ashamed of themselves. I know it's all about ratings, but if by some miracle Supergirl manages to secure high viewer ship over the coming weeks, I still think they should show some modicum of self respect by taking the video files out back, shooting them, and making sure no backup copies exist. Putting shows like this on in prime time is tantamount to drastically lowering the standards of standardized tests; essentially making us ignorant and lazy in our creativity. If Supergirl MUST remain on television, perhaps it should air on Saturday mornings where children's entertainment thrives. ","1"
"Supergirl",2015-10-28," OK, this is a TV show. About a comic book superhero. But it wasn't really supposed to be about saving the world, was it?A great deal of the pre-buzz surrounding Supergirl was its feminist vibe, with commercials showing young girls being empowered by the message. Well, forget all that, because Kara is so intimidated by her boss she won't demand the correct pronunciation of her name, thinks nothing in her life has value except her alien powers, can't go ten minutes without comparing her worth to her cousin, and is so unsure of her own feelings she can't set clear emotional boundaries with an office crush. Not to mention her menial job (that somehow affords her a corner highrise apartment, but I digress). I mean, if she's had a burning in her heart to save the world her whole life, why not make her a cybersecurity expert? She could still work for the same media empire and wouldn't have to rely on a police scanner on a coffee table.For a show cocooning itself in feminist armor, though, the worst violation also happened to be a major plot point. The major turn at the end of the second act sees our hero ASKING PERMISSION to be a hero... from the director of a shadowy government agency... an alpha male. I can't recall of another origin story where the titular hero had to ask to be ungrounded so they could go save the day. Perhaps the marketing department thought this was too assertive.Corporate thumbprints are all over this pilot. Odd product placement (whiskey featured in a show aimed at families?), retread reveal so lame they put a lighthouse on it (the plane crash), and my favorite, a front-runner for the Heartless Legal Team of the Year at WB for not allowing any mention of the words  Superman  or  Clark Kent .My concern is the network will keep up the monster-of-the-week recipe they've established so clearly in the pilot. That will get old. Fast. Also troubling is the  friendzone  relationship they have going with their Superfriends (but  we're not calling ourselves that anymore ). Get the guy or move on.I gave this four stars because I see potential IF they loose the shackles. Show Supergirl standing up to the superspies and have them follow her lead. Deal with the fugitive round up, or at least make them interesting. I'm thinking space plague harmless to Earthlings. Perhaps Calista Flockhart could remind Melissa Benoist how much guff Ally McBeal didn't take, short skirt and all. And for goodness sake, give Dean Cain some lines. The ironic humor in having him deliver fatherly advice could be a goldmine. ","4"
"Supergirl",2015-10-28," Superman's legacy continues through the eye's of his cousin Kara(Melissa Benoist) who does have the same powers has her cousin, but lays low cause of her adopted sister Alex(Chyler Leigh) insists she should fit in. But Kara want's to become the hero she was meant to be like her cousin was.The effects are quite effective, even on a T.V. budget. Scenes where Kara is using her powers are pretty good, shows that she is trying to get a good handle on them, when trying to be a hero. Melissa Beonist is charming portraying Kara's innocence, although some of her dialog does get a little clunky, but she fits the role perfectly. Chyler Leigh is also good as Alex. Calista Flockhart is great has Kara's boss, channeling Meryl Streep from The Devil Wears Prada. D.C is getting quite big on small screen with Arrow and The Flash, I hope Supergirl will be just as good. ","8"
"Supergirl",2015-10-28," The series has such an awful start that there is no way it can improve. Poorly selected cast coupled with a crap story line...come on, its the FIRST episode and half the cast knows who supergirl is. Since acting is far below TV standards, there is no point of expecting any improvement. Sometimes, one doesn't like a series because of one sideline character etc; here, there isn't any hope since the lead cast doesn't know how to act. In a way, I am happy that the story line is also not good, otherwise, I would have continued to watch in hopes of the supergirl getting replaced at a later stage (which we all know would not happen). I was so much looking forward to this program, and am utterly disappointed as it is, by far, the worst ever super hero series. ","1"
"Supergirl",2015-10-27," I was looking forward to this show, but OMG what a disappointment. Where do I begin, Jimmy Olsen is a big, ripped, confident, jock who acts like superman raised him from birth. The writers obviously didn't do their research, they refer to the Christopher Reeves superman story line a lot and one time, in particular, Jimmy, who wants to be called  James  mentions Superman's first heroic feat as saving an airplane...although it was Lois Lane and a helicopter if I recall. Furthermore every other conversation has some sort of blatant feminist agenda attached to it, and they use these off center, awkward, conversations to tell you how strong women are instead of showing you to prove their point. I mean it may have been overlooked if it was just once but they throw it in your face every few minutes, so much so that feminists themselves had to be rolling their eyes. Not to mention actions speak louder than words, I want to see how awesome Supergirl is, if I wanted her to tell me over, and over again, I would go watch some political debate somewhere. The acting was awful, it would be poor for a 1970's sitcom, weird awkward conversations that have no meaning, or feeling, totally unbelievable, corny, and just simply annoying. The writers did straiten out a few story issues, that everyone seemed to have with the universe, but at the same time they punched so many more holes in it, things that just didn't make sense if you've ever seen any other DC superhero in your lifetime. The show was then rushed, within the short time frame they dropped all of the story elements on you, introduced every character, and never really explained when, why, or how. Things just are, now accept it, and I am sure most people will just eventually accept it as the shows continue. I realistically couldn't watch half way through it without throwing up in my mouth. The only reason why it stayed on my TV was because my 4 year old really liked the idea of a Supergirl flying around the sky. If she had any idea what was going on with the conversations or story, she would probably be throwing up too. Even if I had no prior knowledge of this story it was so bad that I do not have words to express it, believe me what I said above was nice compared to what I want to say. ","1"
"Supergirl",2015-10-27," For a pilot episode I thought that Supergirl delivered big time! I thought that Melissa Benoist did an incredible job portraying Kara (Superman's cousin), and I enjoyed her quirky, awkward, and the lack of confidence she portrayed as she was learning to become a hero! It made me so happy that the writers didn't drag out episode after episode until we finally get to see Supergirl in her costume and I imagine that to make the show different from Superman they didn't want to have the whole Louis Lane thing with her friend Winn wondering over the course of seasons the identity of the new caped crusader. All in all I thought it was a very fun, entertaining, and exciting start to what has been my favorite new show of Fall 2015. ","10"
"Supergirl",2015-10-27," I had been looking forward to this show for quite some time, but when I watched it I just became bored and sleepy. The acting and writing is not very good. From the pilot it seems like the show wants to put heavy focus on female empowerment to a point where it seems forced and with the only objective of drawing in female viewers.It felt like it was made for people between the ages of 7-15.Somewhat bad casting, somewhat bad acting and just bad writing. Show suffers greatly. Only thing able to keep me watching is the special effects. ","5"
"Supergirl",2015-10-27," I absolutely loved it! Why? Because it is an unapologetic superhero show with a FEMALE lead. Not a woman trying to act like a guy or trying to be sensual. There are long time male comicbook fans who will probably hate this because it doesn't fit their mold, their skewed idea of what a female superhero should be. That's OK. This show isn't FOR THEM. It's for the young (and old) female comic fans out there. The ones that want a genuine hero that THEY can relate to. One that doesn't portray women as just some guys fantasy. If you read a negative review of this show, it will PROBABLY be written by a guy, not necessarily, but probably.All of that said, this IS a more light hearted, FAMILY FRIENDLY show. It's not dark, it's not edgy or overly violent. (At least not so far.) I personally think this is a good thing, especially for families. We have enough superhero shows aimed squarely at adults. (I.E. S.H.I.E.L.D., Daredevil, Jessica Jones, even Arrow) I LIKE there is something other than just the Flash that kids can watch & parents can feel comfortable about.So watch Supergirl. It's good. It's not your dad's superhero show. ;) ","10"
"Supergirl",2015-10-27," Tuesday, 27 October 2015: I am a big fan of Superman even more than Batman since I was a teenager in my favorite decade, the seventies {70's}, I have loved such comics as Superman, Spiderman and Aladdin. I am even rooting for Superman to win in the upcoming movie, Batman vs Superman. I still think the best actor with the best look to ever portray Superman was the late Christopher Reeve.Anyhoo, with all the airing of previews of the pending  Supergirl  and the fact that I have like cute and funny actress, Calista Flockhart, ever since watching her on her TV series  Ally McBeal  by writer David Kelley, I was excited to make sure that I watch Supergirl because I am a big fan of the Superman series.The series is Not bad, but it could be a lot better. I am all for opening up doors for African American, Latino and Asian actors to portray all roles, but Mehcad Brooks does Not fit the role of Jimmy. The old saying of  if it's not broke, don't fix it . He is to old to play Jimmy. Jimmy should be a first year college student type. They could write a new role for Mecad to play.They should stick to the original story line, where only her earth parents and maybe one other person knows (her earth sister) who Supergirl really is. She should Not be telling her co-workers and this special government agency that her earth sister works for her identify. If she is going to tell two co-workers, she just as well tell her boss and the entire office staff.I like Calista (Mrs. Harrison Ford) as an actress, but it seems her or the writers are trying to make her character out to copycat the brilliant Meryl Streep role as the queen of mean from  Devil Wears Prada . Calista can't pull that off. Leave that type of role to brilliant actress, Meryl or Julia Roberts. The mean sarcastic boss does Not fit Calista at all. ","6"
"Supergirl",2015-10-26," It seems many of the critics were expecting something along the lines of Man of Steel or CW's Flash/Arrow, Supergirl is not that. Although the show has two of the same producers of the aforementioned CW shows, it's less dark and moody. It is more of a lighthearted drama with action and comedy. The cast is upbeat and fun to watch especially the lead, Kara Danvers. She is very endearing as she confronts challenges in the real world and in the supernatural world. The background music is solid and uplifting. Some of the dialogue gets cheesy but it doesn't diminish the story. The story is simple and easy to follow. Some sophisticated viewers might find it banal. Hardcore DC comic fans might be disappointed as well by the casting and storyline but for the average viewer, you'll love Supergirl. ","10"
"Supergirl",2015-10-26," This show is HORRIBLE. Bad writing, unappealing characters, and CGI that looks like it was done in film school. Calista Flockhart's character makes my skin crawl. Yes, yes, she's a female Donald Trump, but she's also uninspired and a complete cliché. The Devil Wears Prada anyone? Melissa Benoist is Super-cute, but that doesn't make her Supergirl either. Though I cannot blame that on her, as the writing was terrible. They tried to smash so much into one episode that any chance at a meaningful story was lost in the mad rush to get all of the info out the door.And again, did they find the CG artists in elementary school? It was so bad as to distract from what little story there actually was.Only plus, Mehcad Brooks, as Jimmy Olsen. I liked him, but i don't know if he and Melissa Benoist's cuteness can keep me around for more than a few episodes. ","3"
"Supergirl",2015-10-26," Meh. I was hoping for more kick ass entertainment. We get Amy McBeal recast as a ball busting b$tch. Jimmy Olsen is mixed African. Supergirl is a knock kneed girl that gets excited and can't make up her mind. Supergirl fights like an, um, girl. She gives up her identity to some smuck in the office that wants to, um, date her. In the fight with the mutant from outer space with a nuclear axe she almost gets killed. I was hoping he would slip his hand up her short little skirt and give her a little goose. I ended up flipping between this and DWTS.How can they improve this. Get better writing. More spandex (or less). I'm not into the whole feminista thing, but maybe that is the audience they are looking for. At least they waited for the game to be over before showing it. ","5"
"Supergirl",2015-10-26," I am writing this about 2 hours after the premiere of Supergirl, so I am commenting on the actual show that aired tonight, not a leaked, unfinished version on the web. In a word, it was terrific. I found the character of Kara/Supergirl a nice mixture of young woman with hopes and fears along with more power and drive within her than she had realized. Melissa Benoist was amazing--she did really well playing the divided character of a low- key human and this emerging superhero. I liked the power and joy of her first take off to fly, trying more than once to get off the ground, and how her face changes when she is flying to where she is needed. I liked Smallville, but this isn't Smallville nor should it be. It is a different kind of show with a lot more comic book action it it and a different kind of storytelling. I liked the characters, especially Kara's sister and her obnoxious boss. Both of them were multi-dimensional--not all good or bad--and I think in the future we will see a lot more interesting things from them. The villains are sooooo evil as to be one-dimensional, but hey, it is comics, not Shakespeare. We'll have to watch for more development in the future.I have to mention the change of Jimmy Olsen from a freckled redhead to a tall, gorgeous African American man played by Mehcad Brooks. It jarred me at first because it was so unexpected, but by the end of the show I was a total fan. We don't need another young guy learning the ropes when Supergirl is the one doing that in this series. Interesting choice that works for me, but might not work for everyone. All in all, I thought the show was terrific. And I was not alone in this. I started watching it alone, but by the end of the show both my husband and son had joined me and were engrossed. It was a hit for all of us. I highly recommend Supergirl! ","10"
"Supergirl",2015-10-26," OK... I gave this show a fair chance. The casting is poorly executed and lazy. Supervisor is not blonde, but I can overlook that... I'm sorry, but JIMMY Olsen is supposed to be red haired, freckled and geeky. Several stories in the comics were based on this. Now we zoom into the future, regardless of his color, suddenly Jimmy Olsen turns into a physically cut confident manly man that insists on being called James. This is just too big of departure from the roots of the story. Making characters another race is expected in this age of TV diversity, but you need to keep their essence. They didn't and ruined the story for me. I can't take this adaptation serious.... Jimmy Olsen is a geek and us comic fans are geeks, he is one of our own, not a cut gym rat. It gets a 1 star in my book. Killing a story in a poor attempt to be diverse. ","1"
"Supergirl",2015-10-26," This has to be the WORST Super Hero series ever to be on television.It is offensive how the writing team simply ignores the sixty year history of the Super Girl characters. Nowhere is this more evident than in the casting of Mehad Brooks as Jimmy Olson. At age 35 he is at leasta dozen years older than the character should be. Brooks is far too long in the tooth and far too worldly to play the Ultimate sidekick. Also annoyingly miscast is David Harewood as Hank Henshaw. This British actor never quite manages to do a convincing American Accent.Calista Flockhart as the  Boss  is incredibly horrible. She pouts her way through every scene -- so horribly BAD you want to run screaming from the room. Flockhart is not strong enough as an Actor to pull off this role. She lacks the personal gravitas to be a convincing Leader. I would send her immediately off to the Phantom Zone.Melissa Benoist lacks the charisma to play a Super Hero. Her scenes with Jeremy Jordan are totally lacking in any chemistry. This Turkey should be done by Thanksgiving.... ","2"
"Supergirl",2015-10-26," Despite the fact that it isn't great, it has a lot of potential. It's something new, something different. I Don't think it should be written off just yet. If I could suggest anything it'd be that you watch it yourself instead of listening to all the hate other users are giving it. It could be better and there's no doubt about it, however if you gave it a chance you may enjoy it. There have been mentions of possible Crossovers with other series such as the Flash and Arrow, so if you enjoy any of those shows you may enjoy Supergirl. While it is a bit quirky and awkward at times it is watchable. That's all I can really say, but watch it for yourself before listening to hateful reviews. ","8"
"Supergirl",2015-10-26," The lead actress CAN T act, she was terrible in Glee and even worse in this. The show is just one long crap-fest. She does looks at the camera and make a dumb face for everything, everyone is one dimensional and they have so much makeup on them you could hold a candle to their face and it would melt. Gross! Save yourself some time and skip this mess, CBS should be ashamed of themselves for making such garbage and trying to pass it off as inspiring or a role-model for young girls.I didn't think writing for television could be this bad, but it really is that bad. ","1"
"Supergirl",2015-10-26," Inject Supergirl into the movie  The Devil Wears Prada,  and this is what you get. Which is, in my opinion, a bold and refreshingly simple direction to take comic book entertainment in from here on.If we have to be subjected to aliens and clichéd, two dimensional villains, then they might as well happen in a watchable, familiar environment. The watchability begins here with the perky, hot blonde in that red skirt flying around, and continues with her alter ego being bossed around by a female boss at work, while dealing with deep emotional turmoil with her sister at home.CBS is the best right now at capturing audiences' attention,  The Good Wife  being one of the most visible examples of this, a show that continues to fascinate viewers and critics on the strength of nothing more than restrained cattiness among beautiful, sophisticated women, with a healthy dose of near pornographic lesbianism thrown in every now and then for good measure. If this show ever has the guts to send this strangely cast black Jimmy Olsen back to Metropolis, and replace him with a black or Asian girl for Kara Zor-El to be interested in, we might have something irresistible.But for now, we'll have to make do with what we have. A pretty blonde girl in a short red skirt and red boots, lifting airplanes in the sky and slamming into trucks on the highway. All while running around in her mousy alter ego, trying to impress her sadistic female boss in the big city. How can you not watch this speeding train of a show, to see whether or not it will run or wreck in the future? But brilliantly, the pilot episode ended with enough heat to guarantee at least some future interest, when they introduced an INCREDIBLY beautiful female villain for our heroine to deal with, who is actually Supergirl's aunt from Krypton, if you can believe it. The idea of this impending woman to woman action has created a rare commodity in network television these days. Genuine watchability. ","7"
"Supergirl",2015-10-26," DC scheduled GOTHAM, based on Batman, a DC character, to run 8 PM to 9 PM.DC scheduled SUPERGIRL, based on Superman, a DC character, to run 8:30 to 9:30 PM.Same evening.Why would they schedule this competing overlap between two of their own properties?As to the near-opening scene saving a plane, didn't DC do that with Brendan Roush in his first SUPERMAN movie? Don't freak out but I also heard this superfeat in a SUPERMAN radio show from the mid-'forties. Bud Collyer was ultra-convincing as Supe.Also, the quirks in the storyline were predictable as this show involves people behind DC product ARROW whose storyline seems to change as their writers' inabilities to work out story arcs decide to change arbitrarily. A traditional cliffhanger? Car going off cliff and down ends one week. Next week, car actually swerved safely. ","6"
"Supergirl",2015-10-26," There's gonna be some SPOILERS so be prepared. The first wrong is that she revealed she her secret identity to a coworker the morning after she saved a plane. The next wrong is that Jimmy Olsen you know the weird geeky ginger photographer is a tall suave black dude. I mean what's up with that. Oh and her coworker just happens to know how to make a fancy superhero suit and hack into police scanners. The last thing is that they disregarded most of the stuff from the man of steal. Like they have Kryptonite restraints for super girl but how do they know what Kryptonite does. Also they have superman's first rescue was stopping a crashing plane. I'm pretty sure it was fighting Zod and his bozos'. If you watch the trailer for that crappy dawn of  Justice  movie he's on trial for that whole debacle. In the movie he wasn't superman. Superman wouldn't fight Zod in a crowded city where even more people would die. ","3"
"Supergirl",2015-10-26," no words to express this atrocity..too many reasons to list - watched the pilot and that was way too much watching - - - you can stop reading - the rest of this is fulfill the 10 line minimum - so I was old enough to think Helen slater was a babe and even back then I could not bring myself to watch that show -so bad - and contrived, predictable, already done, over acted persona;s, silly plot line, it is amazing to me how great the pitches to the backers of these types of productions - someone, several people had to say - why yes - i can sell advertisement space for this and I assume that going beyond breaking even is enough to justify a season and now a season 2 - and oh how I fell in love with Dr Lexie - i was surprised at her here - and I think lots of discussions can occur with some character choices - but maybe that was the point of this seemingly pointless rehash - lets begin talking about meaningful sub-texts and silly plots and how they translate to everyday life for common folk that can be easily entertained but such simple shows....? hmm that might be brilliant - or super..

"Supergirl",2015-10-24," I saw the Pilot that leaked online months ago and i've seen it some weeks ago and i was almost sure that this show would suck but i was so wrong yes it looks like Devil wears Prada meets DC Comics but it's more than that. First of all the cgi is good for a TV Show, 2nd of all the cast is good not perfect or anything but good but i mostly like Melissa Benoist she is a great Supergirl also the series has 2 cameos from 2 old actors that played in previous Superman Movies and TV Shows i won't spoil it and i loved the action that moment when she finds this guy was badass. If you loved Arrow and Flash you will probably like this one also i hope the show continues to be as good as the Pilot and even better. Give it a chance you might like it. ","10"
"Supergirl",2015-10-23," In 2001 two very young artistes, Gough and Miller, launched a TV series called SMALLVILLE. Although some critics, including this one, think the series got a bit lost over its 10-year (!) run, there is no denying that writing casting acting and direction were superb.Some 14 years later we have this entry, astonishingly getting grade A promotion from the network, promotion which offers a promise that the show, at least in the premiere, barely delivers.Aside from Benoist herself, who is perky enough for 3 heroines, the quality was not there. Writing, character development, casting, acting, even the SFX were not only weak but way below the bar set by SMALLVILLE, a decade earlier. ","6"
"Supergirl",2015-10-19," out of all the superhero TV shows lately, this one has got to be the cheapest. And i don't necessarily mean that in terms of budget, but in terms of effects, screenplay, dialogue, and acting... i guess a lot of us were expecting something in the continuity of Arrow and The Flash, and even if these TV shows also have major flaws (like bad guys shooting assault rifles with stormtrooper accuracy for example),and though Supergirl predicted a more light-hearted feel to it, it could have been entertaining. But it's not. It's painful. It looks like someone slapped up this show in the 90s, and it's just coming out now. The effects are poor, the story is just rushed with no explanation or development. Things just happen really fast and with sometimes borderline acting (Supergirl has these weird grimaces... is it voluntary?), and people just do what they do, and we're supposed to be like  oh, OK, no time to explain . Like  SPOILERS!!!!!!This dude who we find out is her best friend, to whom she tells her secret just like that BAAM! and who's also in love with her who also just hacks into police surveillance for her and also makes her a suit with  polymer  blabla high tech stuff although he's just a normal office worker like her. And all that in about 2 minutes. Convenient much? SPOILER ENDS HEREAND STEREOTYPES!! so many stereotypes that have been going on since EVERY TV SHOW EVER! Even Smallville delivered better content then this. You'd think they would move on to new things. It just makes you cringe, you know? It's possible you might like this show... if you don't ask questions and just pretend everything makes sense, or if you think the actress is cute, but don't go looking for a  good  TV show. Just try to get past the pilot if you can! But with so many  fails  in one episode, it's too disappointing to carry on. ","3"
"Supergirl",2015-10-13," First of all, i might say a lot of negative things in this review, but i'd like to assert that so far, i like the show just fine! It's got some good humor, the characters are fun (even if the acting is, at times, a little stiff), and the story captured my attention enough that I went to look up the second episode immediately even though i knew it wasn't going to come out for a few weeks yet! Nonetheless, I do have some things that did bother me.One of my main problems was how thick they laid on the feminism. As a feminist, I did actually agree with everything they said, but the best way to showcase your ideals is not to throw them in a viewer's face, but to demonstrate them. Show, not tell. The design of her costume and the presentation of it--awesome! The way there's almost constant  what, you think she can't do it because she's a /woman/? well you're wrong because LOOK AT HOW FEMINIST WE ARE!!! -- please don't patronize me. If i were to describe their attitude in one word, i would probably say either  defensive  or  aggressive . Maybe both. It's the same as in one of those pretentious over-the- top environmental films that tries to make its point by throwing nature in your face and demonizing man instead of just showing you the beauty of nature that we're slowly losing. You don't have to be aggressive about it--if you act like her being a superhero woman is normal, viewers will see a superhero woman as normal.In relation to this point, we move to the combat, probably my least favorite part of the pilot episode. For a pilot episode, they presented Kara with a particularly powerful opponent. He was strong, was able to injure her (which could have been a bigger deal and an interesting dilemma if they had brought that in after at least a few episodes), and clearly overpowered her on many occasions. In the first episode, you really want to showcase the ability of your protagonist, especially in a superhero show. You make your protagonist impressive. It would have been much cooler if we got to see Kara tossing her opponent around like a rag-doll in the first episode. I want to see her pick up a guy and throw him fifty feet. I want to see her punch a man through a concrete wall without breaking a sweat. I want to see her land before her opponent before a fight and leave a crater where she set foot. I want to see her shoot lasers like a policeman shoots a gun. I want to see her be /AWESOME/. What i got however, was an opponent so strong that her powers seemed almost useless. So strong that she seemed to be at the strength of an almost normal human while she fought with him. I want to know why I felt almost like her powers were sort of run-of- the- mill even though they repeatedly assured us that she was just as obnoxiously strong and fast as Superman? It was actually really not fun to watch her be repeatedly thrown to the ground, repeatedly overpowered; to see her repeatedly have to use words to get her opponent to lower his guard so she could regain the upper hand. I'm tired of seeing a woman have to use her head to beat a man. I want Supergirl to be able to plow through her opponents just like Superman. I want to see Supergirl just go in blind like an idiot and come out as the victor for once, instead of having to forcibly be taught that she  can't win just with pure strength like men can . I want to see her overpower him with little effort. I want to see her kick his butt to next Sunday. I want to see her strong and confident and not needing to think her way out of a bad situation because /she's strong enough that she doesn't get into the bad situation in the first place/. Getting kicked around and overpowered by her opponent should be a obstacle in later episodes. Finding that maybe she does need more training should be for later, when she's become maybe a little overconfident in her abilities. Showing her feeling lost of hopeless and considering giving up should be halfway through the season, not in the first episode. Some of the best elements of a Superhero show were used up in the first episode. Everyone we currently care about already knows she's Supergirl, so we don't get to wait in hope that that one character that doesn't know, will find out about it. The becoming disheartened about abilities and coming back stronger than ever was used up. We already see the face of our current greatest adversary, and even more disappointing, we even know who they are and what their goal is, removing all mystery. It's just a little underwhelming.For a show that's so aggressive about how feminist it is, it sure comes up shockingly short in the parts that really matter in showcasing that belief. Overall, there are a lot of things about this show that I don't like, however, I still want to see more. I'm still sucked in to the story. I'm still anxiously awaiting episode two. I'm still looking forward to where the story will go and how it will improve. Supergirl is obviously not perfect, but we also can't really judge a show by its pilot episode. And thus, with an optimistic attitude, I look forward to episode two! ","6"
"Supergirl",2015-10-05," I just saw the pilot and I think it was OK, besides it's too early to take any conclusion out of it. The acting wasn't neither good or bad, I mean, is the pilot and we all know for The Flash that sometimes TV shows have a rough come out and then they just rise and get better. Let's wait and see if this is the case of Supergirl. They have to make the fight scenes more realistic because they look like overacting when it comes to punches and kicks. More drama and more common sense. SPOILER ALERT!!!!!!!After all those years why didn't Kara know her sister was working for the government?I don't know much about superheroes and stuff, but I wonder why most of them work in journal.

"Supergirl",2015-09-19," How can the writers be so incredibly lazy, stupid, and incompetent? Where in the F did they come up with the the race  Kryptoniese ? WTF??? Really??? Everyone knows that they are  Kryptonian ! Event the spell checker while typing this failed on  Kryptoniese  and passed on  Kryptonian . A few fact checkers need to be fired over this incredibly incompetent blunder! Make the writers watch the actual movies, Smallville, and get their facts straight. It may seem small, but it is not. It stands out really bad when watching it. People should have some basic knowledge of their job, or they should be getting the coffee. There are plenty of fans, or others that could do the job and actually enjoy it and be more accurate. I had to run on and make this thing so much longer because it would not let me post unless it was at least 10 lines. ","7"
"Supergirl",2015-09-14," I liked the pilot. It looks like a series mostly aimed at teenage girls; but that's fine. Every show is aimed at some group of people, so why not them?The series looks cheerful, optimistic and fun. The main character plays the nerd well in my opinion, as well as the heroine, who is at this stage still supposed to be unsure about herself.The villain looked great. If this is the type of enemies we can expect, this series will be great.**SPOILERS BELOW**I do have some questions though.. Like how she didn't know her sister studied alien biology.. how she didn't know she worked for the government. How the government knew all about her yet decided to not do anything until this episode, how they decided to sedate her and put her handcuffs on, only to immediately let her go and give her full support. None of this made any sense. ","7"
"Supergirl",2015-08-27," To corky to dumb comedy, the cast sucked. Everything is just wrong. This is not a superhero show, this is a show if the girl from new girl would get superpowers. Back to the drawing board. I don't have any hope for this.

"Supergirl",2015-08-26," Not the greatest pilot to be honest, the acting is like average and what makes it worse is the writers make it so damn cheesy, I know flash is cheesy but its enjoyable cheesy, where as super girl is not enjoyable, it just gets annoying character development is really rushed in my opinion, the villain was the only good thing about the show, oh and the effects quite superb being a TV show. But all in all Melissa Benoist tries her hardest to give us a great super girl performance but CBS fails to deliver a decent pilot for me to keep coming back for more.Acting- 4/10 Story- 5/10 CGI- 9/10Signing out!

"Supergirl",2015-08-23," Regardless what others may think I am mega excited for this series. We are experiencing and receiving new Superhero shows that were not possible for so many years and we are so long overdue for a female lead superhero show. Not since the Wonder Woman series from the 1970s. I'm glad the producers want to take this down the way of bringing back hope, excitement and adventure into the genre and have said they are fans of the classic Richard Donner Superman movies. Some have said it looks corny but we seem to have forgotten the Flash is corny in many of it''s episodes. Also thought the SFX looked brilliant. Don't understand why many think they were not good. Probably we are too spoiled with SFX in films like Transformers, Godzilla and Avatar. Melissa is simply perfect as Supergirl / Kara she brings to the role what the late Christopher Reeve did in the role. I hope many will give this series a chance and grow to like / love it because I am certainly going to watch it. ","10"
"Supergirl",2015-08-22," i am a dc comics fan, so naturally i was looking forward to watching the pilot episode. after watching all i can say is that this show has done nothing but disappointed me. the characters were so 'unreliable'. the story and the dialogues of the characters of the episode were as if an immature high school teenager has written them. acting was 'eh', so unconvincing. if this is how the rest of the show is going to be then i don't think i would want to see it. there was no spark, no 'kick' in it that make people gluing themselves to the screen. the costumes and weapons look more like that from power rangers i.e., childish and laughable.

"Supergirl",2015-08-13," Kara Zor-El, or Supergirl, is the daughter of Superman's uncle Zor- El and his wife Alura. Due to the fact that Krypton was dying, Kal El (Superman), and Kara Zor-El, were sent away to Earth where they could thrive and survive. Though both were sent so they could live, Kara was also sent to protect Kal-El; however, just as her pod was leaving Krypton's atmosphere, the planet exploded and the shockwave sent her pod off course into the Phantom Zone, a prison dimension used by Kryptonians. This prison dimension was originally discovered by Jor El, Kal El's father, and used by the Kryptonian Council as a humane prison. Although the zone is a barren wasteland, people trapped in the zone cannot grow old or die. As a result of being trapped in the Phantom Zone, Kara arrived at planet Earth several decades later only to discover that her cousin, Kal El, whom she was supposed to protect, was a full grown adult called Superman. After being adopted by the Danvers family, Kara slowly follows into the footsteps of her younger cousin as both a journalist and a Superhero known to the world as Supergirl.Unlike other DC television series that have a darker and violent atmosphere that might be unappealing to some,  Supergirl  is a cheerful, action packed series that is both entertaining and amusing. That being said, it would have been nice if Supergirl's look were a little more modernized to match her appearance in the NEW 52. Although there are a few cheesy moments, Kara's innocent, energetic, quirky, playful personality makes  Supergirl  enjoyable to watch. In the end,  Supergirl  is a fun and interesting series that has excellent potential. That being said, the acting needs some improvement as the cheesiness of the show can sometimes come across as fake, or amateurous. Additionally, the writers as well as the researchers need to get there facts straight as a native citizen of the planet Krypton is a Kryptonian and not a  Kryptoniese . As for those of you disliking it from just the pilot episode, you should examine/recognize this shows potential as there are a lot of amazing TV shows that had a rocky start. ","7"
"Supergirl",2015-08-12," I don't know what happened on the superhero scene , the TV and theater are blowing up with superhero flicks , I wont be speaking about the big screen movies. It seems like the superhero business became very cheap now days , i don't mind every superhero is getting his own show , its just the quality of these shows is getting lower and lower . For me this impression started with  The arrow  through  The flash  and now this super girl bubblegum piece of crap . The bar was set so low that now all you need is a pretty face ,a couple of bad acting supporting roles and some blasting theme. The reason for this phenomena is the greed of the producers , they don't mind crapping on the long loved characters to get some extra money . Sadly this show will last no more than 2 seasons , god i hope they will realize this as soon as possible. I saw the pilot episode and it sucks , looks the same - and i mean the same! as the other super hero TV shows out there . If you want to see pretty face and nothing more than this ones for you.
