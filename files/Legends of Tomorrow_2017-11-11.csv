"Legends of Tomorrow",2017-10-27," I personally love this series, it is wonderful to find out more about other super heroes for a change. If you love sci-fi, great characters, and lots of action and laughs - this is the series for you. If you watch the likes of Killjoys, this will be right up your alley! The way they have personalized each character throughout the series keeps me very entertained, and i am completely hooked! ","10"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2017-10-26," I had a 7 for this show before viewing S03E03, and now I give it a mandatory lowest score 1.It's been on the decline for me towards the end of S02, but season 3 has made social justice issues the driving force in the show. Every episode has an issue, no focus on their powers anymore.Mick's quote in S03E03,  ...because I can smell pigs! , referring to police nearby, was the end of this show for me. Disgusting, and completely irrelevant to the content of this episode, just an inappropriate SJW jab.As with The Flash, these two DC series have failed in an identical manner - soap operas for snowflakes. Gotham...(which keeps getting better, and I've rated an 8)...when these two shows get cancelled, don't let their unemployed writers anywhere your studios! ","1"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2017-10-25," It is provoking to see how various DC shows are cleverly interweaved. However, trying to do a spin-off from so many of them was something I was originally skeptical about. Perhaps the first season did not give sufficient sense of direction, but the second one totally redeemed the show. I had a tense moment at the season two finale, which looked very much like a cut off point. Luckily, the decision to continue the series is highly praised, it is in my views the funniest DC show ever. I really enjoy each episode with very good laughs. The viewers criticising it for the quality of the plot might not realise that it is presumably the perfect parody that this genre was so desperately missing. ","10"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2017-10-24," This shows only reason for being is to be able to tap into the DC comics Library and have little snipets of there characters. Time line stories get boring unless there is a beginning, middle and end. But this jumping around time to fix corrupted time lines is ridiculous already. Are there Not enough writers for the CW shows? I have an idea! cancel Supernatural already and have those writers work on the superhero shows. A few question what happened to the hawks? ( not that I really care they sucked) and Why a black lightning show? P.S. Green arrow is not BATMAN Greg Berlanti! ","3"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2017-10-24," This review is for the directors.I am actually a kind of  comic Hero  addict. I always find time to watch all superhero movie as well as the TV series. But for now, when talking about  the legends of tomorrow , I am not that impressed.In this series, the legends were already there in the other two series (flash and arrow). When their acting is compared I would like to say the characters Mick, captain cold and the professor, their acting is brilliant, that doesn't mean others are bad. I support some of reviews stating about over acting. I too feel the same.I just watched season 3 episode 2. To be frank, the story was good, but the visualization is horrible. Points below,(the listed points are not the climax.) 1. Julies Caesar is brought back to Ancient Rome, and the Rome looks like a forest and are living in some tents which are used by the British and many others in the previous seasons.Could have used some graphics to look better. Another thing is, Rome's mighty Caesar is protected by some countable number of soldiers. GOT fans might not be able to swallow this kind of legendary appearances. 2. Every time the locations are almost same. It is weird to watch the legends whenever they step out of the ship they are always surrounded by some greenery. To be precise from S03E02 the circus field shown does not ring any bells. The place shown is ridiculous. Some nasty cloths will not change the forest into some circus field. Logical part is, every circus will be conducted in some populated area, and here outside those cloths, is greenery and trees.That's all for now. Thank you.... ","5"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2017-10-23," I've been watching The Flash, which I enjoy, and noticed that there was a crossover episode -- titled  Invasion  -- featuring Legends of Tomorrow. I decided to begin watching it. Was I disappointed. Here is my reason for the show being awful and completely abandoning it.The first two episodes was a two-part pilot. It introduces how Rip hunter assembles the Legends. He explains to them about stopping an immortal by the name of Vandal Savage. Also that Rip Hunter's family was killed by Vandal Savage and that he will be the one that kills him. Remember this key piece of information. Vandal Savage is the big bad and Rip wants to kill him. Also , there's a scene where the Legends engage Chronos, the time bounty hunter chasing Rip, and Rip is firing his laser pistol at him. Another key piece of information.During episode 3, everything falls apart for me. The episode opens with Rip Hunter in ancient Egypt with a knife, about to engage Vandal Savage, whom has a staff. Half way through the episode Rip Hunter admits that he had gone back to ancient Egypt, before assembling the Legends, and before the meteor hits which turns Vandal Savage into an immortal. There is a flashback to that scene with Rip Hunter engaging Vandal Savage with a knife. But why? Where's his laser pistol? He could have easily shot Vandal several times in the back, made sure he was dead, and sneak back to a changed future. Nope, he doesn't do that. Anyway, somehow Rip overpowers Vandal, and has his knife at Vandal's throat, but he hesitates. Again, why? Rip knows very well that Vandal murders his family in the future. Rip also knows very well the destruction that Vandal brings onto the world throughout history. Yet Rip hesitates killing him. Of course Vandal's guards arrive and Rip loses his chance at revenge.At this point the entire show breached absurdity for me and went well beyond stupidity, all within the first three episodes. Awful show. ","1"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2017-10-19," This show is even better than the flash right now........Just because of its awful start please don't underestimate this....Season 2 just blew me up and currently it is my favorite DCTV show.. Like arrow season 2 and the flash season 1 it is giving me the chills....It just keeps getting better unlike other DC shows like the flash(don't get me wrong I love the flash but season 3 was not at all for me)or that joke of a superhero show Supergirl.You need to give this show a try....Please just ignore season 1 and focus on the present..I promise you that it will greatly exceed your expectations.This is some really good TV. ","10"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2017-08-28," Negatives: 1. LImited, off the shelf, CGI effects. Nothing creative or mind capturing. Nothing creative in storytelling; same old bad guys. 2. No name actors (low production cost) in roles that don't require acting, but do require that you can say seven monosyllabic words or fewer in succession while giving the appropriate not believable facial response indicating some emotion. 3. Action consists of lots of hand to hand combat so poorly performed even camera angles couldn't rescue the fake punches. Also added were the usual fighting sticks and toy store laser guns. 4. Really bad science (audience probably doesn't care or know better) dealing with time travel as if it were like walking out the door. Even more stupid (er) were things called Time Quakes, Temporal Aberrations, Time Scattering, and Time Drive. The premise is  if I can say it, it must be true.  Wrong! Sorry, time travel, quakes, aberrations, etc. - not possible, all child's fantasy. Positive: 1. You get a bit of history; distorted as each event is. ","2"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2017-08-17," I've never been a big fan of DC, so maybe I have a bias. I can admit that. I like the actors, so I thought there would be some entertainment. Boy was I wrong. It's already a difficult task to write effectively about time travel, but this show just fails at storytelling. It can't make up its mind within the same episode whether it should follow its own rules. If your primary rule as a protector of time is reset the enemy changes, but don't change anything else to prevent paradoxes, then why do they willy-nilly change anything they want EVERY EPISODE with no repercussions? WHY, for the love of god was it necessary to bring Eobard Thawne back?! And the whole premise that they inspired George Lucas and J.R.R. Tolkien... Just no.  So, Lone Starr, now you see that evil will always triumph, because good is dumb.  <U+0097> Dark Helmet, Spaceballs ","1"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2017-08-17," I think the common misconception when being introduced to another CW/arrow universe show (as I was guilty of the same) is that the story will be fleshed out early on since we already know most of these characters. The first couple episodes are unfortunately evoking of this theme as well. But, given time to summon its own, standalone storyline, Legends eventually rivals and even surpasses the other C-dub shows. Without giving spoilers, I can honestly say the time travel gets much better, even more so than the beloved Dr. Who, as we all know how BBC uses ten year-old technology in order to save a dime here and there. The places they travel to are made to come alive with elaborate sets and great wardrobe attire. The characters become more memorable and we even begin to care about several of them once it is expressed that killing someone off is not out of bounds. The show is lighthearted at times, and there hasn't been many cheesy romance arcs akin to Arrow, which is saturated in them. Some of the characters are quite hilarious; while the comical genius of the writers is not anything extraordinary, the acting ability of the great Victor Garber combined with our all-time favorite con men Wentworth Miller and Dominic Purcell left my side splitting on many occasions. To reiterate the theme of this review, the show takes some time to grow on you. The leading man turn of Arthur Darvill (who, by the way, is one of several crossover actors from the Doctor universe, ironically) is not as spectacular as the show needed it to be, but this is of no fault of himself- he simply doesn't have the space captain gravitas of a Patrick Stewart. Like the show, however, he does grow on you and I found myself considering him one of my most beloved characters before season one concluded. Here's hoping season 3 continues to up the ante in terms of Legends finding its groove and continuing to improve. ","9"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2017-08-07," what can I say...the show was average...but just been announced that the produces is introducing a non existent character inn the show that pushes a political agenda...and the guy doesn't hide it...he thinks our president is Mao or Maduro and half US population is like the Red Army or something...nope I'll pass...there where to many Comic book series right now...and good ones....so I'll pass this season. ","2"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2017-07-30," I first gave this show a try because it looked really interesting when I saw the first trailer.But after watching the first episode and so on,it started to feel like the writers are huge doctor who fans and justice league fans and wanted to combine the both to make the legends of tomorrow.The show has a lot of thing that resemble a lot from doctor who like the time masters are like time lords,Vandal Savage seems like the master who is the arch-enemy of the doctor,the ship the legends are on resembles the tardis if the tardis was an actual ship,Rip Hunter seems like a rip-off of the doctor and fun fact, the guy who plays as Rip Hunter actually played as an companion who's name also begins with an r.And most of the characters I used to like from other shows(White Canary,The Atom,Jax/Firestorm,Captain Cold,Heat Wave,and Green Arrow) really annoy me now.So thanks for ruining a bunch of great characters on one show The CW.This is why you(The CW) can only have a soap-opera feeling and it can influence your superhero shows also. ","1"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2017-07-27," A wannabe cross between superheroes and Dr Who. What's wrong? To start off, you have the Atom which is one of the most powerful heroes in the DC universe and he's rarely in his super suit. The team gets into trouble constantly and there the Atom is without his suit. Mainly the characters act stupidly in stupid situations. It is the typical we've got to save the earth situation but somehow it's become a love / human interest story were the mission is the highest priority but somehow that priority is constantly compromised.I will make it to near the end of the first season. At the beginning of the series the time line seems to be important. Now it is out the window. No more checking. Characters that were to be killed are stupidly not killed for contrived reasons. The writers must of just totally given up.Don't waste your time. I'm stuck watching it with my wife to catch glimpses of the former Superman actor. ","2"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2017-07-20," Lazy writing. The only reason I gave this a shot was because of a cross series link - 'Invasion' - part of which was The Flash, Arrow, and then this. Became aware of this in advance and thought I would need to see Legends of Tomorrow for it to make any sense. No - I didn't.'Invasion' didn't need me to have any additional 'Legends' backstory.Then I just thought I may as well finish it - and went on to let it waste more of my time.There are some elements that are worth mentioning, in a positive light - I liked Season 1's enemy, I also liked the lead enemy in Season 2.There are also some better 'Legend' characters in Season 2, swapping out two very tiresome elements from Season 1, being careful about spoilers, but if you've watched it you might know who I'm referring to. Otherwise it's little more than a pile of stinking garbage.The series' play on time travel is so poorly executed, and ill thought out, that I think, in addition to some shoddy dialogue and characters, is the main reason this show has, in my estimation, fallen flat on it's stupid face. ","2"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2017-07-08," Season 1 of Legends of Tomorrow was very average to below average at times, If I had to give it a number it would be about a 6, Savage just didn't do it for me as a villain. Season 2 is much better in every way. I recommend anyone who gave up on it after season 1 to give it one more chance with season 2. ","8"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2017-07-07," I genuinely think that DC's Legends of Tomorrow is underrated. It is a step in the right direction for CW's television universe. The show as a whole brings under-used characters from The Flash and Arrow and gives them a chance to be focused on and developed. The story line in the two seasons can be somewhat confusing, but when made sense of, is very enjoyable and gripping. My personal favourite character is Sara Lance, as she is a strong, a natural born leader and a great captain of the wave rider. She brings order, discipline and a sense of hope to the Legends. I personally believe that Rip Hunter should have played a bigger and more effective role in season 2. Besides all of the positives, there are a couple of negative features that I would like to point out. Some of the acting seems quite stale, as I think that some of the newer members of the cast don't have enough chemistry between themselves. Also, there are minor issues with the CGI used, especially when in the Wave Rider. I personally don't take too much notice of this, but it does sometimes bug me. Besides the few minor criticisms, the program as a whole is great fun to watch and has a story line which will make you want to come back to watch more. ","9"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2017-06-19," Let's be open about  Legends of Tomorrow : Of course the stories are rubbish, and the acting is (with some exceptions) nowhere near Marvel Netflix quality. But this series has something that Arrow (which tries to be incredibly gritty) and Flash (which tries to be incredibly witty) fail to display: Entertainment value! Legends of Tomorrow is like the playground of the Berlantiverse where you can take underused characters or crazy story ideas and make an episode out of it no matter what happened the week before. This is even more so in the second season where the constant need to antagonize Vandal Savage has gone.The writers can send their heroes straight through the ages from feudal Japan to the Wild West, from the 80s to the future. There is an overall storyline but that is not what makes this series fun: What makes it fun is the snappy banter of Snart and Rory, the crazy jumping through time trying to save the timeline while having no qualms causing time paradoxes themselves (constantly!) and not giving a damn about making sense. Doesn't sound like a modern TV show? Well that's because it sounds like a classic comic book, existing just to be enjoyed and to have people have fun with it.Yes, the bogus stories and the crappy acting may turn many people off. But I'll take Legends of Tomorrow over any season of Arrow with its abysmal flashback story lines (and its own crappy acting) anytime. ","7"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2017-06-06," The overall story-line could have been outstanding, unfortunately there are several VERY powerful flaws that detract from the show unlike what was seen in The Green Arrow or The Flash adaptions.1st there is the major flaw which can be found in the shows premises 'time travel'. This would be great, however... it is time travel through the eyes of ignorant liberals; most of the time periods are either greatly exaggerated to the extent that you either you assume that 'that's REALLY how it was...' or you ask yourself 'THAT'S really how it was!?'. From the racist, sexist and homophobic 50s to the vile evil of fascist Nazism in the 1940s.The sad truth is not only will these ideas constantly bombard the audience as they watch the show however, it will also dumb them down with several dozen historical inaccuracies. My favorite of which are Eistein 'inventing the atomic bomb'(correction his wife invented it, truthfully Julius Robert Oppenheimer had more to do with the invention of the atomic bomb than Eistein, who immediately left the project after realizing what its goals were) and men being nothing but sexist pigs in the 1940s (truthfully during these periods men were more or less 'off cuff' when it came to women, however sexual misconduct was still regarded VERY negatively during this time frame and even though women didn't have as many rights as men at the time, men still had a LOT more manners than would be seen going forward into the 1960s-1980s). The best of all though, was the overblown and historically inaccurate conception of the 'Nazis' utilizing idiotic premises like 'Super Nazi'(Like most media, the Nazi's or should i say Germans during WWII are CONSTANTLY portrayed as a inferior force or joke often seen as that 'mustache twirling, top hat wearing, twisted smiling villain, who is tying a women to a set of railroad tracks', oh and apparently their only purpose is for some cocky American dude to punch them out... if you really look at history, MOST of the grunts who fought for Hitler did so out of fear(for their families mostly), not subservient idealism and no opposition force in our history has ever been seen as darkly. even their allies, the Japanese got a better pardon from the US than the Germans did... But hey they did give us anime, video games and edible raw fish). In fact the depiction of the Japanese was even more ridiculous due to their use of 'mixed English' in the entire episode and cultural intolerance.Now apart from the terrible history lesson, there are three other HUGE road blocks that get in the way of this show...1) Narrow-Minded Social/Cultural Intolerance; yeah pretty much the show is watered down by it, everything from woman empowerment through male oppression to pro-gay anti-religious sentiment, if you like watching people frick with other people for their beliefs or exaggerate the truth through embellishment then this show must be pretty awesome for ya lol.2)Pro-Gay Propaganda; So... Vixon is no longer 'bi-curious' she is a full blown homosexual, a point which this show will bring up several dozen times a season (almost annoyingly so...). There is no character that 'randomly' hooks up more than vixen which makes her look not only like a piece of eye candy, but also a total 'skeeze'. As many would find that a bit offensive due to her being a woman expressing sexual liberalism, all she is really doing is solidifying the role that women play as 'sex objects' in society... the worst part is that Vixon is ALSO constantly pushed as a 'role-model' for young women and packaged as a 'strong, confident woman' where she falls flat coming off more like a well... you know.3)Racial Intolerance; although the show features a decently diverse cast... not. Truthfully the show showcases one black male character and two black females (two of which is the results of cultural diversification in comics... (the black firestorm and now a black hawk-girl)). Unfortunately, the black male character seems to ONLY like WHITE chicks... a stereotypical portrayal that dates back to the racially charged times in the good old days. Also sad to say the character is nothing but a running 'look what these crazy white folks are doing now' joke; constantly being thrown into ridiculous situations that 'the white people' got him into.Frankly its these faults that make this show only entertaining to the truly 'braindead' and how it got a second season I will never know. The only thing close to its level of arrogance is 'Team America and The World Police'. ","3"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2017-04-18," Thawn could easily kill every single one of the Legends in a minute but he doesn't. The Legends keep making reckless mistakes, and somehow get out of the situation because the Legion of Doom waits so long to pull the trigger. Like just shoot the damn gun and they will die. Worst show ever. The Legends could have easily saved everyone with one change of the past. So much more is wrong with this show, and the mistakes keep repeating and pilling up every single episode. ","1"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2017-04-17," I have just finished the second season of legends of tomorrow and after a bit of a disappointing first season this season improves on it in every way pretty much every way. The premise of the season sees the team scattered across time as with some new help look to stop a group of super villains from capturing an artefact called the spear of destiny. caity lotz reprises her role as Sara lance and she really becomes the main character and captain of the team and I thought she did a really good job. Her character has to deal with some emotional moments due to previous events and it truly does hit when it is meant to. Dominic Purcell as mick Rory is given a larger role this season and similar to Sara he has a hard time dealing with something that happened last season and I found him the funniest and one of the most interesting characters on this show. The returning cast of ray, martin, Jefferson and rip are all still good characters. The new heroes are Nate Haywood/steel and amaya/vixen, I liked both of these characters. At first I thought Nate was a bit over the top and cheesy but he grew on me as the season progresses. Now to the villains, reprising his role from the flash matt letscher is eobard thawne/reverse flash and he is great. He totally sells the role and I have always loved his character and I feel like he was the perfect villain for this season. Also I find Neal McDonough as Damien darkh incredibly entertaining and I really liked watching him. My only negative might be that I feel like John barrowman as Malcolm merlyn is entertaining but ultimately underutilised towards the end of the season. The story of the show moves across more interesting time periods and I just found the characters story arcs more interesting especially as the show progresses. I will say that if you haven't watched all of arrow and the flash then you will be lost especially when it comes to the villains as there motivations are linked to the other shows but for fans it really does work. The script of this show has some decent dramatic qualities that work better then last season and the humour is better, it just does come across as really cheesy at times which does hurt the show. The style of the show has some pretty good action scenes especially when it embraces its more sci fi routes. But this season similar to the first does have episodes that feel like filler for sure. Overall this is one of the best improvements to a series that I have seen and I recommend this season especially if you are a fan of the other shows in this universe. ","8"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2017-04-16," Second season is for me a 9 it is funny and creative. Season 1 was a 6, I mean better than the other TV shows in this universe, but the whole Hawk girl - Vandal Savage story line was awfully boring. They also completely ruined Hawkgirl who was actually a cool character. With them gone though and with the emergence of Sarah as a leader and the team making mistakes and learning along the way season two was really fun to watch. From Rory's obsession with ninja's in medieval japan to 1980s via the zombie confederates and Camelot....My favourite character is Rory  less talking, more doing!  :) ","9"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2017-04-15," I don't know...I was expecting more, but it didn't hit home at all for me.1. Sara Lance - Her character is all over the place. They made her a captain to make the hard decisions, when in reality all the decisions made were either ad-hoc or by reasonable deduction. Sara was always a solo mindset. I don't see how going from the League of Assassins qualifies you to run a ship that jumps time-lines effectively. That role should have gone to another crew member. You never see her strength as a leader. There were actually times Amaya had much better leader abilities than Sara. And Sara seemed bent on making out with every woman she came across no matter what time period they were in. Sloppy touch. Her actions alone could have compromised several missions. Not the signs of a true leader at all.2. Dr. Stein - Far too many times they make him seem indecisive. I found that hard to watch when in Season 1 he was relied upon heavily to help Jackson get acclimated to his new role and powers...only for now in Season 2 he always struggles within himself. 3. Jeffrey Jackson - I have no complaints with his role in the LOT other than he overdoes it...and a lot! They write his character abrasive in many shows, then they soften him up, then they give him credit for making the hard call...it's dysfunctional at best. 4. Ray Palmer - of all the LOT'ers,I like him the most. He should have been the leader IMO. He ran a huge company back in Star City, had incentive to correct the time-line the most, but they totally watered down his influence on the show to fit in Sara being captain. Ray has a bit of it all, smarts, decision-making, knowledge, camaraderie, if anyone was fit to gel a team, it was Ray. Missed opportunity for the former Superman to have a lead again...lol5. Mick Rory - Mick has to be the best character of all. He is true to himself, he had THEE best character development of them ALL! You understood his position going back to making him Chronos, getting back to the team, having struggles with Snart, leaving and coming back. Mick was my hero the entire show and his character was the beefiest, most developed of them all IMO.6. Nate Haywood - He actually was a refreshing addition to LOT. He came in with a solid story-line that was maintained the entire season 2. He hit all his marks in terms of his love of history, his grandfather, wanting to address a past he wasn't happy about, but the journey helped him figure out what was more important...and that's all you can expect for guy who inherits superpowers but exudes a real heart. His character was worth the watch.7. Amaya Jiwe - SO underused! This girl's character was a frickin powder keg ready to explode! But every time you'd think they'd write in for her to be a badass? They hand it over to..of course, Sara...and Amaya proved she could make much better decisions than Sara along the way. That was very irritating to watch. I like how the love interest between her and Nate was developed. It would have been nice if she had a chance to actually MEET her granddaughter since everyone else saw their past or future in some manner or another...but oh well. 8. Gideon - I think it was wrong for them to materialize Gideon and give her a smack-a-roo session with Rip IMO, but it was nice to see Amy appear on the show. The ONLY 2 things I don't like about how they have Gideon in the show is:1. The way Gideon talks - a little loud and hard to the ear (sometimes I'd have to turn my system down Gideon was so loud, but that was purposed by the producers) and 2. overly-human responses to the team throughout the show kills the tech portion of it.9. Rip Hunter - I liked Rip Hunter's character and wished they had more of him as his old self. But to have him under the influence of the Legion of Doom shouldn't have been as long as it was IMO. And they always found a way to make characters rationalize being on the bad side...it's kind of funny because it's so predictable in film now it gets boring. Though a snooze factor, I enjoyed him throughout Season 2, if not one of the most watchable of all the characters. I do, however, hate how they ended the show. Rip only talks to Sara as he leaves the ship. This is what you do for the most pivotal character of the show? He started with a bang, but end his character with a wimp? Not cool at all. The emotional attachment to Gideon alone deserved a much different ending!10. Legion of Doom - These guys were awesome. End of story. But, the way the story-line flowed was a bit irritating, and that's on the writers, not the actors themselves. But this lineup is a powerhouse and it's hard to watch really good actors playing bad guys go against really bad actors as good guys...well, not all of LOT, but...Other than that, I think I want to watch Season 1 again to remind me why I like this show because I almost stopped watching it once Sara became captain.

"Legends of Tomorrow",2017-04-10," #Season01The show had potential, then lost it and now it ends with new potential. Still better than #Arrow's Season 04 by a wide margin.Basically, an entire season where very little happened in terms of the chronological events in the time-line. And very little good was done. The show was slow, filled with cheesy dialogues and a constant splitting of team which led to more trouble for the team.Then, there was this #AncientEgypt mythology which was the centre for the show. Which caused huge discomfort for the #ComicBook origins. Instead of #Hawkgirl and #Hawkman being aliens who are never in love as in comics and don't get reborn, and instead #VandalSavage being a #Caveman gained #Immortality from #Meteor. It was all the wrong way, which led to a weak character portrayal of #Hawkgirl being the centre and key piece.In the end, it was relieving to see that the show has distanced themselves from this wrong #Mythology as even the ending episodes had contradicted their earlier established story arcs. But, as the ending was near, the show got good, focusing on wrapping up this wrong path of start and now there is potential once again for #Season02, if there is one.One of the key gems of the show, was the lush costumes and set designing and visual effects for a TV show, which led to the show being helped in being held on just long enough to establish itself properly.#Season02After a very confused and mangled #Season01, the show has risen from the ashes to deliver a very fun, exciting and humor-filled season, that turned out to be the best of the #DC #TVshows on air, even better than #TheFlash.One of the reasons of its #Success, was simply the use of the best charismatic characters of the #ArrowVerse to deliver a dynamic team of villains that really put a whole other level of #Beat on the show, that the other #DCshows are missing (#excluding #Flash's 1st #Season).The show maintained a really good balance of Dark characters and the theme of the show, which is that of a cheerful adventure. But the show never forgot that in the end, the story is dark and the stakes are very much fatal for the #Protagonists.Even the #VisualEffects were pretty good this season, and they had to be, as #ReverseFlash's involvement and his grand scheme demanded them to be. The most memorable things this season, were the blurring of lines between different #Genres in reality, involving the use of #StarWars and #TheHobbit.Overall, the show was fun and had enough cheesiness in it, to be always being able to deliver #Entertainment, but the show did employ the use of #CommutativeLaw a lot, especially in the end, but it never became too #Goofy. One more amazing thing, was the proper build-up of the story, character arcs and their ends, which only enhanced the story. The most styled character, this show made us realise, was #WhiteCanary, with impressively #Choreographed fight sequences and #BattlePoses, that slayed many #Hearts.In the end, a very much recommended show, because of a very entertaining season 02.

"Legends of Tomorrow",2017-04-04," That's the only time I can watch it. Saturday morning while I'm reading the news. Just too juvenile for prime time viewing. If you like Arrow, The Flash, and Supergirl you should like this. They're all the same live action cartoon type of show. With time travel and alternate universes available, I find Legends and The Flash at least worthy of halfway watching, although just barely. ","4"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2017-03-31," This is beyond my imagination. Worst Sh#t made by DC. Like seriously ??? what were they thinking ??? After Arrow and Flash, this is just disappointment. I have wasted my time watching 3 episodes. My expectation was high, but this is a complete sh*t. If you can't make something good then don't make shows like this. And I don't know how on earth it got 7+ rating. ","1"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2017-03-30," This could have been good except that the story line was ridiculous and the actors mainly miscast.As others have said the main story makes no sense. A rogue time traveller, (so badly cast he was unwatchable most of the time. Arthur Darvill just has zero screen presence and no charisma whatsoever. Who decided to cast him in this?) decides to gather a group of super heroes to help him kill an immortal who has killed his wife and child. Why he didn't just time travel to just before they were killed and take them elsewhere or to a different time is not explained. The group he picks including two criminals with no super powers are all pretty weak and seem incapable of killing this one evil being.As the series moves on it becomes more and more frustrating and errors and plot holes abound.The only thing that made this watchable was the special effects were pretty good, but that is about it. ","2"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2017-03-22," I have somewhat enjoyed this show, however it has in the last half season been on a religious kick that is making it near unwatchable. The constant references to religious characters and religious ideology make it seem like it is being written not by a fan of comics, but someone trying to push a theocratic agenda under the guised of a TV show. I do realize that religion is fiction in and of itself, but if I wanted to watch my childhood heroes spewing ideological nonsense I would watch a Kirk Cameron movie. ","5"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2017-03-21," People! Give it a break! This show never fails to make me laugh! It's ridiculous, cheesy and a ton of fun. Suspend reality and enjoy the ride- this is not meant for heavy thinking, deep romances or for pondering your role in life. It's fun. The humor is the truly captivating part. You never know where or when it's going to come from, but this show is a hoot- as long as you don't take yourself too seriously. I suggest giving it a try- I think this show has earned it. ","8"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2017-03-18," I'm rating this 7 stars because I enjoy the show very much, but think it can be even better. There is room for improvement, but I will not say it's a terrible show with bad acting and poor writing, because that is not true.I've watched since episode one and I have only missed two episodes of the current season, so I think it's fair I write a review. Those that wrote a review based on watching only one episode from the first season have truly missed out!The action and time travel are the best parts of the show, but I think the character development is the second best. We have seen the characters change over time (no pun intended!). Season 1 felt like more of an experiment, but this season feels like real growth. I want this series to continue because I need more! ","7"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2017-03-11," It's not at all good. But, yeah, I'm still watching it because I'm a sucker for time travel stories. Part of it stems from being an historian, and part of it stems from heavily influential childhood sci-fi shows and......so long as they keep leaping from life to life, striving to put right what once went wrong and hoping each leap will...Yeah, yeah, yeah. It's time travel and good or bad I'm going to be in its audience just because of that.This is why I want the return of the message boards. I mean, how else am I going to find out if Wentworth Miller is obscenely over-acting or if that annoying delivery is just how he talks in real life? I certainly don't care enough to explore it much further than this.Did they get sued by the creators of Dr. Who because of Arthur Darvill's depiction of Rip? It seems almost too Dr. Who not have a lawsuit over it.Dominic Purcell, the mystery returns, is he really over-acting that much or is his delivery just as naturally annoying as Miller's? Brandon Routh...really dude, you look a little too much like you belong in  Sliders  but that's not your fault.Caity Lotz is really the only one here that is believably in the Arrowverse. She doesn't seem like a cartoon villain and she doesn't seem like she's ripped out of the pages of another series.I know, I know...Ciara Renée...and again she would have been great in Sliders...but not so much here.There is a lot wrong with it but...Time travel...going to keep watching it anyway and overlook all the over-acting and the bits and pieces blatantly ripped out of Classic sci-fi. ","3"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-11-07," I really tried to like this series after seeing the pretty high reviews. After watching Season 1 I saw things starting to take shape and characters developing with Leonard Snart ending up one of the most fleshed out ones. Season 2 doesn't seem to build on Season 1.The stories seem to follow the same formula. Travel through time. Screw something up with ineptitude. Scramble to fix what they screwed up. Lather, rinse, repeat.Why is it that shows featuring DC characters can not be nearly as well written as their Marvel counterparts? Even the NetFlix hosted ones. Hopefully Wonder Woman will be better than Suicide Squad. ","3"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-10-18," Quite possibly the most pointless TV series I've ever had the misfortune of sticking with. A poor man's dr. Who gathers up some cheap rip offs of decent characters to go back in time to eliminate an immortal that killed his family so far in the future it has literally no affect on anyone recruited by him, giving them no reason to go in the first place. Armed with a ridiculous laser revolver that he somehow manages to miss every shot he takes with, this plonker bumbles through time damaging the time line more and more to the point that he ends up 3 days before his family dies taking on savage then(nullifying the entire premise of the  show ) only to again hilariously fail! Want a tip? Don't recruit anyone, go back to a time before savage is immortal/ still a defenceless baby, carry said baby forward through time till you can find a 2x2 box for said baby to rot for all eternity, and call it a day.

"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-10-04," Oh Rory! The Doctor really left you somewhere surreal! Love superhero stuff but this is so poor. Don't really have anything good to say about it, Poor acting, poor script, poor effects. Arrow started out brilliantly and soon lost the way as it progressed Flash is also losing its way Then you get the Flash/ Arrow crossovers - blink an eye in either series and lose the plot So now we throw them all together along with the baddies and one of Dr Who's lost companions! Sorry, I'm off to watch SHIELD, Supergirl, Agent Carter and of course the Doctor ! Arthur Darvill is such a let down and wrongly cast On a whole - it's just shallow, cheesy and weak! ","1"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-10-02," The first season of this show is so bad that it is hard to know where to begin. It feels like a low-budget series from the 1970's, and not in a time-traveling kind of a way, but rather how the special effects and story-telling goes.The first season is bad on a whole new level. Crap beyond crap.The second season though has been decently entertaining so far - in the same way paint suddenly drying faster is more entertaining then slow drying paint. The acting has got significantly better and it is almost fun to watch. Almost. I changed my previous rating from a 1 to a 2 just because it has improved a lot from the first season. The show is still bad, very low budget and not very good scripting, but at least it is almost watchable in the 2nd season.In general though; nothing really makes sense, the acting is abysmal (1st season especially), the scripts horrible. Why was this crap even created? Who thought that this was a good idea? With the Flash now being one of the worst things on TV, and albeit a good try to rejuvenate Arrow that show too is (still) really bad, I believe that DC should keep to cartoons where they are great and close down these shows which are only embarrassing.Do not watch, and if you do; watch the first episode of the first season, then jump directly to the 2nd season, or you can lobotomize yourself first with a rusty nail which may bring some enjoyment.

"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-09-29," Focuses on time-traveling rogue Rip Hunter, who has to recruit a rag-tag team of heroes and villains to help prevent an apocalypse that could impact not only Earth, but all of time. DC's Legends of Tomorrow suffers from what i can say poor storytelling and over the top acting and with a team of people that simply can't work together that well. My biggest issue with the whole TV show is Dominic Purcell and Wentworth Miller and although they're not bad their characters are just getting boring always arguing and doing the wrong things every single time another huge problem is this whole thing with Casper Crump who plays Randy Savage his role reminds me something like Ultron and Trevor he is supposed to be powerful and all that and yet he gets killed every 10 years and comes back again and this whole time travel thing kinda gets old as well. I stopped watching around episode 6 and i really don't see myself continuing again after all those things i saw every episode is the same jokes, cgi, action and time travel and let's not forget arguments between the same 2 characters. It started pretty well and the cast is fine but after the 1st episode it's getting boring and you will get tired for sure 6.5/10 ","6"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-09-25," Just watched the pilot and it did not kick ass or make me want to see episode 2 immediately. Filming and CGI was OK for a series, though with only little effort it would have looked even better. The Waverider ship design looks terrible, the surface textures seem to come from a ten years old pc game. Costumes are OK to badly done, Atoms armor being the best of all. The writing is simple and neither smart nor very entertaining. I have no idea whether the plot is based on comics (I assume it is), nevertheless it can't be a jewel of comics art writing. The names are awful (Rip Hunter, Vandal Who?), the character design and looks are from the stone age. The dialogues follow the same route - a lot of blah blah (the evil super dork even talks to his foot soldiers about his plans, oh my).So actually nothing in this show seems to be non-cliché, which is quite boring. Studios and producers don't have the balls to make a show from comics like DV8. All they dare to do is gulp up the next offspring of already running and successful shows that can be shown at 18.00 and don't offend anyone.Too tame, too botched, too flat.Edit: OK, I did it and watched episodes 2-4. At least I tried, I had to fast forward a lot to omit terrible lengthy dialogue leading nowhere. This series is awful and so badly done that it's actually an insult. I vote down to 1 star now.This is just the tip of the iceberg but here are some major flaws from episode 4 (no spoiler intended):- The bad guys flees into the Soviet Union, the team has no clue where exactly he is hiding in that oh so tiny empire made up from some of the largest countries in the entire world - yet the captain orders the ship to take course into the UDSSR and then suddenly without explanation it's Moscow, what else...The ship falls at a rate of 1000m per second and can still make a flat crash landing without anyone aboard getting injured. We clearly see the ship is not moving vertically when it cuts the engines. That means it's initial velocity is 0. It is shown to fall for about 4-5 seconds only from a height of 5000m, which means it would reach a final speed of about 50m/s ignoring the fact that the air friction and the non-aerodynamical form of the object would slow it even further down. Crashing into the ground with several hundred tons of mass at a speed of let's say 30-40m/s would still not be healthy to ship and crew. But - funny - when they reach the surface the engines are on and the ship is flying horizontally at great speed and still crash landing. We see the ship can easily spiral straight into the sky several times at ease, only this time it can't counter th terrible acceleration of 30 m/s to stabilize it's flight? This is big BS in your face.Rip Hunter is the most annoying character I have seen in years. Whatever nonsense he utters it always makes him look like a total idiot. He is a Time Master. How did such an immature, unstable and short-sighted man ever become a Time Master?The glowing handguns that make the wearer a big target while sneaking through the dark forest... and they look like what they are: cheap plastic toy guns. And they have zero reach, too. Yet Snort and his  I always have this sinister expression  friend fire at ranges where they clearly can not hit anything. Doesn't stop them from trying and taking bullets from AK47s as a reward.Using an audio mixpanel as controls for a pseudo-scientific installation. One that houses a massive radioactive source in a chamber with glass windows. The chamber could at least have been filled with water, but no.And every episode a lot of talk, talk, talk. Nonsense. Insulting. Miserable.It got nominated for the Best TV Comic Adapation - this industry is so dumb and rotten. ","1"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-08-26," I'm not sure what demographic this show is actually aimed at. There's blood, killing, and death, so I assume it's for a double digit age demographic.The problem here is, the show is beyond shallow. The characters are all mentally inept, and the writing is terrible. I won't even get into the plot holes.I think my growing distaste for the show finally reached the boiling point with the big countdown box with a BUTTON, magically appearing on a nuke being sold at auction.This show was written by 5 year olds, for 5 year olds. Which wouldn't be that bad, if the blood and violence wasn't there. Hence my confusion as to whom this show is aimed at.Having just watched the first episode of 'The Tick', that show is Shakespeare compared to this Barney and Friends.My teenage daughter is barely able to watch this. I'm trying to find excuses not to watch this.About the only redeeming quality here is the budget. There's some OK fighting and shooting. If there wasn't, I would have stopped watching after the 2nd episode. ","2"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-08-24," In my complete honest opinion as a comic book fan of DC and Marvel I must truly say that this show is just legendary ha-ha. In other words it is really good and pretty funny. DC fans and followers of The Arrow and The Flash will most definitely enjoy this show because it does have great connections and relations to DC's Arrow and The Flash TV series. Almost the whole cast of this show made their comic book TV series debut firstly on The Arrow then The Flash. Even with out watching Arrow and The Flash true comic book fans would totally enjoy this show. The humour and action is just bad ass. We are all very familiar with Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman and many popular famous faces of The DC comics industry, but not so many are familiar with The Atom, The White Canary, Fire Storm, Captain Cold, Heat Wave, Hawk Man, Hawk Girl, and Rip Hunter. To some you may be quite familiar with these characters but to most they are just seeing these heroes for the very 1st time on the big screen. I like the fact new characters are being introduced to the DC TV universe. There is nothing better then expanding the world of comics. Like I said before if you have watched Arrow and The Flash you definitely will have more of a deeper connection to these characters as you have seen them way before this show was put together and made into a TV series. However to those who have not watched the previous TV series do not get discouraged. This show was made for those familiar with the previous TV shows but it was also definitely made for new viewers who don't even got a clue about DC or the superheroes involved in the TV series. I have gotten many of my friends and family to watch this show and they have no clue where these characters originate from. Proving that this show is for everyone not just hard core comic book fans. The action and comedy alone makes this show what it is, but there are definitely some touchy moments where you do feel sympathy for some characters and begin to develop an emotional attachment to them. Overall I strongly suggest you make some popcorn grab a cold drink, sit back and enjoy the show. You wont be disappointed :) ","10"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-08-24," I tortured myself all the way through the 16 episodes of the first season.I had quite high expectations starting this but as soon as i saw the first characters from  Arrow  my expectations dropped by a large margin.The concept is great (just like the concept of  Arrow ) but those writers (haven't checked, but it feels like Arrow and Legends of Tomorrow share the same writers team) have a talent to absolutely destroy promising concepts.Let me try to summarize an episode(totally spoiler-free!) :Intro - new threat out of nowhere - plot twist in the main-story - hilarious fights including bad CGI - plot twist new fancy equipment/ability with ridiculous name is (re-)discovered / invented - stupid decisions! - plot twist - FEELINGS, kiss, kiss - final fight - plot twist/cliff hanger! - CreditsThis combined with a cast of actors that barely deserve the label  actor  makes this show an impertinence for the average viewer!My advice: Keep your hands off this. Total disappointment! ","3"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-07-11," My first ever review and I really wanted it to be a good one but this show just plain boring and mediocre at best.The teaser trailer was much better than the actual thing I must admit. The cast is still good; Brandon Routh could be a little less cheesy in my opinion, Wentworth Miller and Dominic Purcell are a good as can be expected, Arthur Darvill is OK. Honestly, the show could have used a lesser antagonist. That being said I won't be giving up on this show yet. Maybe not expect much from it like I did but I am gonna wait and see nevertheless. Giving it a 5 out of love of the DC characters. ","5"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-06-26," I was pretty disappointed with the show to say the least. Granted, I've only seen the first half of the season and I'm told that the last couple of episodes do pick up, but from a critical perspective the show doesn't deliver. Legends of Tomorrow had a great opportunity to be amazing: it's actors are great, in particular Wentworth Miller, Victor Garber and Brandon Routh have all proved their skills as actors, and the show held great potential with the epic stories and histories attached to the characters. However, the show's writing and overall direction doesn't offer anything new or particularly interesting to the superhero genre. Instead, the show falls under clichéd story lines and dialogue without a strong enough villain or a convincingly written character for Rip Hunter to hook a viewer. I found the show's visual direction to be nothing special either - watching the show you can really tell that any hope of a visually appealing or unique show is squandered by the show's low budget and the pressure to churn out episodes for a network.However on a positive note, the show is pretty light-hearted and I'm sure will probably entertain a fan of the Berlanti-verse looking for a marathon. Wentworth Miller's performance as Leonard Snart is one of the best things about the show, and the chemistry between the cast is what you should stay for. Overall rating: C+ ","6"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-06-16," Season one dealt with Rip Hunter, the time master, trying to eliminate Vandal Savage, who murdered Rip's wife and son.I think this story line went on too long, but the writers wisely gave it a conclusion in the season finale.Now for the characters, it is just hard to like the Hunter character, though they tried to make him sympathetic. The Kendra and Carter characters just slowed the story and were somewhat silly. Their departure was a good thing at the end.The Atom is very likable and reminds you of Christopher Reeves. Also, Professor Stein is good. Snart and Mick also are good characters, too bad the writers killed Snart, bad move.About Jefferson, the writers need to develop his personality. At this point, it's almost a generic one.Though I am not enthusiastic about season one, I think the second one will be worth checking out. Sometimes a series does not hit its stride until later.

"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-06-14," No,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no,no........Please don't waist your time!I would rather sit and watch paint dry than watch this BS.This show had to be the worst show I've watched so far. Its EXTREMELY predictable!!!I Don't THINK THIS IS A SPOILER ALERT but I checked the damn box anyway.I've watched 5 episodes. And in every episode they came face to face with the one person they were suppose to kill but for some reason or another they cant kill him!!! They don't try to capture him and hold him till they can kill him but they decide to let he get away and they'll just get him next time. GTFOH!!!!!Pure BS!! ","2"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-06-13," This show had a lot of potential since it's release as it was the concept of bringing JUSTICE LEAGUE in the T.V. The pilot was very interesting when we get introduced to the characters and RIP HUNTER tells them that they are not heroes,they are legends.But,as soon as the show progressed it lost its momentum and the episodes started to be boring and dull.The plot was getting repetitive and had nothing new to show the viewers{Except for the VFX}Luckily, this show was again back on its track from episode 9 as they addressed the real threat!PROS +Decent cast +Arthur Darvill's RIP +Purcell and Millers thrilling performance +VFX +A tragic end for Captain Cold +The establishment of JUSTICE SOCIETY in the finaleCONS -Was boring from episode 3 to 8-Hawkman/Hawkgirl story arc-Vandal Savage was not so terrifying Overall:It is a good show but it still has a lot of flaws. It's a must watch for those who are looking for extraordinary action on the small screen.My Rating- 9/10 ","9"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-05-28," I was very excited about this show; I loved the preview trailer and made sure to watch the lead up episodes of The Flash and Arrow before the premiere.A new show with some of my favourite characters from the DCTV Universe <U+0096> what could go wrong?EVERYTHING!I do have to congratulate Legends of Tomorrow on making probably one of my most hated characters from any movie or TV show I've ever watched!Rip Hunter is a d*ck; he lies, omits the truth, willing to sacrifice any and all of these characters at the drop of a hat, right up to the second to last episode, is a horrible leader and is so narrowly focused that it, more often than not, lead to mistakes and even worse, in some cases during the season, their mistakes would actually lead to teaching and helping the enemy.Throughout the season it got to a point where the relationships on that ship was like a yoyo; one episode they're friends and the next they hate each other and will leave someone behind. One episode Person A and Person B will be the best of friends and then the next they are enemies. Now repeat this over and over.Another thing that got repetitive over the season was the constant reminder that after every trip through time, the crew will suffer things like blindness, loss of hearing, vertigo and more but every time it happens everyone is 'Oh my god what's happening.' 'Oh yeah that's a result of jumping through time.'I found this hard to watch most of time, I would watch an episode a week and by the time the next came around, I wouldn't want to watch it but if I left it for two or three episode in a group, I like it even less.The only highlights of this show is the costumes and set designs for the time periods but also Sara Lance and Martin Stein, who are always amazing in every episode. More often that not, Victor Garber would always steal the focus.I did like how some characters grew, namely Mick/Heatwave, who was just the dumb muscle but has now been given a better storyline and character. On the flipside is Kendra Saunders/Hawkgirl, who started off with so much potential starting with her appearance on The Flash and the beginning of the show but when we got to the end, she had become kind of useless and one dimensional.At the moment, I'm really torn whether I will be watching the second season. ","5"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-05-27," I tried it out but I stopped maybe 4 or 5 episodes before the finale. I just couldn't take it anymore. I understand that heroes have to make bad decisions for the sake of drama, and character development, and so the show will go on, but it's just stupid, unexplained decision after stupid, unexplained decision with this one. They keep making the same mistakes over and over and giving in to emotional plot holes even after the importance of keeping the mission in mind has already been established. At this point it even seems like they are literally making combat decisions for budget reasons. 'We can't afford firestorm this week, so make sure those two get separated.' For me the last straw was SPOILER - The episode where they know where Vandal Savage lives in the 50's, and their plan is for Kendra to sneak in and stab him in the back. They've had at least 4 fights against this guy, they know that he knows that time travelers are hunting him, they know Kendra is no match for him, they know that Firestorm or Atom would be able to incapacitate him allowing Kendra to finish him off, but because Kendra has a tantrum when Atom tries to say it's a bad idea, the entire team gets behind what has to be the worst plan they've ever had and lose the one item that gave them a chance at completing their goal. The outcome was obvious and they tried to hide the fact that no one brought up a reasonable complaint with what I can only assume was supposed to be character development.All in all, you might want to spare yourself the trouble and go watch Gotham or The Flash instead.

"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-05-22," Mindless, thoughtless waste of time. I'm not even sure if it can be classified as entertainment. It is Dumb with a capital ADHD. This not science fiction since there is ZERO logic or even a coherent flow idiocy. Who in a right mind will believe 12y/o kids were allowed to drink alcohol in USSR?! I can't find anything positive to say about this show and I've watched some horrible shows before. I'm bewildered how this awful thing got such high rating. Literally nothing good about it. It is awful. If you need to punish your children, make them watch this show. However I fear it might be classified as child abuse. Horrible, horrible show. ","1"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-05-20," Hey, you remember how fire actually burns stuff or ice guns you know, freeze things? Well, not here buddy. Captain Cold and Heatwave apparently got some magical guns that shoot fire and ice that just kinda shove people around. I mean, it's a level of suspended belief that I just can't go to.This show emphasizes best the flaws of otherwise goods shows like Arrow and The Flash have combined. Pointless pathetic drama, over-enthusiastic camera work, nonsensical plots.One thing it has going for it are already fleshed out and familiar characters combined with some good actors. Dynamics of the group is A-OK. That and you have to admire a little at least about what they're trying to do on TV. It's ambitious at least.But then comes the plot, oh the plot. Paper thin plot that when you think about it even a little makes no damn sense and it's a mess from beginning to the end. Rip wants to do this and that, everybody says he can't, but the rules of time are whatever you want them to be, but they are actually not, or are they... and so on. For a Time Master, he should know a little bit better how time works and give at least some basic rules and not change them every damn time the plot writes itself into a corner. Which happens in almost every episode.For a TV show that has time travel as one of the main plot points, Legends of Tomorrow really don't know how to use that and have fun with it. At least some semblance of logic and structure of the show would be nice. But as of now, plots and subplots and main themes almost always contradict themselves over some basic logic. That's probably best illustrated through Rip's plan which is... well it's a mess and I even don't know where to start. He wants to save his family and wants to kill Savage, but he can't, so they travel through time to do some convoluted things just because?! It's hard to explain. Most of the time when you watch this you ask  Huh, OK, but what's the plan here exactly again? What's going on and why? . They just do stuff and stuff just happens, there's no reason, no stakes, no depth. One other thing that drives me crazy, and it came from Arrow but on steroids, is overenthusiastic masturbatory camera work. Camera never stops, never. It always moves, pans doing some impossible shots. In process ruining fights, great dramatic scenes and makes everything look cheaper as well. Just chillax camera dude. Still shots and simple but smart moving shots can sometimes work wonders, we don't have to pan in through every warehouse dressed up as hangar/lair/abandoned warehouse/industrial plant/factory/sci-fi big room/core/place where they fight/etc. Leave the camera crane and dolly out sometimes, please. Because of it, fights look massively choreographed, devoid of any  punch  in them. Maybe season two will get better or maybe it'll get cancelled, who knows. As it stands now, this show needs some more direction and way tighter and coherent plot.UPDATE SEASON 2: mostly the same mess as S1, some things got better - story arcs, characters, some worse - fire and ice still don't work like they should, plot writing itself into corner. And then there's the final episode of the season that is just infuriating - even in  Previously on Legends  part in this same episode they say something like  We can change time with a timeship, but not reality from the spear. . And then they do just that, change reality with a timeship. WTF FFS FOLLOW YOUR OWN RULES, SHOW! Goddamit. ","5"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-05-17," 5 is the vote, and not lower, only because it's clear that this project was meant to be important, because i think it's not a low budget, and then because i'm quite passionate about fantasy and sci-fi movies/series...the actor that plays  rip hunter  is a little meaningless, i don't what is the exact term in English,. in italy we say  insignificante ...it means he has no appeal at all... in my honest opinion a simple switch, change, with Wentworth Miller as Rip Hunter and otherwise, would just have been easy and successfuldialogues, script, as other users said, are ...i don't know how to say...childish, stupid purcell is not bad, maybe for the first time ","5"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-05-16," Well I watch the series, as well as Arrow. Arrow season 1 is better than LoT, obviously. I hope season 2 may repair the rating. Well, Vandal Savage is known as not so fearful, due to his  ape and bearded appearance . However, Vandal's powers is not fire shooting, making rain or thunderbolts... he is a manipulator firstly, and then an immortal by thanks to the events of the past. Vandal first appeared as a weapon-merchant, later he will be a soviet supporter, dictator, mentor of the young Degaton. In the climax of the events, Vandal appeared as a nearly anti-hero, the Timemasters thinks that he can save Earth from the winged-aliens. (Thanachar, maybe...) However, the Oculus which shows more than it previously mentioned is defeated by Rip Hunter and the crew in order to prevent the Time Masters to see their will. (logical, maybe) Future can be changed, one of the cliché-themed messages of the story. Raymond not died, but Snart maybe, in order to save Sara Lance and Mick. By tricking the events, Vandal is able to return 2166, where he kill Jonas and Miranda. Question: In the beginning, he walk off from that ship with Kendra? :D Time travel is always a risky thing. Rip Hunter: - Rip is a commoner, if I contrast him to Arrow, Quentin Lance or John Diggle, yet he is likable with his wits and his outbursts. He however should be more careful. His past story is interesting somehow, as how a thief become Time Master. (hooo... criminal became cop cliché?) The safe house with the young time masters also interesting, as was I surprised as child Rip Hunter (Michael) kills the Pilgrim. Woo... the hunters sent by the Time Masters before Pilgrim is a group of totally freaks. Atom is better than in Arrow season 3, he seems to be kind, brave, smart and cooperative. Firstly, I though he is related somehow Vandal Savage secretly, just thought what a great turn it is. Look: Well, Ray succeeds where Vandal not. If he already know about time travel, or he is just a little smart, he might travel back to tell past Vandal about his errors. He is however a psycho, so I do not know. Felicity is wrong, even her small cameo! Kendra is fair... however, I do not know about this relationship with Carter. I mean, it is destined to choose him always? Why? Because he is brave, has a fine jaw or sensible in a cliché level? Bring him back is disaster, he should remained dead, without him Kendra may kill Vandal with the mace or they just repeat the traveling to Egypt, where Vandal is an adolescent. But what if Vandal cloned himself? Many-many possible subplot. Carter - You have to remained to dead, for the betterment of the story, sorry. Snart - Most shrewd member, his theft jokes is always make me smile. However, he is compassionate, brave and selfless, he even show grace against Mick. Mick - The most interesting one, he is a dumb, aggressive enforcer by first sight. But he is a pyromaniac, low-cunning and headstrong man, his life as Kronos grows his cunning and will, he resist the torture second time, he is however wants to seem as a carefree and tough man, when he speaks with Ray at episode 15. I feel his rage unjust, when he talked with his younger self. (Violence makes you strong big cliché? Hope not...) Sara Lance - Brave woman, and he is a desire to kill, but Kendra and Rip(if I well remember) helped her to calm down. She had a terrible past, Arrow seasons show it. Snart helps her to overthrow her killer attitude, they later crush on each other, as I saw. Firestorm - Professor is awesome, he is went through a considerable personality advance, as he became bolder and nicer. In the beginning he is arrogant, bossy and smart-ass, however he learns to listen Jackson, who is helpful, loyal, shrewd and heroic. Summary: I hope season 2 is better. ","9"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-05-13," I never imagined that a real person could portray Captain Cold until I saw Wentworth. Dominic Purcell was one of my favorites since John Doe but I have to say that Miller lends a great degree of authenticity to the role of Snart. He's a survivor and criminally motivated which adds a degree of diversity to the  super-hero  TV show. I hope Destiny is not his final performance because he makes me root for the bad guy and he is so important to the plot! When I first started watching the show my first question was  where is this going exactly  but now I see that there was care involved in making something new an innovative. It also doesn't hurt that Casper Crump is so close to looking and acting like Vandal Savage in the comics. They definitely put a lot of thought in this. I'll keep watching :) ","10"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-05-12," I'm watching this TV series just because i'm patient enough to wait Flash or Arrow or even Supergirl makes its appearance on this TV series.Chay-Ara She has maybe 2 or more opportunity to Kill that Savage, She Hesitate? Come on, I think you just don't have balls to create new enemy or new plot.The Story just sooo bad and predictable.I like Snart and Sara though.Now the team, make up your mind, in some episode they have all the reason to beat Savage and save the world, in some episode they just vulnerable just like that, with only tiny problem. what do you really want? a good team with good teamwork or idiot team that don't really know what they are doing. Captain. That person is a captain? you has 14 episodes to make a good team and 14 episodes to know what your captain wants and what attitude that your captain has. Don't rush on story, catching or killing Savage, give us some glimpse of the team doing their best to synchronize each other, with good story telling. See Flash, See Gotham they are great.There are much to do to make this TV series works, you guys can keep go on just because You are using the DC and The Flash name, other than that.........sorry for my crappy English ","4"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-05-12," Don't understand why the hate .I guess Olicity Soap Opera fans are not getting much out of it. Well its a journey of already build characters from Arrow & Flash .So if you are starting it without watching those or specially didn't watch Arrow then you might not connect with the characters well .Their journey start with single mission in mind & whole season is about how they face problems on the way to complete that mission .Really good quality CGI,good actions & Dialogues which are well written & enjoyable (not like arrow s3,4 where sometime you would like to pull out your hair cz how stupid characters sounds & act) As whole series is about Time travel on a ship with Earth's special 8 ,so don't expect too much of character or chemistry build up cause its not about chemistry with other travelers but more about completing Important mission. There are good amount of character struggle shown which was always enjoyableI think this show has perfect balance for martial art ,guns & super power hero & not struggling like Arrow with too many Archer ,martial artist side kicks .This shows also able to give each character its own unique fight skill which will not mix up with other I think those comic fans who are fed up with comic's, TV adaptation are becoming soap opera ,will find it enjoyable .I guess live action comic should look like this .Characters aren't too weak or struggling too much within to do the right thing ,instead its about how characters enjoy the journey in their missions knowing what is their purpose in the mission .

"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-05-11," Marvel and Comic book heroes, any program will be tempting to watch as was this and despite a disappointing first 3 episodes, the story line never seemed to hold up. Season 1 seemed to progress into an appalling Clichéd Love Drama overload with no improvements in the action or CGI to mitigate.Culminating in a morale dilemma between taking a child's life to save  billions  with analogies of Rip Hunter's Family and a  Child Adolf Hitler . Absolute  WTF  moment when the plot screeched into a massive traffic pile-up despite killing  Innocent Adolf Hitler  is fine considering his destined future path but he catalyst to a supposedly even larger holocaust in exactly similar circumstance is more a  Child  than a future  World Tyrant . Hastily ending with a haphazardly strung ending meant to confuse and  Close Loose Ends  with a distracting following episode to distract just fizzled with a big  PFfffT . I personally feel struggling through 8 episodes was a total waste of time and overly generous faith and misplaced hope in the script writers getting better or at least putting in more effort and creativity.A Discredit to DC Comics and the Characters whom still had some form of believable fantasy and credibility. Dragging  The Arrow  a terrible attempt to stay afloat was also uncalled. I am now much less keen to watch much less follow  The Arrow  Episodes. Better investment of  faith  in Marvel not mucking it up... yet. ","5"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-05-08," So much potential sent straight down the pot.Plot: My 9 yo son could predict it if I allowed him to suffer through it.Sci-Fi Nerd Plot Failures: Oh... this show is candyland for that. If you're looking for flaws, look no further. A fractal of Asimov dies each time someone gives this a good review.Acting: Fair, but it's clear they're limited by the direction.Whiz-Bang: Not a lotta eye candy, least not enough to make it worth watching unless you're a masochist.I had such high hopes, but after suffering through the entire first season I feel like I should go whip myself. Honestly, I gave it a fair chance in hopes that it would blossom into something I'd like to sniff but the end result was akin to the aroma which surrounds a manhole cover.The upside is that it is great to see anything semi Sci-Fi on one of the conglomerate networks, regardless of how vapid it is. Who knows, maybe someone who enjoys watching it might get turned onto the good stuff and provide viewers with some content that isn't so... hollow and consumer driven.The downside is that if this series gets continued, when other excellent series haven't, my faith in general human intellect will drop yet another notch.Time is something I have aplenty at the moment, and the only reason I gave this a 2/10 rating is because I broke my leg, had nothing else to watch, and it was better than watching the Smurfs. If stupid was edible, no one would be hungry  -Samuel Johnson ","2"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-05-07," The sort of sad thing about this show is its relationship to Arrow and Flash. It really does have all the basic potential of those shows, but they seem to have forgotten to hire writers. The plots are all over the place, the characters are inconsistently stupid, despite all of them having backgrounds that belie that. If they could just knuckle down on the writing, create a consistent theme and some good episodes, it would work, but instead they have their characters doing inconsistently stupid acts, and they never seem to learn or develop.Honestly, not the only series or film where this is a problem. Somehow the makers of entertainment have become worse and worse about throwing more and more money into making things look good, but no money into writing. Into creating characters and situations that we can believe in and care about. This show is just one good example especially because we can compare it with shows like Arrow and Flash, where part of the reason we watch is that there is enough reality to the fantasy for us to accept them. There is a lot of potential here, divergent characters who have each suffered in their own ways are brought together. People who are likely to contribute solutions to their problems based on unique experiences. And an incredible range of possibilities for plots, literally all of time. Anyone remember Firefly? Good writing is the foundation of making something like this work. This show does not have that at present. ","4"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-05-01," Apart from having near poor actors (except Captain Cold), the show lacks good writing and scripts. I understand that a you cannot expect complete sense from a science fiction and that too from a time traveling one. However what I don't understand is how come, if merely by not attaining a party can vanish the ring off professor Stein's finger, then doing all the fancy fighting in cowboy era doesn't set anything or affect anything in the future. The writers, in pure negligence/laziness or probably due to lack of understanding, are using all time travel and science mambo-jumbo to suite their needs which are contradictory and making no sense even from the standards of fiction. Certain mistakes like  prince Khufu  being called  carter  and  Chay- Ara  being called  Kendra  across different incarnations is the proof lazy writing.I never had any expectations from this one but this might have spoiled the entire Flash/Arrow world for me. I hope however that they don'g bring back the dead Canary in the Arrow now. ","3"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-04-29," I don't even know where to start with this one. I want to like it, I really want to like it. Greg Berlanti usually does pretty interesting stuff, but this particular series just seems to be so lackluster and largely pointless.I also want to like it because of Brandon Routh and Victor Garber who, again, have both been good in other things. I think the writing is to blame. Hackneyed, cliché, and clunky, never mind that some of the plot is just ridiculous... Yuck....Watching it as I write this, but I have to change the channel to something different, it's just too stupid to continue watching... ","2"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-04-29," UPDATE: I've continued watching this for the second season and it's gone downhill as far as the writing goes. The plots are getting thinner and the characters have become cardboard cutouts. Dominic Purcell is still pulling off some amazing scenes considering how poorly his character is being written but other good actors like Victor Garber are flailing with the dismal dialogue. I'm downgrading it from a 7 to a 6.First Season; This is wonderfully over-dramatic and insanely convoluted with gaps in logic and reason. It's a comic book come-to-life. If you've tuned in for award-winning acting and realism, you're not finding it here and you're kind of crazy for thinking you would.For me, it's fun, energetic and full of inside geek jokes. It's also a bit heavy-handed with the 'redemption/friendship' themes but this is pretty standard in superhero stuff.If you follow Arrow or Flash, this is going to feel very familiar. Many of the characters were introduced on those shows and the productions are all filmed in Vancouver so they have a similar vibe to them.My only real complaint about the show is that the 'captain' isn't particularly likable. It feels like they've tried to cross Dr. Who with Indiana Jones but he can't quite pull it off.Marvel Comics has set the bar very high with Joss Weadon at the helm and this doesn't compete on the same level but it's still entertaining. ","6"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-04-26," I'm still not sure how I feel about  Legends of Tomorrow . I liked Ray more in  Arrow  and the thought of these eight random rogues working together is baffling. But the more I watched the more I learned to accept the show for what it is: comic book eye candy. That's really all it is. There's occasional moments of good acting; they're rare but they happen, mainly from Garber and Miller who fit like a glove into their characters Dr. Martin Stein and Leonard Snart (Captain Cold) respectively. None of the acting is offensively bad actually. It's the writing that's the bane of the show. These characters are constantly saying and doing the stupidest possible things in any given situation. It's one thing to suspend disbelief but it helps to have a modicum of common sense to keep us grounded, which many of these characters do not.The writers clearly don't care. The concept of time is asinine. They go back and forth through time with no coherent explanation, reasoning, or consequence. Vandal Savage is wasted as a villain. Casper Crump plays him as an over-the-top Christoph Waltz type baddie, and he's fun to watch but the character itself is hollow and awfully written into the show. Every confrontation between the Legends and Savage end up with Savage escaping in an inexplicably dumb fashion, and then the group continues their search to attack him in a different time. Characters say things that make you upset at the TV, like,  Did you really have to do that? Now I have to dislike you. The plot itself is ass. Rip Hunter gathers a team to find and kill Vandal Savage by attacking him at different points in time. But it's like, who cares? You can accept it because it's so confident in its insanity and so insistent on constantly shoving money at the screen to distract us, and for the most part, it works. The first few episodes are tough to stomach because the writing is SO gratingly awful from the get-go, but once the characters develop more and gain some semblance of chemistry (between some of them at least, namely Snart and Sara) and when they experiment with different time periods, that's where the show starts to get fun. The Wild West episode is entertaining, as are the ones where they explore the '50s and the racism and sexism that come with it. And the characters do grow on you. Snart was carrying the first few episodes but now it's more balanced. It's difficult juggling so many main characters and the show suffers for it, but the fun comes from watching these misfits interact in their absurd surroundings, making for some fun character building moments and the occasional comic relief. I actually don't hate Sara anymore, and Mick does his best Batman impression which makes for some hilarious moments, intentional or otherwise.As it stands,  Legends of Tomorrow  has a lot of potential. Clearly the special effects budget is satisfied - the action sequences are fun to watch - but the writing needs to come together if this is going to continue as a series longterm. If nothing else, it's better than  Arrow  this season (though that's not saying much). If you're a fan of the other DC shows or a sci-fi nut in general, you might get some popcorn-level entertainment from  Legends of Tomorrow . ","6"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-04-23," Here we go again! Why is it that most TV writers, when doing a show based 100% on the idea of time travel, totally ignore the implications of the paradox they create? In this show we have a man hell bent on going back in time to kill the person responsible for killing his wife and son; of course, he also wants to  save the world , but that's just icing on the cake for him. That is the total reason why he defies the Time Masters, steals a time ship and assembles a crew for the mission.Now lets say he is ultimately successful and kills this guy. Now his wife and son no longer get murdered. Wait! If his wife and son are not murdered, he no longer has a reason to defy the Time Masters, steal a time ship and assemble a crew for the mission! So it never happens! This is the most basic paradox there is for any story based on time travel. It's the same as the Grandfather Paradox. It you were to go back in time and kill your grandfather when he was a young man, before your father is born, you would never be born and thus could not go back in time to murder your grandfather! Good time travel stories get around this paradox by proposing the idea of creating alternate timelines. But such a theory has not been done here.Too bad! ","4"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-04-22," The concept of this series was very promising. Use a time machine to stop an immortal threat from eventually taking over and ending the world. I just wish they had watched a time machine show or movie before trying to write this show. The  leader  of the mission Rip Hunter is by far the worst, incompetent, time traveler ever put on TV. **Spoiler**In the second episode he says it is impossible to change the past in which they participated in or it will cause a temporal paradox. Which is normal time travel knowledge. In  Time Cop  interacting with yourself would remove yourself from the timeline as an example. In the very last episode of this show I will ever watch has him allowing themselves to save themselves in the past (White Canary). Then Rip tells his team they cant interact with themselves (after it has already been done), but ends with him patting his younger self on the shoulder telling him he will be OK right before his younger self stabs the villain and is immediately put into the line of fire of all their attacks. Who thought that was a good plan? This is after the  heroes  who had previously just abducted newborn baby versions of themselves from their parents (they literally take one of them from their fathers arms right after they were born leaving the heroes mother bleeding in the backseat of their car). Which sounds horribly non heroic to me. Why not capture the villain who is trying to kill all of the cast when they were young, when they saved themselves earlier? Atom hits the villain with a blast and then just leaves. WHY NOT CAPTURE HER THEN? Then later they complain that they cant find where she is and they are all in danger. It makes me wanna slap the writers. At first I thought it was cause they were  heroes  and didn't want to kill the villain. But at least try to capture her to protect yourselves. Its like Rip told them all before the mission, to only save themselves and let the problem with the time travelling villain to escalate for no reason. But no they put them in a safe house which changes the future so that their loved ones no longer recognize them, but then kill the villain anyways. Breaking the laws of time, and maybe directly changing themselves and their pasts to the point where they most likely wont have gotten aboard the time ship in the first place after leading completely different lives...There are numerous times when the heroes could have ended the show by removing the immortal villain Vandal Savage, but choose to run away instead. I mean he is literally knocked out and Kendra the only one who can end him forever is nearby with the knife needed to save everyone just leaves for no reason. (She was hurt at the time but just carry her over to him and end him...) ** Spoiler end**While the special effects are good, the writing of the show is so mind blowingly horrible it is not worth admission. Its like watching a horrible horror movie where the victims randomly drop useful weapons and walk around alone for no reason, after so many stupid decisions, it makes you want them to die for their stupidity. The only reason this show has not gotten a 1 rating for me is the decent special effects. In my opinion, this show should be put out of its mercy and the writers should never work in Hollywood again. ","2"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-04-20," In my opinion, Legends of Tomorrow is a series that built up hype but was a let-down. There is little to no character development in this series. It has an unfocused storyline and boring characters. The only likable characters were Captain Cold, Rip Hunter and The Atom. One of the few good things of this series is showing the hopeful future for the Arrowverse. There are a few episodes that are enjoyable such as the Jonah Hex episode and the Star City 2046 episode. A majority of the acting is bland and one- dimensional. There is more campy jokes and set-up for potential spin-offs than storyline. I really hope that the second season is much more of an improvement because so far, Legends of Tomorrow is a mess of a series with a sloppy storyline and one-dimensional characters. I don't recommend it unless you like unfocused narrative and cheesy one- liners. 4/10. ","4"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-04-17," It was a nice start for this series with a bunch of heroes and a time traveler going up against Vandal Savage. But then very fast it became less about Vandal and more about time travel. Now it has become a very bad depiction of  doctor who . they just go somewhere in time, messes up the time line and then try to fix it but most of the time they mess it up beyond repair. Besides time travel is such a delicate subject and they don't seem to care enough, according to the lead role, Rip hunter, as long as he is doing something to prevent Savage's uprising he is doing right no matter the consequences. Then there is that forced love story of Atom and HawkGirl, just pathetic. Don't understand how Captain cold and Mick fit into this, they always have their own agenda. For a person so concerned about Savage how can he risk the time line with those 2 doing their own thing. Finally you see Vandal in 1 out of 5 episodes, rest are just ridiculous and unnecessary time travels. I had enough of this, good luck to those who are still waiting for something good to happen. ","4"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-04-15," It started out as a good idea. Vandal Savage is a brilliant villain in the DC comics and would be excellent as the antagonist. However the acting is terrible and the script has been written by teenagers.1. Hawkgirl is supposed to be a battle hungry warrior but this hawkgirl has serious identity issues and a terrible costume.2. Once again Brandon Routh has ruined another DC hero. He is a terrible atom, although better than him in Superman returns.3.Sara Lance aka white canary is probably the most entertaining one of them all. But she is an ASSASSIN yet she doesn't kill. Seriously DC?4. Captain Cold is supposed to be Mr. Freeze's sidekick. Plus the way he talks annoys me.5. The 2 people who make up Firestorm are always fighting over the same thing and it's really getting on my nerves.6. Rip Hunter is a terrible leader, tactician and pilot. Not to mention his gun from the future looks horrible. I'd have respected him more if they used a much more suave actor who uses an actual .44 magnum ","4"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-04-15," Be wary of this show...it is NOT the same quality as the Flash, or even Arrow. I have a few main gripes with this show, not the least of which is the story. Time travel is never an easy concept to grasp for fantasy, but this show ABSOLUTELY BUTCHES IT'S OWN RULES. They say that they can't go back and mess with time, BUT LITERALLY EVERY SHOW IS MESSING WITH TIME. It almost never has any ramifications that stick. Butterfly effect? Not a thing, in the least. Beyond that, things just happen without much explanation and it feels at the very least unnatural. Mick and Leonard fight and then are somehow okay with each other for no reason. Kendra loves Ray because...reasons. It's all slopped together, and not in the least cohesive. The dialogue is also very corny..it seems as though they try to put in humor, but the writers suck and not once has it made me laugh. As far as the action goes, it's OKAY but nothing too special. It doesn't really ever feel intense, and in no way does it ever keep me on the edge of my seat. Also, there's a lot of times where the characters decide not to use their powers, which is just great. Ever wanted to see Martin Stein use a gun instead of being Firestorm a lot of the time? This show is for you. I have a lot more complaints, but it can be summed up as, at the very least, disappointing. Especially when you have an awesome main series, in  The Flash . That show does everything right. You care about the characters, the action is awesome, the storyline is engaging, good stuff. Not this. ","4"

"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-04-13," This Review Contains spoilers. YOU HAVE BEEN WARNEDThere is so much wrong with this show so i'll go over everything as best as possible. honestly this is my first review. i had to make an account because that's how bad the show is I JUST HAD TO LET PEOPLE KNOW.First off we have this character  Rip Hunter  who couldn't be any more similar to the doctor, honestly they even cast Arthur Darvill, someone who acted as the doctors companion to play him. he steals a time machine and goes around time with companions HMMM Doesn't RING ANY BELLS, SOUNDS PRETTY ORIGINAL TO ME....... he goes around time messing up so badly that he and his  team  have to fix it.. who even had the idea for this WHO EVEN WROTE IT! OK so ill break down the episodes I've seen.-Lets hunt Vandal Savage and save my family! -OH NO HE KILLED CARTER MAKING HIM MORE POWERFUL -Maybe we can outsmart him next episode -OH NO WE GAVE HIM THE SECRET TO FIRESTORM WHAT A DISASTER! -Ok this time for real now -OH NO WE MADE THE FUTURE EVEN WORSE BY MAKING EVENTS HAPPEN SOONER THAN INTENDEDthese guys should never be allowed to travel in time, no wonder the time masters are sick of their Crap and want them dead. i would too.the show is so poorly written... no story really.. seems like those typical dc shows beat a bad guy a even bigger bad guys replaces him and so on so on.i'm a proud fan of dc comics but this is just degrading honestly marvel does it so much better with the story the action the connection of the shows sure every show has room for improvement and marvel has its flaws with its shows but this show shouldn't exist... the mindset for dc shows are  MORE HEROES MORE! MORE! MORE!. Jesus MAKE IT STOP. they keep adding more heroes into the show as if it makes it better and more exciting to see more. BUT IT JUST RUINS THE IMAGE OF EVERY HERO IN THE DAMN SHOW.Sorry about my bad writing this is my first review and probably my last.. so enjoy ","1"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-04-11," There is actually no logic in this series, despite that it consists of bad acting, high paced but in the end meaningless action sequences, characters, who are not really interesting (despite snart and sometimes firestorm) and a lot of vfx. VFX doesn't make a bad script good. Sometimes the show manages to be slightly entertaining, but in the end, it's not even good entertainmentThe character of kendra also just doesn't work, she is boring and you don't really care what happens to her though she seems to be the core to the story. The flash is way better!The worst part is still the script!I hope it will get better in future episodes, but I'll probably won't be watching... ","2"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-04-08," I can let the numerous loopholes go seeing as there are so DAMN MANY OF THEM...I can even forgive the idiotic narrative.Even the fact that the whole series should've been over in episode 1, instead we get the old  bad guy tells his plans and foils himself  spiel.The acting is shocking.It is incredibly repetitive and is just Arrow rehashed without any comedic value or interest. You'd think with time travel they'd have better ideas than these.The time travel makes it incredibly convoluted. This show is truly horrible compared to others like the Flash, Arrow, hell even Supergirl is better. ","3"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-04-03," All fair and square it gets a 2 for me for having real actors and okayish FX. The rest is just.... borderline insulting. 1)Most of the plot involve the  legends  not listening to one another and fighting among themselves. 2)The science is--- argh. You would expect some thought actually given to time travel as it is quite the tricky subject, but no. It's just a patchwork of ideas with no logic behind them. Examples (spoilers),in one episode they travel to a future which is all messed up and decide to fix things there before going back to the past - which renders pretty much this episode useless. Ship is affected by gravity while traveling through time? meh.There is supposed to be this time master guild thing, they show up with updated time master tech. Wouldn't just traveling in the future in the first place would have enabled the guild to have whatever tech they might have needed from the get go?Time pirates ?3)The antagonist is an immortal; nothing is clearly done to stop him. IT is more a search for him, fighting, messing up time line, going back into ship, inner discord, repeat.To sum up. Quite a fail. I play the episode as bckrg noises to keep my cats busy when there is nothing else. ","2"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-04-03," The pilot episode sets forth the promising tale of a motley crew destined for greatness on a romp through time and space. And, for the most part, it succeeds at continuing a trend of mostly-good DC Superhero TV on the CW. Helped along by several characters that have earned us caring about them from their development on Arrow and The Flash, Victor Garber's Martin Stein, Caity Lotz's Sarah Lance, and Brandon Routh's Ray Palmer ground the show with enough heart to kick-start it into action.Meanwhile, Snart and Rory continue to play the well characterized pair of funny anti-heroes that we have seen again and again on the other CW shows. In particular, Captain Cold's absurdly dry sense of humor and knack for puns cuts through moments of necessary pilot exposition.The real standout, though, is Arthur Darvill as Rip Hunter, whose sharp comedic timing and deeper acting chops should help keep the show grounded in a strong protagonist moving forward. The more Legends of Tomorrow leans on Darvill and Garber for dramatic story lines, the better.Unfortunately, not all of the characters on the team are well-developed or well-acted. Hawkman and Hawkgirl continue to be as trite and uninteresting as they were during their stint on The Flash. And despite the potential in Vandal Savage as a character, his writing thus far has not been nuanced or compelling enough to set him on par with CW's other seasonal  Big Bads .Moving forward, the show should succeed if it focuses on its characters and actors that elevate it above mere comic book cheese, and if it executes its promise of time-travel shenanigans in inventive, fun ways.Legends of Tomorrow doesn't look poised to knock The Flash from its  best in DC  throne just yet. The Flash benefits from not having boring main characters (I'm looking at you Hawkman/Hawkgirl, and Arrow's terrible Laurel Lance). Consistency will be Legends of Tomorrow's biggest challenge if it wants to one-up The Flash and legitimize future expansion of CW's DC Universe. 6/10 ","6"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-04-03," Almost every movie with time travel in it have problems with the consistency and logic. If you want a whole series with the worst kind of logical mishaps around time travel - this is the show for you!Finally they beat the bad guy after a few episodes, but he is immortal, so they just leave him (although they have won and don't need to rush) to resurrect, and immediately looks for the next place in time where they can find him. Why!?? Just take the body and put him in jail if you cannot kill him definitely! They have all the possibilities right there! All the other actions the characters take are so flawed and retarded I cannot stand it. The possibilities they have with time travel are endless, and yet all the time they take some really random course of action with no sense to it.The acting, visual effects, characters etc is really good. But the story is so flawed I have to let go. ","4"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-03-30," its BRADON ROUTH made me watch the show its only him and only him only because i cant off my eyes of him . HE IS SIMPLY PERFECT . His appeal is like a magnet on TV. As fun as the other DC comics have been to this point, the action sequences have operated on a small scale, Seemingly taking on a philosophy of fight or die the action is not only pure spectacle, but perfectly fast paced , who makes frequent cuts so that we can see everything that's going on with the different heroes. The battle sequence between the superhero team bad guys army is better than all of the action in the other TV action super heroes combined and multiplied by ten. It earns the buildup from all the preceding films by being the most epic title we've seen with these characters yet. ","9"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-03-28," This show focuses on the stupidity and pettiness of each superhero rather than the action aspect the audience expects from a super hero series. Personalities have been over-exaggerated and in some cases completely contradicts the part they played in Arrow and Flash. Events from the show are unrealistic well beyond its sci-fi component.Thus far the show has no characters to catch your eye. There is a reason to dislike every character in the show and there has been no character/team development. The plot is messy where every character has their own agenda. Advice to the directors is to return to what a super hero show should focus on - the discovery of powers and learning to control such powers. There's no reason Hawk Girl should still be merely a human with wings and no other abilities. Tie the team together already with a strong leader. The learning curve to work as a team should've passed long ago yet there's been no progress on collaboration. It's almost like watching a pathetic drama at this point.In Arrow and the Flash, it takes at least half a season to get to reach the criminal mastermind. In this show, it takes half an episode every time.The 3 points I gave go towards the visual effects and the fact that Arrow and The Flash are tied in well to this show. ","3"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-03-27," Like most i am sure i waited with anticipation for this. Already being a big fan of arrow and flash my expectations were high. Disappointed would be too strong a statement but it really needs pulling together. It will always be difficult to make things gel when you have several superheroes all vying for the same position but Flash and Agents of shield make it work. There are lots of things which make me cringe  TIME MASTER  come on guys even though Arthur Darvill previously DOCTOR WHO doesn't warrant the tag  TIME LORD  (Not sure he is a strong enough character) The only characters holding it together are Caity Lotz BLACK CANARY and Wentworth Miller CAPTAIN COLD. Writers need to rethink the whole plots and subplots if season two is going to be a success. Just take a look around at FLASH and Agents of Shield don't try to reinvent the wheel when it already turns. ","5"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-03-25," Captain cold,Heat wave, Firestorm , Atom ,White canary , Rip hunter , Hawk-man,Hawk-girl's most important adventure from stopping Vandal Savage from being the dictator of the world by changing the time line (actually one of the best ideas ever).Went worth Miller has performed quite well.There are many suspense s and Twists as they time travel. Time travel is an imaginary idea . But legends of tomorrow has made us believe that time traveling real . My preference is Captain cold since he is COOL. The team selection is good -Dr.Martin Stein(BRAIN),Captain Cold(STEALTH),heat wave (MUSCLE),Atom (SHRINK),White canary (FIGHTING SKILLS),Hawk girl and Hawk man (TEAM SPIRIT).The start is good the TV series is fast and not slow. One of the BEST TV SERIES EVER ","10"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-03-21," As a lover of the flash and arrow I was really looking forward to this. A Justice League type TV show is just what DC needs after the success of Flash and Arrow, but I'm still not impressed.All of the characters have different personalities and a variety of powers, but so far I just don't see them working together. There doesn't appear to be any coordination or team work. In fight scenes its just everyone doing their own thing near each other. Outside of fighting they all get tasked to do something and most of the time end up ignoring orders to do what they want.The acting and effects are good. I even like most of the heroes, but the writers really messed up this show. I understand a certain amount of character building is needed for a show like this, but 8 episodes in and there's still no teamwork, no storyline advances and so far only 1 good episode(7). ","6"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-03-11," The idea of scooping up a number of fringe heroes and villains into one in-fighting unit might work in comic-land but certainly doesn't seem to on the TV screen. Here we get a motley selection of characters from DC's two hit series  The Flash  and  Arrow , pressed into action to chase down time-travelling super-villain Vandal Savage under the aegis of their self-appointed, very British team-leader Rip Hunter.I'm not aware of this show being based on any original magazine in the DC universe, making this a new-for-TV premise and I have to say it looks and plays awkwardly. Arthur Darvill steals some clothes from another time traveller with whom he's previously shared a police box and adds the most pukka English accent he can find. As for his assorted companions, they seem too many and too disparate. I get that they're mostly in pairs, Hawkman and Hawkgirl, ex-cons Captain Cold and Heat Wave and of course the two-for-the-price-of-one Firestorm making me think that Ray Atom Palmer and Sara Canary might yet get together. For me, they all of them just don't really gel, lines apparently distributed to each just to give them something to say rather than delineating character.I must say, I'm also finding the endless deaths of the hawk-pair are starting to bore too and still haven't quite worked out what makes Vandal Savage so omnipotent and a match for all of them. The SFX aren't doing it for me either especially those involving Hawkman, Hawkgirl and The Atom. The idea of chasing Savage through time is of course unoriginal but could work if used imaginatively and humorously enough but this might take time (no pun intended) to fully develop.Whether the programme finds an audience and gets retained for another series will be interesting to see. Personally, I'm not optimistic and really much prefer the characters where they were before. Maybe it'll get deeper and darker as it goes but just now I'm not really sure it's going anywhere but into TV oblivion. ","3"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-03-11," Having just watched ep 8 it's hard to see where this show is going. Vandal Savage is not a strong villain and the plot is wandering all over the place and the romantic sub plots!Chronos is almost a joke and to my mind the team have not really bonded or become interesting. The characters on Flash and Arrow are likable and the plots seem to have a point and a destination. Special effects are very average, read cheap. Dressing up in 1950's dresses is not the same as making us feel like they are real time travellers. They won't make season 2 unless the episodes really improve. ","5"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-03-10," I've been looking forward to this show since that last ep of Flash. The trailer looked good and I was excited. Unfortunately all the talent must have gone into creating the trailers and marketing the show, because the actual product... well it really blows..What a disappointment.I gave it a try too, watched all the episodes hoping the writers will find their footing eventually, but I guess not. Here are what sucks about the show:- Rip Hunter -- I think the actor is all wrong for the part, he has no chemistry with anyone and he's supposed to lead the team!!! So far he seems to be in the way and an annoyance more than anything. His clichéd storyline of avenging the deaths of his wife and son (ugh) already bored me to tears. With so many good and unpredictable shows around (e.g Shades of Blue), you CANNOT be this boring and clichéd.- The two (now one) winged people -- again these were the most dreary actors acting the dreariest of parts. They were so depressing, neither one looked like they wanted to be there. They were made tolerable in The Flash despite their individual awfulness, I think the writers on Flash really deserves praise for that.- Captain Cold and Heatwave -- the two best actors on the show made up some of the least horrible scenes that were at least mildly entertaining, but barely scratched their acting skills. Why waren't they used more?? - Canary -- not used nearly enough, again a talent that is wasted by poor writing- Firestorm duo -- again, they were great in the Flash. But somehow on this show, they just don't pop. Even scenes that are supposed to be touching or meaningful end up flat or are spoiled by the pace of the show.- The Atom -- he was good in Arrow and the Flash buit in legends of Tomorrow, this poor guy comes across as a very flat 2-dimensional character. He's used mostly for (weak) jokes and laughs.In short, after watching and giving up on Legends of Tomorrow, I have a newfound appreciation for the shows that are actually GOOD and the writers that produce those awesome shows. ","1"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-03-09," I want to really like this show but every episode seems to be the same. With all the advantages of coming from the future they cannot seem to stop one guy from ancient Egyptian times. Each mission seems to be the same, the Snark brothers seem to want to go off script and rob a bank, the priestess is not confident in her skills, Sara has blood-lust etc...You really cannot capture or kill a guy when you have technology 50-100 years(or 1000's of years if you go back to his birth) newer this guy would never see coming? I mean I understand he's somewhat immortal but snatch the guy, pull a Han Solo and freeze/bury him and dump him in the deepest part of the ocean.I'm hoping it gets better because I do enjoy the Flash and Arrow for some mindless entertainment. Giving it a couple more episodes. ","6"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-03-08," I'm definitely a Marvel guy and the DC Comics TV Shows are no help to the argument. So if you're a fan of Arrow, Supergirl or The Flash, this review does not apply to you. The acting is mediocre (I mean, even when they're just shooting their guns with no lines whatsoever, they're unconvincing),the props look like cheap toys, the sets are way too fake, they can't even nail simple explosion scenes! The dialogs are beyond predictable and emotional in all the wrong places. I get that the  Prison Break bros  are supposed to portray two psycho villains but do they have to make the crazy eyes and creepy faces? Constantly reminding us how evil and devious criminals they are... We get it, we get it! You're two crazy dudes. Get over it. I find it impossible to relate to any of these characters because they have no personality, they just look like people who watched one too many Steven Seagal movie by the way they walk and talk. Or, it's possible that my expectations were way too high due to the (misleading?) 7.5 stars on IMDb. I don't get it. Can't help but imagine a roomful of guys in a DC-owned building just giving fake ratings. I would recommend Jessica Jones and Daredevil. Or just watching your nails grow. ","3"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-03-06," This show could be soooo much cooler. I think the developers were trying to go for an  American  Dr. Who. They even hired Arthur Darvil to play  Rip Hunter  (manly name for a wimpy guy) to play the Capt. of the time ship. The time ship is bigger on the inside than the outside though it does not look like a police box. The Doct... I mean the Captain's companions are a group of reject heroes and anti heroes that decide to go with the Capt. to save the world from Vandal Savage, an immortal. Where does the show fail. Acting is okay with a few of the actors but gets overshadowed by some of the poorer actors that they play next too. With time as each gets used to playing their character that may improve. The plots. Oh those terrible, contrived, poorly thought out plots. The way the characters are forced to  solve  the problems that face them is almost cringe worthy. I find myself saying,  wait, this is stupid why don't they just....  Forced plots are no fun to sit through and are the results of lazy writers not being able to match the abilities of the characters with the problems that they face. Thus plot holes and characters ignoring the obvious abound in the series. With Scooby Doo I can understand why they are always splitting up to go find the ghost, but when this happens all the time in this series causing all sorts of problems that could have easily been avoided, it grates. Finally the writing and character relationships. Why the crew has not thrown the Captain out an airlock is beyond me. Some of the relationships seem almost as forced as the plots. The dialog needs more cleverness and wit. Perhaps if they could track down some of the writers for Doctor Who we could see a positive change. ","5"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-03-03," OK, why the heck doesn't Firestorm actually get used? The NUCLEAR MAN is always in his two component entities, each swinging ineffectual punches at things. SERIOUSLY!? The episode 'Marooned' had both Stein and Jefferson surrounded by bad guys, AND THEY DIDN'T EVEN CONSIDER BONDING INTO FIRESTORM.He's the most powerful member of the team, and yet...they'd rather have White Canary kick things and get tossed across the room.This show should be canceled. It's really hard to find a reason to like it. It's a crying shame, because Arrow and The Flash are actually pretty good shows, but this one reeks of another DC dropped ball :(. ","4"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-03-03," I read in the IMDb page for this TV series and it provide a discussion about Rip Hunter and Dr. Who and how much they kind of resembled each other, which I did catch in the first two episodes that I watched. So, who stole who's idea or which came first Dr. Who or Rip Hunter? Just curious. But regardless the show was very good so far and I look forward to watching more episodes. I hope there is someway that the two characters that are hawks are reunited again. In their realm I guess anything is possible. Lets hope that this isn't a flash in the pan and after this season, the studios cancel it like other shows of late. Marvel, keep up the great work like Marvels Agent Carter and others that you have put out for our enjoyment. ","9"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-03-02," A bunch of super heroes, time jumps, how can you go wrong? Well, apparently, quite a lot. The script is not inspiring and quite repetitive, the acting is not exactly Oscar material, the subplots and budget bickering (having actors bicker about nonsense is very cheap, that's what Walking Dead taught us) are starting to get aggravating.I've watched six episodes now and I don't think this show is worth my time. I don't think I like a single one of the main characters, they all feel very shallow and cheesy.The only reason I continued watching was it was a sci-fi show, but love for a genre cannot save a mediocre show. ","4"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-03-01," I started watching this based on the high score it had initially on IMDb (about 8.6 two weeks ago) and I was seriously disappointed. The only explanation I have for the unusual high score for a new show is that the producers pay lots and lots of people to write positive reviews in order to get a high score that would attract lots of people (like me). What is the point though, if after watching the first episode the normal viewer (like me) will be disappointed enough to stop watching the show and even come to IMDb to make things right and write the truth about it. There isn't really much to say but that they decided to pick the most clueless of  super heroes  from other shows and start one. I don't know which one is worse. The white (or black or grey) canary is a terrible actress and her skills in martial arts are to say the least ridiculous for someone so chubby and out of form, the dress she is wearing now (grey) is so tight around her rack that a very unlovable piece of fat pops from under her arms... NOT NICE TO WATCH. The two former prison break actors are as bad, perhaps they'd do better trying to break from some jail again. The others I can barely remember. The plot is about some time/space traveling trying to catch  the worst criminal ever  and failing miserably in each attempt. The fighting scenes are just plain silly with prison break brothers firing some kind of flame thrower that hurts no one and grey canary hitting people with two sticks. I have stopped watching this after the second episode. ","3"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-02-29," I am neither qualified enough nor can i say enough about how exhilarating and mesmerizing this series is.What i can say is that i am both a fan and an enthusiast of modern cinematic showcases and like most have grown up with an appreciation for television series often secretly proclaiming to be somewhat of a connoisseur. I gave this show a try and continually wished for it to be what i hoped and chose not to watch it for fear of it not meeting my expectations. I was pleasantly surprised.In our culture not enough praise is given to our entertainment and for some reason a collective have taken it upon themselves to find faults and ridicule rather than every purposefully beautiful, engineered detail in what we are presented - this i feel is not the right approach and i always try to find the best in everything.Legends of tomorrow delivers. For me it is an unbelievable culmination of brilliantly executed meta-neo-fantasy. The actors, the graphics, the staging, the design - all beaming in an array of synchronosis i have never seen before. There is wit, there is drama and unwavering action which i cannot explain where the makers have found the time to choreograph. In short a bravo of extended gratitude - i am glad to be in this time, (to fit along with the premise) privileged to witness this perfect piece of spectacular spectacle. ","10"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-02-27," Personally I really enjoy this series. Is it a hardcore DC/marvel series? No. And it's not supposed to be. Is it an in depth story with big names and script? Nope. But that's not a bad thing really. It's just a fun series that has interesting characters with different pasts who want to become legends for different reasons and in the process grow as a character. If your looking for a 100% DC then your looking at the wrong series, but if you just wanna watch a series that is inspired by characters of DC on a fun spin off that doesn't take itself to seriously then it's worth the watch. I actually prefer this series to the flash by far, and the Arrow as well (first few seasons of the Arrow was good, then it just got weird). It's a great series that I truly enjoy watching and eagerly wait for the next episode! ","10"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-02-19," This show is idiotic. I don't know who writes it.. a bunch of 12 year old kids with below average IQ? Acting sucks.. it's as if there is no director at all.. No redeeming qualities. I wish there was only the Flash and Arrow at this point. Supergirl and this crap ruins the universe.Had to stop watching after episode 3. HAD TO. I hated all 3 episodes, pretty much every single aspect of them. Made me hate characters I previously liked or loved. I absolutely loved Sarah in the Arrow, and I liked the professor when he first showed up. BAH, don't even know what to say. The show makes no sense at all, logic is not something the writers have. I'm hoping that there will be no crossovers between this and the Flash and Arrow. ","1"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-02-18," Here's the thing about Legends of Tomorrow: if you've been watching Arrow and The Flash and Supergirl right along, then you already know the level of writing and style of acting that you're going to meet in Legends of Tomorrow. Let's be honest, it's not the best writing in the world and the acting is (I think rather purposely) over-the-top. In that sense it's actually rather true to the comics, where there is a great deal of declaring  I will defeat you!  before clashing weapons. If you are looking for superhero-realism, go watch something Marvel. The DC televised universe has steered clear of realism ever since Barry Allen walked onto the set of Arrow. If you can't stand to watch the other DC shows, then don't bother watching this one as it is set in the exact same tone and style.If, however, you can enjoy the comic-book style fun of The Flash and Supergirl, and you've been sitting around wondering where the heck Snart and Ray Palmer and Prof. Stein have gone off to, then Legends of Tomorrow is for you! It's a bumpy start, and after the pilot episode I'm still wondering why exactly Captain Cold and Heatwave are bothering to hang around, but then Supergirl had a rough start too and she's managed to pull things together enjoyably.The biggest adjustment: Arthur Darvill (aka Rory Williams) is now playing a rather Doctor-like character, Rip Hunter. A man from the future, he stole a time machine against the orders of the Time Masters, and is now traveling around with a band of misfits trying to save the world. Insert skeptical face here. A quick visit to Wikipedia reveals that Rip Hunter is a character that's been around since the '70's in various incarnations, and that the writers handpicked the choicest details, scrambled them together, and have now invented for our pleasure a new version of the character (nothing new there). If the character is examined it's not really the Doctor at all. A little less staggering intelligence, a little more bad-assery, and a deep seeded need for vengeance that drives everything he does, and the character of Rip looks less and less like the Doctor. It'll be interesting to see how he develops, along with all these other characters.The most correct comparison for LoT would be to the Justice League, but as everyone is determined to compare it to Marvel then the best comparison is Agents of Shield meets Guardians of the Galaxy; A ragged team of misfits that don't really know what they're doing yet in a very mission-based, weekly plot. It's not the best thing to hit television, but it's far from the worst. And like all CW shows, it's not the plot that brings me back each week but the characters. Concern and curiosity for them will allow me to give this show a chance. And if you take my advice, you'll give it a chance too. ","7"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-02-17," This show is a stain upon an otherwise unremarkable universe. It is a weak attempt to preempt Marvel's 'The Defenders' in creating a team-based superhero TV series, but fails miserably from the very start. What stands out is the mediocrity of the cast, the horrendous acting, the nonsensical and inconsistent premise (at the pilot, that must be a record!), and the motivation for the entire show literally being  forbidden love gone 'I told you so'  with time shenanigans.Rip Hunter is a time-traveler who had a very brief mention as the inventor of the 'time bubble' in 'The Flash'. He wields a laser revolver. It is seriously designed to look like a revolver, with a cylinder having blue light where the bullet chambers would normally be. He is the sole reason the team exist, and his motivation is boring, unoriginal, and lacking. For a character with the ability to travel through time, he always seems to be in a hurry. His ship is called the 'Waverider', which is a reference to another DC character (who is not, in fact, a time traveling spaceship). The series starts with him pleading to his employers to let him save the world, with a more than obvious conclusion the series expects to be a major reveal at the end of the pilot. It's not.The team-selection process reveals strong self-awareness, as the primary reason for why Rip selects this team is quite literally  no one cares about you guys and you will have no significant impact on the DC extended universe . I wish I was making this up, but this is what goes for creative writing nowadays. Now, we not only have a show with mediocre characters played by mediocre actors in a mediocre story, we're also told from the very get go that these characters are insignificant and a bunch of losers.The first recruit is Atom, a guy with a special suit allowing him to shrink (and fly and shoot lasers because screw comics). The original comic version has a belt giving him powers, but nowadays full-body power suits with horrendous rotating parts (really, designer?) are popular. Character looks like a firefighter in midlife crisis with the power of technobabble and being insignificant in more ways than just being small.Next up is Firestorm, an otherwise interesting character made uninteresting due to his generic origin and exposition in 'The Flash'. The main theme for Firestorm seems to be to make sure he rarely gets the opportunity to 'combine' in order to cut costs on CGI. Two combat encounters in the pilot alone had the professor and the mechanic kid split up, giving the reason  we don't need your blast-y powers , which stands for  our budget is only sufficient to have you on screen for no more than a couple seconds .Keeping with the theme of low budget, the White Canary is a misrepresented rehash of her 2010 comic version, where the character starred in 6 issues before being put to an early grave. She is a cheap replacement for the Black Canary who had the good sense of not participating in this abortion of a show. Thus, color-inverted canary was designed around the very concept of cheap, giving her a white jumpsuit and two iron bars. Couldn't afford a mask, though.Then we have the bird-couple: Hawkgirl and Hawkman. Their sole reason for being in the show is because their original arch-nemesis, Hath-Set, has been unapologetically merged with Vandal Savage in DC's worst mistake so far. Their gimmick is that they are the only ones capable of killing Savage. Their acting is atrocious, but the studio probably couldn't convince or afford competent actors to play mace-wielding birds.Lastly, Captain Cold and Heatwave. They ran out of characters to take from 'Arrow' and 'The Flash', even after the human rights violation resulting in White Canary. My guess is that their actors (doesn't that term require the ability to act, though?) have excellent managers and now DC can't get rid of them.The big bad guy is Vandal Savage. In light of 'Arrow' and 'The Flash', it surprises me that the big bad isn't a direct copy of the Legends team, perhaps with inverted colors. Then again, Black Canary already exists. However, anything would have been better than to completely and utterly ruin the magnificent character of Vandal Savage. I weep for you, Vandal.To illustrate how bad this show is, here are a few highlights:1. Professor Firestorm drugs the mechanic kid, whom he is intricately linked with, to irreversibly get him to do his bidding. All is forgiven. 2. To show off female empowerment, there is a bar fight scene initiated by a fat crook who wants to rape Canary. It is even worse than it sounds. 3. The black market the team sneaks into is, quite literally, a market. At some point they start to auction off a nuke, but bids are placed by firing a gun at the ceiling. 4. Cold and Heatwave are so edgy, they constantly have to remind the viewer that they are criminals and only want to help the team save the world so they can be better criminals. Every time Snart opens his mouth, another dimension to his character manages to escape. ","1"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-02-17," For those that watch or know of the Flash and the Arrow series, most of us know who they are. No intros are needed and we know about Hawkgirl/Hawkman/Vandal Savage from Arrow/Flash crossover. The only kink in the wheel was Rip Hunter. Being a big fan of Dr. Who and Mr/ Mrs Amy Pond, I think Arthur Darvill does a good job, not knowing anything about the comic book character. I thought it mimicked Dr. Who, maybe that is where they were going with the comic. Just the story is enough to remind me. Time Masters/Time Lord, time spaceship/big blue box that's bigger on the inside. The thing we did not know was Rip's relation to Savage and why he is traveling through time for one man. Savage causes destruction, but maybe more personal than that. I cannot help but wonder if Savage is what Merlin was trying to warn Oliver about. He did not say it outright though. Merlin said that are more things in play than Oliver knows and cannot put Nyssa in charge of the League because Merlin did scoop up some of Salvage at the end of the crossover event. It would be interesting to see how it relates together. The other thing is Gideon. I thought Gideon is built by Barry Allen, but yet Eobard Thawne uses Gideon to keep tabs on the timeline and now Rip Hunter uses Gideon for his ship. I am guessing Gideon is the super- computer for the future where anyone can use it. ","9"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-02-14," Before I start I have to say, I will mention the Arrow and the Flash too in this review.I haven't reviewed anything else because I simply don't hate something as much as I do this and I have to let people know. I don't hate the storyline, what I hate is how they go about it. This series has so much potential, and it's wasted. The thing I hate the most is how stupidly illogical it is that basically everyone survives, no matter how dire the situation. OK yes, Carter died, but the rest of them should be dead by now too. You know Rip takes on Vandal Savage who could barely be defeated by team Arrow and team Flash but he is easily defeated by Rip who has nothing special. No, the thing that annoyed me on top of it all is when the Bounty Hunter came from the future and vaporised 2 kids with a single shot. Extremely accurate and lethal, until of course he shoots Martin Stein, who doesn't vaporise, no he doesn't even get injured for more than 10 seconds.The stupidity of no one dying just makes the series so predictable, why watch? I know everyone will survive, kill Savage and happy ending. That's a joke. If a clear reason why nobody is being killed like they have extreme superpowers, all of them should be dead by now. Exactly the same as Arrow, the first season was good, it was all very logical and everything happened for a reason but then it got stupid, they run towards so many soldiers who are all shooting guns but nobody even gets shot, Arrow somehow beats Slade, who is and exceptional fighter and has Mira Kiru, he beats Ras Al Ghul, who was a better fighter, and no doubt in some stupid way, he will beat Damien Darhk. One example of this is how Damien had the Arrow ip choked with a chain and the Arrow somehow manages to throw an Arrow with enough force while he can't breathe that, Damien, a former league of assassins member couldn't dodge the arrow. The episode of Sara Lance getting her soul back was even more stupid, the writers had to forge some crap out of thin air to get her back, I thought something interesting might happen you know? Thea dies, but no, they just made a magician in their writing out of thin air because why not right? We don't want our main characters to die so let's not let them. The Flash, the only series I like because everything that happens is for a reason and the things behind it are great except one thing, I don't understand why the Flash doesn't just carry his meta-humans into the cage which they can't get out of instead of fighting them? He can do that before they can react can't he? Anyway, I know the Flash will win in some stupid way that they will just bring in, or something that makes no sense will happen and he will beat Zoom. This is just a constant repetition in all the series that I have listed and frankly, it's boring to watch and a waste of time. ","1"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-02-14," While Legends of Tomorrow is better than anything Marvel is doing with their network shows, this is kind of awful by DC TV standards. There is some good. The writing is above average and the production quality is pretty good. The problem is with the acting. Oh my god. It's not good. For some reason they've insisted on focusing on the hawk man and Hawkgirl along with firestorm and white canary, and these are all of the worst actors on the show, maybe even the worst on TV.It's really a shame when they've got actual good actors in Victor Garber, even Dominic Purcell, Wentworth Miller and Brandon Routh are good at playing caricatures of themselves. Compared to Flash, Arrow and even Gotham, this show is underwhelming. ","6"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-02-14," Just as they disappointed in Arrow season 3 and current season 4, so did they here. A good storyline copied from Justice League of America but poorly written for a live action series. A Hawk Girl with over grown teeth who becomes worse when she starts to act. If you want to see Justice League, go watch Justice League of America, if you want to see some unimportant character from DC Universe, go watch Justice League Unlimited. If you are a fan of time traveling watch Doctor Who. If you want to see Mr. Miller and Mr. Purcell watch Prison Break. So dumb series. Highly disappointing. If you are going to copy your plot from a successful cartoon series, do it right. Waste of great actors like Miller, Purcell and Routh. ","5"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-02-13," I really want to love this show, but I am having a heck of a time. I can't even count how many times the freeze and fire guns have been shot, yet I haven't seen anything freeze or burn yet. Dominic and Wentworth are hugely entertaining, I'd even go so far as to say they're the best thing this show has to offer, and damned glad Dom got clear of the cliché bad guy movies he was stuck in for a while, in this, he is fun. These guys have been an item since Prison Break, and I'm thrilled to see them in this.As I write this review, on either side of the screen are BatBen and SuperHenry, reminding me that DC does have some real creativity to offer, though only Henry has any business being in that position IMO.The animation of the past decade, even back to the WB Batman/Superman cartoons, were brilliant, fun and compelling, almost even  believable  as far as that can go.You are missing the boat DC, figure it out fast, or Marvel will just continue to leave you in the dust. It's just not fun when you make glaringly stupid moves after a long, well-planned story-line comes to fruition. I hope it gets better, but since Arrow and Flash seem to continue, I'll bet this does too. There's far worse stuff on TV, and this is still kinda fun. PLEASE TRY HARDER!!! ","5"

What about the black canary who died last season in arrow... we could resurrect her.. GREAT. Then the 2 annoying brother will certainly add to the tension with their awful speechs... And what about those two shitty disguise hawks... yhea and atom guy.. because we need an humoristic average joe which the audience can relate with... NICES. You team are reunite at the top of this building because I need you. You see, in the future (hand gesture to the sky, adding tension) there is this dude who is bad... I need you all to defeat him. If you accept, meet me at this address 'hand over a printed business card'. I need you, HUMANITY NEEDS YOU.... earth need you! we are 10 minutes in the first episodeI stopped watching right there. Was it supposed to be an humoristic show.. Is TV show sinked that low. When i was 9 year old, I imagine stories for my legos.. and I think i manage to get more logic, tension and overall better dialogs than this show. It is 80's Batman or Power Ranger all over again... So cheesy, so lame. What a waste of actors, times and money. Avoid this one like plague. Don't feed stupidity. ","2"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-02-11," I wanted to like the show, even a little but it's very hard. I don't mind arrow, the flash is watchable, supergirl is comical but this show just sucks.Where to start. All of the heroes attacks don't even work on plain humans. The fight scenes are horrible, you see the fire and freeze guns shoot with absolutely no effect on anything, firestorm and atom fare the same. In one scene it looks like the same 10 human security guards are knocked down and thrown back and just rush forward again and again.I feel sorry for the actors, they were decent in the other shows but it didn't seem like they were happy with the dialog or story either. They deserve writers who can write a half decent story. I will not get into plot issues. I could overlook that if it was at least entertaining, but it was just painful to watch.I will force myself to watch the third episode, on the off chance things improve, not expecting anything here.

"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-31," This is a series that I was looking forward to seeing having grown up in the silver age of comics. Although Superman and Co. dominated the DC universe, lesser known titles like Challengers of the Unknown and Rip Hunter, Time Master generally provided a broader range of stories. The original Rip Hunter was not a time-lord style hero from the future with a band of super heroes/villains. He was a contemporary inventor whose creation, the time sphere, allowed him and sever human (but not super) to travel through time. Unfortunately, the new TV show has retconned Rip into something else entirely. It is a fact, however, that writers at DC (and Marvel) seem to have been given carte blanche to retcon at any time to remake any character as they see fit so screw consistency.In any case, the major failing seems to be that we are going to get a band of adventurers pursuing one villain with each episode likely reduced to  we caught up with him, we fought him, and he got away . Then there is the same problem we see frequently in The Flash - the characters forgetting that they have specific weapons/abilities. And not just the so-called heroes. In episode 2, the people at the auction bid by firing their guns in the air but when the fighting breaks out they resort to punching? Too many situations in The Flash could have been resolved quickly if only Barry could remember  hey, I can run really really fast . When the writers assume that the viewers are morons I just stop watching.Doesn't anyone realize that just because Savage is immortal doesn't mean he can't be tied up?Plus I can't help but cringe every time I hear Snart or Rory speak.

"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-31," I have never been a fun of D.C's comics so I don't watch arrow but I watch flash... I also watch the new show legends of tomorrow it's fun and am enjoying it... It has great ratings... I love the cast they are so amazing... Can't wait for the new episodes... My Thursday's not boring anymore!! Awesome. My favorite is captain cold and Sara lance am also beginning to love firestorm one thing I don't like is the hawkgirl and hawk man story but now that hawkman is gone am looking forward to see were that story line will go. Vandal savage plays his role really good I think that role suits him... Am sooo curious to know how episode 3 will be am sooo stocked. I would rather legends of tomorrow than arrow.. ","10"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-30," I don't know what to say. I mean this show is amazing! people should definitely watch it. there are many things that surprises you and makes you excited in the series. the time traveling and super technology got me crazy. everyone has it's own power and the show is nailing it more than Arrow and The Flash! but no one can be Stephen Amell for sure! I actually like kind of supernatural or super power stuffs and this is one of the good ones. I hope the show goes on and the cross overs keep on because seeing them together gives me chills. not to mention that I love seeing Stephen Amell everywhere.they are perfect together. everything about this show is great. I hope you all like it as I did. I didn't like it, I loved it. <U+2665> ","10"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-30," I have used IMDb for about 10 years, it has been great source of reviews and ratings. However, today I joined for the sole purpose of making an adjustment to the ratings. I have no idea how this came to have a rating of about 8-9...its simply terrible. Yes the cast have made great shows in the past, but this show is simply not worth its ratings.For no other reason than to shine light on this injustice, I have joined and given this a rating of 1/10, because I could not give 0/10.I hope they end this show ASAP. Syfy shows are getting worse and worse....that needs to stop. There are great novels which to base the shows on. ","1"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-29," Rip Hunter from the 22 century travels back in time to put together a group of super power beings to stop an evil powerful immortal named Vandal Savage, but will this team learn to work together before it's too late?It's a cool concept even though the team up is not based on a comic book like The Avengers and Justice League, although these characters in the show are well known in the DC universe. Sometimes I feel like I'm watching a mixture of Avengers and Guardians of The Galaxy. The cast do play off each other perfectly, I can tell by watching this that they all are having fun working on this. Even Brandon Routh as The Atom, he basically looks like The Incredible Shrinking Iron Man. Dialog can get clunky in spots, but it is a fun show regardless. I hope it gets better has it goes on. ","8"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-29," Spoilers, don't read if you haven't watched unless you are OK with plot spoilers.If you are looking for DC's answer to all the great Marvel programming out there, this is not it....or even worse...I guess it is. It's the same CW teen-fest hero show, but much worse. The acting is terrible (I'm looking at you former Prison Break brothers, though they are hardly the only guilty ones). The writing is cheesy and childish in it's simplistic stereotype play to each character.. Never mind that DC characters just aren't all that interesting (an Ant Man knockoff played by the former one-off Superman, a pair of criminal brothers with heat and cold ray gun?). The only 2 with an interesting story....are just lame....Hawnkgirl and Hawkman? And the villain is really the only good overall character....which is OK if he is just the best of the group...but he is the only good one on the show. Even the reason they are all together isn't all that compelling. A time traveler on a revenge trip that lies to everyone....but they stick around for episode 2 anyway? The team predictably ignores is warnings about time at every turn. And finally...the CGI.....you get the picture. Just don't waste your time on this one unless you're a super fan of the other CW superhero shows. ","3"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-29," I was really excited about this show. I like all super hero stuff on TV and movies, as I am not informed about the comic books.I watched the pilot, and thought may be I will give it another try. I watched the second episode and decided I will NOT watch it any more.Over acting.Poor story telling.The Sheyara girl is horrible in many aspects. All these super powers and the bad guy seems to do just fine.As early as the second episode the story line got convoluted. I have a feeling this will get worse.I hope I am wrong and others enjoy it. ","4"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-29," This is possibly worse than power rangers. The effects are so,so.but the storyline is so bad a cheesy that you cringe. Only thing worse than the storyline,is the acting.Which make you wonder if they are actually trying to get a razzie award on purpose. I dunno what happened ,but the comics I read my childhood firestorm was a white guy.And him and the professor didn't need to hold hands nor be in the same room. to merge into firestorm. Not to mention he was a kick ass superhero.Here he mostly argue with the professor incessantly Hawk and hawk girl didn't have wings attached to their body. it was attached to a belt. Atoms suit was way less clunky,than what we see in this show. But I guess some of the things have changed or it's a new generation or something.Either way,the chemistry between all of them, are so bad I cringe when they speak or interact with each other. Lest not forget they can't hit a single thing,they shot and blast fireballs and what not.but they can't seem to hit a single person. And as usual they make the female heroes helpless once their man is down. Watching two episodes of this,make me wanna charge em with crimes against humanity ","1"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-29," I love this show! Maybe I'm old enough to know better, but they do entertain me. There's no nudity, profanity, over-the-top blood and gore or any of the things most of the current line-up of shows have. I like the characters, even the cheesy Doctor Who wannabe. I'm not looking for reality TV, crime dramas or trashy comedies. I don't have any unreal expectations about the writers or the story line. The actors can act well enough to present their characters realistically. There's fun tech toys, big explosions and pretty people. That's entertainment. I like having Arrow, Flash and, now, Legends available. They're fun and nothing more. Works for me! ","9"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-29," I'm gonna confess. I was so excited for the premiere of the show, because I love Arrow and The Flash even more, I was almost certain I would love DC's Legends Of Tomorrow. Well, my expectations were a little bit too high, I can't say that I had that feeling as I had watching the first episode of Arrow and The Flash, but it's decent enough and I'm going to stick with this show to see where the plot is heading.I loved the idea of using known characters, but unfortunately, I don't see much dynamic yet, but we're in the beginning, so we must be a little more patience. Time travel was other thing that caught my attention too, so that was the cause for my high expectations. Meanwhile, I felt the first episode kinda of rushed, the events, and even if I have a crush for parenting plots, I'm not sure if the Hunter's plot is strong enough to carry the first season.Even so, I'm going to watch this show evolving and see if it can reach the level of Arrow and The Flash and also be an independent and solid show. ","8"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-29," I've had to pause the second episode in order to write this review, as a sincere fan of Prison Break, as well of Caity and Victor Garber, I find the show acceptable under some terms of changes. I was to find The Flash and Arrow as entertaining works which targets a certain category of fans, although I believed that I might be interested in the world of DC and it was not such a bad decision. My interests are normally related to the direction as well as the performance of the actors which I find fairly fine, I write about Wentworth, Dominic, Victor, Caity and Brandon as well as Arthur. I'm sure by the time I write this, then possible the screenplay has been agreed on at least a full season but my mere advice is to never undermine the minds of those who watch the show since it could be a bit demeaning and rather ridiculous. I encountered many silly events within Arrow and less on The Flash, so I would say Legends of Tomorrow could be a chance to amend the absurdities of which happened on the mentioned shows.I also need to notify that the Egyptian language used within the quick dialogue is a slang modern language which could not be used thousands of years ago, perhaps 1975 and few decades before but not older than this.Thanks, ","7"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-28," I was excited to see my old favorite, Arthur Darvill (Rory Williams - Doctor Who), as a lead - and so many of the B-Team character from Arrow & Flash, finally getting their own show and more development... This is totally FUN! ;o)Perfect? Nothing IS!...But it's so sad to hear so many reviewers on here totally missing the point.1st >>> There are the first-time viewers, that did not see the introduction and development of all these characters, prior to Legends, on Arrow & Flash.2nd >>> There are the comic book readers, who are expecting their comic book characters to be brought to life,  as is , into a live TV series. I am SO glad I don't like comics! I don't have this bias. Anyone who (again) has watched Arrow & Flash, knows these are  adaptions . I liked all of these characters & actors prior to coming into Legends, from watching them on Arrow & Flash. So I was able to watch Legends, hitting the ground running, and just enjoy it....!It also didn't hurt seeing Arthur Darvill act in some 27 episodes of Dr Who, prior. Totally worth the binge watch, if you haven't! What fun seeing a Time Lord ;o) ...errr, sorry,  Master  ...zippin' around time & space, with  Companions , saving the future of the world!...But no super-being, just an ordinary human, with a wife & son, who he just wants to save!For our  comic reading  friends, get over yourselves and  adapt  to the adaptations. For those who are coming into it blind, do us, and yourself, a favor and watch Arrow & The Flash (before complaining) ....For the rest of us, we're just going to settle in with our popcorn and ENJOY! ;o) ","9"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-28," From the point view of someone who didn't read comics all his life,but likes superhero movies and series,this one is just horrid. I know it has been just one episode ,but it is so lame it just can't keep your attention. The conversations are predictable,the one liners are just boring, and I am sorry but these are superheroes who will save the world - when their time travel ship got attacked,the fire-dude ( the professor and the other guy fused together) and the other flying dude could not hit the time-headhunter guy to save their lives. They literally we spraying fire and whatever the other dude shoots all around him,but couldn't hit him . If I was that bad at my job ,as they are bad at superheroing ,I would be fired. :D I saw Jessica Jones,and that was interesting through the season, the Flash was OK, I never liked green arrow, so I guess if someone is a fan of those,he will like Legends of Tomorrow also, but for the average Joe,I don't think it sparks interest,it is just badly made. ","3"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-28," The show is very ambitious, the marketing did a good job with the hype and they painstakingly set up the premises over a long time in the Arrow and Flash shows. I was looking forwards to seeing ATOM in action as we got very little of him, I liked how Vandal Savage and Hawkgirl were introduced in Flash but the first episode was a complete mess. First of all there are way too many character on screen at the same time for anything meaningful to occur.I think that people who have not seen Flash or Arrow before will have an even harder time to make sense of all the characters but even will after seeing those shows the plot and directing is just average at best. The show cant pace itself out right, sets some grand scale premises but then gets tangled in its own web and the climax fight with Chronos is simply brain numbing - it just an excuse to see all 9 characters shoot at something(and by miracle missing and getting their asses kicked despite being a 9vs1 fight against a guy that has an armor and gun). I would like to see this show get off the ground but it's very unlikely since I think the director of the show just cant pull it off. ","6"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-28," Simply put, the shows initial hype had me intrigued. I'm a huge fan of DC and Marvel, but if this is the best black actor they could find to portray the character the show designated as  Firestorm  aka Jax, DC should stop letting comics be converted by The CW, as it destroys any hope of remaining remotely true to the comics' integrity. I understand script and directing issues may have their hand in some of the problems with this show, the acting by Drameh is no better than an elementary school play, and he very well may be a decent actor....somewhere. Save us O'lord, from Firestorm. He's just so.....so....bad. That being said, the show as a whole is all over the place. The plot, , the writing, the acting, the CGI, and the delivery seemed to be tossed randomly into the air, hoping for something good to fall back to earth. I'll admit was kind of stoked that Purcell and Miller were together again after Prison Break, but I don't know how to view the character roles yet. It is definitely a kids show, and I suppose that is no surprise given The CW is a teeny-bopper network. If this theatrical mess continues on its current path, I'd be surprised if it lasts an entire season. It seems like the show was rushed, like the crew of the show needed a payday loan. I really wanted to like the show and I encourage giving this show a chance because everyone's taste is different, but user beware, you may find yourself throat punching someone afterward. ","3"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-27," So you have the avenger's B team... or is it C team? probably D team or lower...Anyway these are the ones that get an episode or two in the regular series and then a few guest appearances if they're lucky.Put them all together with a time lord errrr traveler, totally meant to say traveler! and have them go through time trying to stop a manic before he rules the world.The plot line sounds like a goofy fan fiction written by a tween and has the usual GLARING problem time travel causes (a person died? go back an hour and save them then? plan failed? you have a time machine with zero limitations USE IT!!!!) but oddly enough, it works and most of it comes from the characters and actors.Heatwave (from the Netflex series the flash) is funny, not sure if most of it was intentional or not but once he opens his mouth you'll end up falling for him!The old prof. from the duo firestorm (again from the flash series) steals the show... though I'm not sure about some of the choices his character makes. still lovable and you get invested in him.The rest all have their moments and are actually likable. I'd say this show is off to a VERY good start! (regadless of the childish plot)One problem I see with the show is the two that are supposed to be the main leads, hawkman and girl. they're boring as white bread. Seriously all they do is pose for the camera and have zero presences. Take them out of the show and you won't even miss them! hopefully they actually get a personality later because from their show and this one all they seem to be is a plot device .... also if they can actually give us a reason for the time travel thing (like really that bit is so childish!) that would make sense... it's already istablished that the traveler is human and not an almight time lord that can see beyond the ripples of time so why not jump back in time to 5 minutes before your family is killed and get them out of there?Keep an eye out for the D team, This one has potential despite the overly childish plot! can go well or burn in flames! ","8"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-26," ... and he wants his trench coat back.So here we have a stylish but disgraced time lord with a British accent who has stolen a time machine / spaceship and travels with companions to find adventure. Is there anything about Doctor Who they forgot to steal for that character?At least the stolen material makes sense, something that can't be said about any other aspect of the show.The entire plot of the first episode was about finding someone who could place Vandal Savage at some place in time, but they already had Hawkman, who could provide more than just a guess about where Savage would be, throughout all of post-Egyptian history.And then there was the big fight scene. If this super-team can't take down a single Boba Fet knock-off (and that line from Captain Cold was almost worth sitting through the rest of the show to get to. Almost...), what hope could they possible have of defeating the main baddie? I don't think it's a sure thing they will even win all of their bar fights.If your taste in entertainment is unsophisticated you may find entertainment here. For those of you older than 12, best to look elsewhere. ","2"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-26," Just ignore every single freaking annoying negative comment about this show and watch it. The first episode, and people are already being annoying as ****. I might sound biased, but I was really excited and waited SO LONG to watch this show, and it payed off. I screamed a couple of times because it felt so much like watching the Avengers again, only on the small screen, mixed with my favorite Arrow and Flash characters, combined with that of a  Star Wars  and  Dr. Who  feel to it. The first episode already had me thinking  Wow, this show is gonna be freaking amazing!  They show a dystopia future with a Star Wars type setting and people firing laser blasts and killing people. On top of that, they have Vandal FREAKING Savage (emphasis on Savage) practically murdering a 5 yr old on screen! You can tell just by the first 3 minutes that this show isn't gonna be boring at all! Plus TIME TRAVEL!! Imagine being able to see Star City and Central City in the future! The fight sequences were amazing and the CGI looks amazing on a TV budget. Had this been a show set sometimes in 2001 or 2000, it would have looked pretty crappy (Just watch Smallville and Charmed during their flying sequences and compare it to this show, and don't get me wrong, I loved those 2 shows as well). What really sells it, is that they're able to pull off A FREAKING superhero that can shrink down to microscopic size, and on top of that, it being an Iron Man parody that is Brandon Routh playing Ray Palmer in an EXOSUIT! (Agents of Shield has no excuse for not being able to get Iron Man on the show now). It's an amazing show, first episode and I'm already hooked. If people are looking for a Breaking Bad or a Walking Dead type super violent show, or a  Realistic  show, than I suggest you watch something else cause your not getting it here. Oh and you negative reviewers, go **** yourselves. ","10"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-26," It was painful to watch the first episode of Legends of Tomorrow. Plot holes in the first episode. Bad acting. Bad CGI and a boring story.Took a lot of willpower just to finish one episode, DC should stick to animated movies...The humor was predictable and childish. Rip hunter; I am from London oh and the future..... that is probably the worst line I ever heard in anything from DC. It was brought as supposed to be funny but was incredibly cringe worthy. White Canary looks ridiculous. As does Ray Palmer's suit.Let's try and end with a positive note, I did like Randal Savage. ","2"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-25," My observations from the Pilot: 1. Very predictable. For every one person who wants to join the mission, one says no. Maybe hurried writing?2. I loved Caity Lotz (Sara) in the Arrow, but her acting seems wooden here. But her stunts were bad-ass.3. Victor Garber seems the most genuine in his role. He fits it perfectly. What a great actor. 4. Dominic Purcell/Heat Wave is more muscle and less anything else. At least now. I understand Captain Cold/ Wentworth Miller in the team but Heat Wave makes no sense, considering there's already Firestorm, and Heat Wave isn't the brightest of the bunch!5. It has it's twists, however small. I loved how they show heroes want to matter in history.6. I know my title says it's a mix of Dr. Who and Avengers but it is original. Just hoping they don't waste the potential on too much drama and include big time travel jumps and a lot of action. ","8"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-25," Its new so all the actors are finding their way with the characters as usual with all new series. You can accept that and move on but from the off its quite apparent that this is aimed at kids/families and not a more mature audience. So if you are looking for something to watch that you can enjoy with the kids its a good watch but if you are looking for something more akin to the Marvel movies you will be disappointed.The writing is about what you would expect too for family drama. As an example of this it doesn't expect you to question why the time traveler, Captain Hunter, when he states he has collected the 8 greatest people in history to become legends why wouldn't he recruit Iron Man.......Thor.......Spider Man.....Aqua Man.....O.K maybe not Aqua Man but you get my point. Just sit back and gloss over the plot holes and enjoy it with the kids. Its like someone took Dr.Who and mashed it together with Marvel Heroes in a very a typical Hollywood styling and hey voila you have this.When I say its for kids I mean think Dr.Who for kids not Power Rangers for kids so as I say this will appeal to some but not for anyone looking for a serious comic book TV flick. ","5"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-25," Am I missing something here? I don't watch Doctor Who. Is this Doctor Who meets Justice League? Why is this so awful? Every character is unlikable. They go back in time and take on social injustice? They're not even fighting super villains anymore? Half the cast changed after the first season. This is a huge mess. If this is considered good for the genre (the genre of sci-fi time hopping) then I must dislike the genre itself.If they didn't tie into the Flash and the Arrow I wouldn't watch this. I guess I'm just not into watching people play dress up from other eras and using historic characters like name-dropping so to keep the audience captivated. Lazy writing. But even the sci-fi stuff looks cheap and lazy. Talking spaceship. Poo. This show is a big failure.I'd suggest going and watching Agents of Shield. ","2"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-24," This looks to be building to a series as enjoyable as flash/arrow/supergirl.The fact that it's getting negative review is a good thing, it shows it's embracing DC comics universe history of time-travel and multiple earths to deliver a gem to the fans, and that vocal idiots aren't going to appreciate it because they'll just never get it.This series has the potential to embrace all the amazingly complex Infinite stories that made DC comics a hit from the 70's onwards. Given Marvel is outdoing them on the realism front, it makes sense to embrace their more out-there storytelling which wired for them in the past.That said it's fun, easy to get into, action pact, and flows from Arrow/Flash, so anyone should be able to get into it and enjoy it. Unless they get their jollies moaning on IMDb, but at that point there's no hope. ","8"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-24," I grew up reading comics with Atom, and Hawkman and Hawkgirl so I was pretty stoked when I saw the previews for this show. (Firestorm and Black Canary's sister weren't around then but they are interesting characters). Since becoming a fan of the Flash and Supergirl TV shows, having another DC series was an exciting prospect. Then I watched the show's first episode. Meh... Complaints? The Atom I knew didn't have a power suit that makes him into a DC clone of Iron Man. That is the first one. The second one, and it is my main reason for ditching the show after 1 episode is this: (spoiler alert for 1st episode): If the group couldn't even defeat the Bounty Hunter Chronos, how the H*** are they going to stand a chance against Savage? I mean, come on! Hawkgirl and Hawkman both hit Chronos with their Nth metal maces and it barely knocks him down. Then Capt. Hunter hits him with a laser gun. No affect. Then Snart and Rory run into him with a car. Knocks him down. Next, Firestorm fires energy blasts at him along with Snart and Rory's cold and fire guns. Nada. Lastly, the ship, which has weapons, runs rather than fight a single entity on the ground with a hand-held weapon? And, oh yeah, why were Dr. Stein and Dr. Boardman each hit with a blast from Chronos' weapon and yet Stein wasn't even singed yet Boardman dies? This dysfunctional group couldn't beat anyone so let's quit pretending they are up to the task. As always, make the superheros' powers worthless until the last battle and then suddenly they will prevail - that is the tired formula that will probably be used for this series so save your DVR space for something worthwhile.

"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-24," To be honest, with the exception of Arrow Season 1, the tone and direction of  Arrow  and  Flash  remind me of  Smallville . They are all full of this teeny American cheesy feel-good-factor that gets on my nerves. So disappointed to have to say that  Legends of tomorrow  manages to be even worse.The first 10 minutes are so unbelievably rushed. No story or background build up, apart from seeing a terrorised city and a kid being killed by a B-rate villain. A villain who doesn't even strike any kind of charisma. I am wondering why the hell is he the main villain, when there were so many they could have chosen...Time travelling? Seriously? Couldn't the producers have come up with something a bit more original?? And just like your Smallville, Arrow and Flash, everything is so conspired to the point of sickly sweet, with characters behaving totally against their usual selves.Maybe this commercial product is good enough for teens but any self-respecting DC fan will steer clear of it. An absolute disgrace. I might as well be watching  Mutant X  all over again ","1"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-24," If you watch this kind of show, then you know which one this series is attempting to copy. As my thirteen-year-old son told me, after we saw the first episode,  master  is a synonym for  lord. In a forced attempt to make this one somehow different from Greg Berlanti's other three shows ( Arrow,   Flash,  and  Supergirl ), this one apparently includes attempted comedy. It doesn't work very well because, first, all four of these clones have their characters tossing snarky lines around, so the contrast isn't very stark, and, second, the silly things they say do contrast internally: with the serious things they say. It's as though the characters alternate between short speeches about the grandeur of their individual destinies, and the silliness inherent in asking a nerd if he's ever played football.On top of all that, there is a serious plot flaw that appears at the end of the first episode, which (no spoilers here) forces the viewer to accept the idea that all of these people will agree to something that at least a few of them would realize might be a very bad idea. It is simply not believable. (I know, that's a word with little application to a show about comic book superheroes, but there are lines, and there are lines, right?)For context, I would score the foursome this way:Arrow, 8.0 (trending down)Supergirl, 7.5 (trending up)Flash, 7.0 (trending flat)Legends of Tomorrow 4.0 (but I'll watch two more, at least)Note: I went to a science fiction convention a week ago. One of the discussion panels was about how so many of us are suffering from  superhero overload  from TV shows like this one. It was a popular panel, with the consensus being very, very one-sided. I sense the end is near for a lot of this stuff, at least on TV. ","4"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-23," It is quite a great show because in the beginning starting with Arrow back from season 1 since 2012 and then The Flash came since 2014. Slowly after these 2 shows has started, it slowly building up everything such as the timeline between one show and another show. Also the 2 shows started a crossover which lasted for only 2 episodes for each season so far. Was surprised about who the team members were and the future was good especially how the wormhole was done with good CGI among with other special effects. Was also quite surprised about how the year started in the far future and went back in time. This would be a great show to watch along with surprises that will be in the 16 episodes for this season and possible beyond. ","10"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-23," This is quite literally the most poorly written pilot of any show I have seen in a decade. The story is poorly adapted from the concept of Dr. Who. The writing not only lacks any sense of direction, but it also makes every character utterly detestable. You could find better acting in Adam Sandler's Ridiculous 6 (in other words, it is the worst acting on television). The only bright spot in the show is that it obviously has a huge production budget and therefore the scenery and special effects are well done.Do not waste your precious time on this show, you can never get it back. Unless America has dropped its standards to a new low, this show will not be renewed for a second season. ","1"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-23," I like to give any fantasy / sci-fi series or movie a chance, but Legends of Tomorrow makes it hard from episode one.For me the actors were mediocre at best. The guy playing Captain Hunter overacted a lot and the rest were given too little time to actually care about in the first episode.The directing, writing and effects seem quite underwhelming in general. The plot is forced by making time travel and those that 'master' it seem ridiculous as well as pulling off a new team in a contrived manner with little logic behind it.Especially the 'big battle' was lame. Atom and Fireguy shooting randomly making sure not to hit the enemy, Hawkcouple hitting him and then flying off when he's on the ground. The entire scene was done rather poorly. Worse of all were the people running in a straight line when a supposed bounty hunter is shooting at them and then not being hurt when getting shot (except for the expandable character) ... I thought we were past this kind of fight scenes for over two decades.I also have a hard time seeing a future for this show given the premise of killing 'facial hair man' kind of puts an end date on the show from the very start, ironic for a time travel show with limitless possibilities to chose from.The only things I liked from the first show were the bar fight, the hot chick, the hot actors and the backstory of Hawkcouple and facial hair man, although the latter could have been given a bit more depth.Hawkgirl still needs flying lessons apparently, I hope she can help the series rise to a new level or it's doomed to fall to a bloody death sooner than later.

"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-23," (contains harmless spoilers)this is my first review. i am writing this because of the criticism being faced by this series. I have been a DC fan since i watched Superman: the animated series when i was three. Introduction to justice league and arrowverse have only made me a greater fan. As the pilot was telecast 12 hrs after the US telecast, i sat back and watched it. trust me, it lives up to the expectations. i will just list the pros and cons:PROS: -Arthur Davill is great as Rip Hunter -White Canary's bar fight feat. heatwave and captain cold -Character development of Ray Palmer -The special effects -the twists and turns -hawkman and hawkgirl have strong presence -lots of characters so lots of varietyCons: -Vandal Savage is underwhelming -CW divides the pilot keeping most of the action for next week(main reason for mixed reviews) -the death of the guest star is not a big issue, even his mother doesn't care -some scenes are ended in gibberish due to uneven pacingi don't think legends is trying to be a TV series in top ten lists. it is a good show with a bumpy start but a lot of promising adventures. Not every sci-fi has to be as good as battlestar galactica or firefly. Some are watched for their craziness. ","10"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-23," If you love Arrow and the Flash you are absolutely going to love this also. The pilot was great and it showed how Rip hunter assembles his team and their first time travel most of which has already been shown in the trailers.. People might say the Special effects are bad, but for the budget of a TV show they've done a splendid work.Some might pit this against Daredevil or Jessica jones. But those are more grounded shows. This is a Fun time travel show and uses the same formula which made everyone love the Flash. Don't look at the bad reviews you cannot please everybody, it's only the pilot and there's much more to come. My opinion is that it'll live up to the Hype. No surprise there cause it's a spin off of two of the best TV shows. Go watch it, you'll love it.. :) ","10"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-22," It's odd to see legendary premise from Seven Samurais implemented with supporting heroes from DC Universe and time travel gimmick. This is similar to a sport team made out of benchwarmers, without being too rude, and it can be disjointed at times. However, the theme of being better than the destined supporting roles resonate in rather realistic fashion for these misfits and its bombastic approach is surprisingly fun in contrast of trending gritty vibe for superheroes nowadays.Brandon Routh, formerly Superman, now goes by the name of Atom is a welcomed addition. He has good screen presence and it's nice to see him don another superhero suit in more prominent role. Wentworth Miller and Dominic Purcell once again become brothers years after their Prison Break time together. They've done this before and it seems they find comfortable place among the crew.Victor Garber, the half part of Firestorm and Caity Lotz, now White Canary are proper additions. Garber has done so many roles similar to this and he fits the mentor personality, while Lotz looks fine for the tough female character. She is athletic for the part, she's also gradually separating herself from love interest character into a more establish one. Arthur Darvill as the new lead Rip Hunter looks enigmatically resembling Constantine, though he seems decent for the glue that keeps the band together.These are the most likely to have chemistry across times. Unfortunately, this type of gathered heroes gig needs everyone to play their part. The Hawk duo is still inconsistent, they lack connection and the level or refined acting, and this is more visible when they play important part on the plot. Franz Drameh, the face of Firestorm has not meshed well with the rest either, the character looks too forced even if he's paired with more experienced Victor Garber.For visual candy purpose, they haven't skimped on the production. Effects from The Flash and Arrow translate well here. Atmosphere is leaning towards The Flash's lighter ambiance as the show gives more time for humor, thus the inevitable corny one-liner. Few of these appear highly flashy and haphazardly thrown together, although they are entertaining to have nonetheless.The assembly from lesser characters can be risky and hectic, yet the better parts of the production and cast present an enjoyable ride. Besides, it's always good to watch the talented actors given more spotlights and experience a more merry leisure than melancholy or melodramatic shows. ","7"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-22," The plot, music, production, and cinematography is as you'd expect - EXCEPT for the flow of quality acting. Two 'actors' in particular are painful to listen and watch, because they're fish out of water when interacting with the other pro actors: - Franz Drameh (Firestorm) - Falk Hentschel (Carter).Let's start with Franz. His inability to act is obvious. He needs to go to acting school (or return there). He has little to no confidence in his speaking abilities and overcompensates for this by shaking or nodding his head with a stretched smile at the beginning (or end) of every sentence. HE'S NOT READY TO ACT.Falk is a disaster. He should stick to voice animation and not acting. He doesn't enunciate (speak clearly) and speeds through his sentences. His facial expressions hardly even change - and just like Franz, NOT READY FOR ACTING. Just because Falk is 'hot & ripped' doesn't mean he's prepared for the big screen. So prepare to be disappointed with 'Legends of Tomorrow'. ","3"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-22," After the pilot it seems like the same thing again with similar color palate of Arrow and Flash. Do we really need another series to cross over? Why not just have these characters in Arrow or Flash? They are both running out of ideas. The only difference is the time travel element. It's great to have Caity Lotz again in a series - killing her off in Arrow was a terrible mistake so they had to bring her back. Brandon Routh is okay as supporting cast in Arrow not sure about leading a series. The British actor Darvill is a bit common - couldn't they get someone more charismatic? From what I've seen so far I don't think it's worth the time investment. ","5"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-22," It's difficult writing this review as I am a big DC fan and was anticipating this show for a while. But from a critical perspective, this show definitely utilizes some of the lesser known DC characters and groups them together in a new superhero offering, with a certain degree of success.The story-line is not too difficult to follow, and the first episode certainly paints a picture of things to come, so I am quietly optimistic the concept will deliver. There are plenty of angles to explore with the idea of time travel, so hopefully this show has proved it has created an unusual yet refreshing team worth watching.There are some downfalls - some of the dialogue seems strained, and at this early stage there isn't a lot of character interaction, much like a JLA comic from the 1950's. I am personally not a fan of having Captain Cold nor Heatwave on the show, as their combination of sneering and screaming acting is somewhat cringe-worthy. I would've preferred to see some of the lesser known JLA instead, such as Vixen or Zatanna.Brandon Routh seems to be the standout star of the show as his character is the most likable and appealing. The rest of the cast...well, time will tell.The makers of this show have done a thorough job and it shows. I am hopeful this show will create a whole new direction in superhero television programs.

"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-22," First off, I loved comicbook movies/shows ESPECIALLY if it has a connected universe. I been watching the CW universe unfold on Netflix so as soon as I heard this was happening, I knew I couldn't wait for it to come onto Netflix 9 months later.I have currently watched Arrow seasons 1-3 and The Flash season 1, both shows as great as this one. So I had not watched a single Arrow season 4 or The Flash season 2 episode at all, and started immediately watching Legends of Tomorrow without that helpful knowledge AND STILL understood what was happening without being lost.The pilot episode has a great intro showing the level of damage Vandal Savage can do, making the world into a dystopia. It sets up the villain really well here and what the point of the show is as well. This show is like The Avengers with Time travel.10/10 ","10"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-22," Another silly TV show of DC..the writing and the fight scenes are for laughs. As about visually the sgi was terrible.. I bet in a few episodes will become cheesy soap opera TV like arrow,smallville and pretty much everything predictable that DC is serving to its teenager viewers. Let's be honest now..can you compare that fight scenes, acting and writing with all the amazing Marvel TV shows out there?..NO. The Hawks are really annoying,an ex Superman that nobody liked, all though DC doesn't care about it..and they used him again,the 2 ex prison break brothers with their annoying speech problem they have, arrow's ex girlfriend who died in arrow and got resurrected,a doctor who character and the duo firestorm..and tah tah...we have a boring predictable super hero new TV show.

"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-22," It's true... these are the characters that are widely forgettable. Don't get me wrong, I liked Palmer in Arrow and I even like Stein, but Firestorm was better with Ronnie than with  Jax.  Hell, I even enjoyed Snart as a bad guy even though his dialogue and mannerisms were very cartoony. But for the rest... I never liked Sarah Lance, Heatwave is a very one-dimensional pun, Jax (the lesser half of Firestorm) is whiny and obnoxious, and the Hawk-duo are horrendous. For one (this is nit picking and probably in bad taste) I can't get past her mouth and how big her teeth are... I honestly find it distracting. Also, on the same note: why does Sarah Lance always look like she's trying to do  duck- face?  What is it with the CW and employing actresses with good bodies but weird faces? Anyway... The story idea at heart is good, but it loses momentum when you learn is a personal vendetta with Rip Hunter. It would have been better if the time council wanted Vandal Savage dealt with. The script is awkward like Arrow has become. Arrow was good until all of the good writers left and went to Flash. Nothing feels natural and most of the dialogue feels exposition-y. The only saving grace is that it removes so many annoying characters from Flash And Arrow and locks them in this world to never bother us again. But I did like Palmer and wish he would come back to Arrow. Overall, bad show. I'll keep watching just because I have now seen the first episode and feel compelled to keep watching to keep up continuity with the other two shows because I bet there's going to be cross-overs.

"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-22," Yes, SOME OF IT is kind of for kids...But I loved it!!! Though I wish it gets more  mature  with time. There are good actors here, so there's a lot of potential for good drama and character development, too. Still, there are just a couple of things I didn't like. I mean, Chronos is just ONE villain and not even a couple of them could hit him ONCE...That's just...not good. If one of them can't even hit the mark once, why did Rip Hunter got them together? They're supposed to be good!!! Another thing is that some of the dialogue can be a bit cheesy...SOOOO, those are the couple of things...Everything else is just perfect. There was one person here who said that if Rip had the Time Machine he could've gone back in time just to save his child and his wife and leave with them. But then, what good would that do if Savage is out there in the world ready to obliterate everyone? And Rip said, that fate and time somehow are bound together...So, in order to change the future, well, it's just really hard, hence going back to bring some  superheroes . Anyway, I LOVED IT!!!! I want more and I want more from the characters! More action, drama and character development...If it gets to cheesy and fun, then it will go down...BUT I have faith that that will NOT HAPPEN!!!! THE DC LEGENDS WILL ROCK!!! ","9"
"Legends of Tomorrow",2016-01-22," Having waited over 7 months to see this show, it's fair to say this show has definitely lived up to, and beyond all expectations! Being a very big fan of the sister shows, Arrow and The Flash it was very interesting to see where exactly this show would fit in. Providing amasses of light and fun humour with a very enjoyable, albeit dysfunctional, superstar team completely changes the scene of superhero TV. The characters themselves are very easy to relate to as is the villain himself, Vandal Savage. A great decision to bring back Arrow character, Sara Lance to the cast as well as others from the previous two shows, giving the show a great sense of familiarity if you do watch the other two, but not so that you'd feel out of place in the slightest if you don't watch the other two. Honestly I believe this show is definitely one to check out, I really wouldn't be able to find any flaws so far. When watching it, due to the shorter season and therefore bigger budget, the show gives off the appearance of a Hollywood blockbuster. Marc Guggenheim and Andrew Kreisberg have done it again and brought us a show with brilliant special effects, great scripts and just all round badass-ery! :) ","10"
