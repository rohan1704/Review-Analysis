"The Flash",2017-06-28," I can understand wanting to tinker with things to make a story work, but it is not the kind of thing that us comic fans really appreciate. I grew up on the Batman and Superman animated series' and went from there to Justice League and then started on some of the comics. And when you start overhauling characters in a way that might be taken as politically motivated, people get grouchy. The changes to Wonder Woman and Miss Marvel are exemplary of this.But, I digress. I think rehashing the Barry Allen flash was a mistake in the first place, especially using old cast members from the first show to give it validation in the eyes of old fans. The only good thing that came out of the 90s flash was Mark Hamill started voicing the Joker soon after. Wally West was the comical flash that a lot of us grew up with and if you want to give us something new, give us a live action Jay Garrick main character, or maybe Bart Allen, arguably one of the best speedsters. Don't re- modulate and alter an existing work that has been done in live action already out of laziness.P.S. The OCD among us nerds also tend to not like changes to minor characters near our favorite hero, as their interactions shape the hero. ","4"
"The Flash",2017-06-28," I enjoyed Flash the first 3 seasons.However I am hoping few changes that seems to be repetitive and kind of annoying in all episodes. First, Iris has to shut her mouth or die rather than telling some dialogues like 'You can do it Barry' or 'I am sorry Barry' every episode. Whenever something bad is happening to the world or some super villains killing people, flash, Joe west or iris do not seem to care about the people at all. These three keep telling to each other,' I just want you to be safe..blah blah' seems to be repetitive. They should show some genuine concern to the people.Other than this, Flash is definitely enjoyable.. ","8"
"The Flash",2017-06-26," Boring and incredibly illogical. Outstanding acting from some, clashes so hard with dull and badly acted scenes from others. Unappealing characters, a constant nerdy feel and cringy sense of humor makes this series and absolute waste of time for me. Unpopular opinion, but here it is. ","3"
"The Flash",2017-06-26," i mean yes there are more TV shows such as: Arrow,Supergirl etc. But this one is simply the best.It has all the drama all the excitement and i loved every single moment of it.And the finales of all the seasons are amazing.The best finale was season 3.I was ready to see Iris die and i wasn't very sad.But to see H.R. take her place was very sad for me because he was such a fun character no matter how many times he did the wrong thing.And his love for coffee was as big as his love for a very special girl.Season 1 was a great starting point and kicked off amazingly.It was a great unexpected season from beginning to end. Season 2 was very fun but how many times Flash doubted himself was a bit annoying.Season 3 was the best turnaround.The season started badly because they kept milking the fact he can time travel.And how many times he was told not to travel trough time,then he knows he shouldn't but still does,is beyond enough.And so i said to myself this season wont be good.And i was very disappointed with what the writers did.But the final 2 episodes saved the season,no matter how bad episodes 1- 21 were.It was all saved by episode #22 and #23.The big turnover with H.R. taking Iris' place was amazing and very well done,i didn't even see it coming and then with flash going to the speed force and Iris losing her husband was a great scene and to top of a very emotional series.

"The Flash",2017-06-24," THIS REVIEW CONTAINS SPOILERSIn season 1 I didn't have a show I really like but then Tge Flash came along and instantly captivated me with the characters and story line. The plot twists were fantastic and the writing was on point. Overall that season is 10/10.Unfortunately, Season 2 couldn't keep it that way, it became confusing at points. A prime example of this was the episode  The Reverse Flash Returns  in which they attempted to explain what the heck a time remnant was, something I still have trouble getting my head around, it is also now used for plot convenience. Zoom was a decent villain up until he was unmasked which made him less frightening, plus his backstory sucked, he didn't really have a reason to be a villain. The acting was still good though thankfully, although another downside was Wally he was extremely annoying for many of his episodes. Overall an 8/10.This trend of declining quality continues in season 3, with a highly disappointing Flashpoint episode. The first half of the season was incredibly boring, the writers pretty much took the characters and made them opposite of who they are. Cisco was depressed and hated Barry for the first half making it really stink. Not to mention Barry was depressed and angsty the entire season. One positive was Killer Frost but even that had issues because why the heck does she have to be evil? Many things were left unexplained. This season also has ANOTHER speedster villain in Savitar the self proclaimed god of speed. He pretty much looked like the live child of Sauron and Megatron. Then the writers decided to wait until the final four episodes to reveal Savitar's identity, and at that point nobody cared. Now some major spoilers begin. The reveal that Barry's time remnant was Savitar was so stupid to be honest, after he was revealed he was seen for five minutes outside of the suit towards the beginning of the following episode. And didn't show up for a bit later. Not to mention HR, the newest Wells, he was extremely annoying and over the top. Then there was WestAllen, something I felt bogged the season down a bit. Tracy Brand now has really no purpose in the show now too so why did they really need to bring her on? Tom Felton though was the best thing in this season, he was great until his character became Caitlin's new love interest. I could go on but overall I give the season a 7/10, the musical episode saved the season from a 6/10.The show is by all means entertaining but it has a problem that they always try to top the previous season, thus bogging down the entire season. The show is overall an 8/10 ","8"
"The Flash",2017-06-22," If you wanted to see a version of flash with an always whining yammering, obtuse flash, an irritating Iris, tons of cringe inducing, awful acting, heaps of inconsistent plot lines, and a bunch of unlikable main characters (except for Cisco) then this is the show for you. ","2"
"The Flash",2017-06-21," I watch this show only because it is nice change to see Candice Patton in role of Iris. I think her acting is good,her face expression and voice are really relaxing change on TV shows and I believe she only needs a little bit of improvement when her character survives tragic events. That can make her a top actress of all time. Candice is only positive what I can say about this.Negatives: first- Flash should need more superpowers if his costume has holes like this. Else he IS dead, and all we see is his last flashes in his head before he died... He needs Superman skin and tissue to survive,or covered face to survive his own speed... Second- when Eddie died-that should be end not only of Reversed Flash- that should be same end like in the end of season 2-his mother was never killed, he always lived with them. Yeah, they tried to invent  fixed  points but be born ,or not, is fixed point...BTW I find time travel theories made up,like this story, because there are always some out of context explanation,but that is another story. Third-I find really funny how people around FLash are so slow in mind- he is too very slow. I couldn't stop laugh how many times Iris didn't find out who is Flash, also Patty had a lot of time to figure out, his  brother , his boss... Come on ,man run out before you and he came in other clothes form other side, and you are so stupid to not recognize him? Also,I can't believe how many villains get into Star-lab and how they don't have any measures to prevent attacks? Flash can't prevent anyone to shoot innocents from 3 meters range, but he can stop bullets when Joe tried to shoot  Reverse Flash  double? Guy shot him by slowest gun in history-gun making ice-and Flash didn't move? OK, I know this is show for teens, but really guys... You didn't invent his physical limits in story,only he needs to eat several times more than earlier... There is only one good written character-Joe... Come on... ","3"
"The Flash",2017-06-20," First thing off, the cast members are great <ed><U+00A0><U+00BD><ed><U+00B1><U+008D> but the storyline? Not so great. The story is the same old just like the previous episodes just diff. People and villain. There's no suspense or thrilling in the story. It's like we already what's gonna happen. A great example is when they like to hide things from supposedly team and in the end they're like, we trust and need each other. Like? That's how the script gonna go? I mean I think I just saw it on the last season. Oh and the fact that he could've done things in the first place which he did before. But hey I'm not a writer right? I'm just one of the million people watching it, I think that's why I stopped watching it. Same reason why I watching Arrow. The storyline and script needs to get better or the show might not last long as it wanted to be. Bec. I noticed it how many people you would think would noticed it too and get bored with it? Ps. The rating is for the show storyline and script. Not the cast members. ","2"
"The Flash",2017-06-12," awful, after catching other meta humans Flash preaches them good and they won't listen to him, this happens every time, completely bored by the repetition, he neither completely eliminates them nor cure them , completely lost the plot and Caitlin has one expression, i couldn't really understand whether she is laughing or crying. Barry Allen even he is terrible actor and utter nuisance when he does few things, worries for non-sense.Horrible, right from start of season2 ","1"
"The Flash",2017-06-04," I just love this show. It's amazing sci-fi, I love the action in this show, I love IRIS :D , I love everything. I really recommend this. Although some episodes are just plain nonsense, because nothing happens in them, rest of them are perfect. I also like that Flash is part of The Arrowverse, so there are crossovers with Arrow, Supergirl, Legends of tomorrow. I'm not sure about season 4 after seeing ending of season 3. I just hope they will not ruin the show. ","9"
"The Flash",2017-05-03," lost interest in this show after Barry revealed his identity to Iris. After that moment the show become ridiculous. The writers have lost the plot Too many speedsters, The Earth 2 narrative, lack of imagination, and the fact those associated around Allen have developed super powers are a few reasons why we do not waste any time watching this poorly written TV Show. What started out reasonable, different and actually not too bad, until!! what i can only assume, writers of another horrible TV Show,  The Arrow  have obviously been recruited to write episodes for The Flash and the outcome is laughable far fetched and ultimately awful. ","1"
"The Flash",2017-05-01," Without a doubt, The Flash is an accomplished series with great writing, direction and acting. It does seem like it was made by fans, for fans and regardless whether you like superhero stories or not, or maybe you're a sci-fi fan or not, the core of the series is the great story-telling and the characters; you will enjoy it. Anchoring the ensemble cast is Grant Gustin who has quite the acting range; the man has talent and he wears the role of Barry Allen with great panache. Other main cast members are equally strong, with Tom Canavagh (Harrison Wells) filling in multiple roles throughout 3 seasons, Jesse L Martin (Det. Joe West) as the father figure, Carlos Veldes (Cisco) and Danielle Panabaker (Caitlyn) as the adorable nerds of Team Flash. But the driving force of the series are the writers, who somehow crammed decades worth of Flash comic material into 3 seasons so far with near masterful execution, focusing the theme of what it means to be a hero; the tragedy of it, the choices made and their unintended consequences - all while traveling through time and dimensions.Commenting on other reviewers that gave this show a low score; true, this isn't Breaking Bad, nor is it Game of Thrones. Quite possibly these reviewers are looking for something along the lines of Nolan's Dark Knight which will not work for The Flash. As it stands, The Flash is a great superhero series in it's own right. It is fluffy but it has substance. Thoroughly recommended. And yeah, Supergirl is garbage. ","9"
"The Flash",2017-04-27," Overall I like the series. The biggest element I see is all the characters are complete emotional weaklings. Interaction between Iris and Barry is like 12 yr. Old's in grade school. The physics behind THE FLASH are completely impossible and they make NO effort to make any of it work. I understand this complete fantasy but it would be better with more realistic charters and SOME plausible physics involved. ","8"
"The Flash",2017-04-21," It just doesn't have that special thing that makes something special. Plus it's like everybody is a speedster now. The show could be called The Flashes. When you're saturated with super heros nobody is a super hero. It sorta makes Barry just another character in difficult to watch show. It's not story driven, it's not character driven it's just driven by those of us who read the comic books and enjoy watching our beloved heros come to life which, more often than not, disappoints. ","6"
"The Flash",2017-04-19," i usually get quite bored of super hero TV shows but this is authentic and amazing. the first season is nail biting and the second season is just as good. the characters are good and the acting is excellent. it has witty comedy and the action sequences are impressive unlike some other superhero shows it does not get repetitive and banal it stays and maintains it's content throughout. Watch it ... just watch it ","9"
"The Flash",2017-04-18," I was a big fan of Arrow season 1, and to a slightly lesser extent Arrow season 2. I like super hero movies and series, and can suspend disbelief as long as things make sense in the world it is set in. In The Flash it just doesn't.He can take out 10 bad guys without any of them even realizing he is there. When there are two villains with (bad) gimmick guns, suddenly he has to use a gimmick to defeat them. Why can't he just do to them what he did to the others?The show has a lot of potential, but I just can't suffer through it to see if it will go somewhere. ","1"
"The Flash",2017-04-13," I don't normally write reviews, but after watching most of Flash I just felt compelled to write something. Look, all of these shows are fairly ridiculous and require a certain amount of suspension of disbelief which I'm typically just fine with. Having said that, I do actually find the  Arrow  an entertaining show to watch. After finishing the current available seasons I decided to check out the Flash's stand alone show, despite not being very impressed with the Flash characters when they would cross over into Arrow's world. I tried, I really tried. I consider myself more forgiving than most people when it comes to suspension of disbelief, and I try to watch these shows through a squinted less critical eye. The Flash show though... man, the writing on this show really does need some work. It's unfortunate, because there are some decent scenarios and hints of potential but it almost always gets buried under a mountain of cheese. The tonal consistency is all over the place. The rules of the flash universe seem to be quite flexible or constantly changing. I should also say I am not very taken with the actor that has been chosen to play the flash. He is probably my least favorite character on the show, which is not really a good sign. I find his character development pretty confused, which could be blamed on the writing, but it also feels like the actor playing the flash is equally to blame. I found the character of Barry Allen to grow more and more unlikable, which I don't think was completely intentional. And directly referencing the review title, there are just so many situations and scenes that make you roll your eyes or just down right cringe. There is just situation after situation where the actions taken by the characters, particularly the title character are just so ridiculous and so unrealistic. I realize the show is intended to have a more playful and lighthearted tone than the Arrow, but it also feels like some kind of kids romper room show sometimes in which a bunch of spoiled kids solve every situation by the most dangerous and totally illogical methods. It's difficult to enjoy the show when there is so little logic being employed by the characters. It's difficult for me to sit through an episode of this show without shaking my head or rolling my eyes at it half a dozen times. It's too bad, Flash use to be one of my favorite characters.I really hope that this is not the actor that is playing flash in any of the DC movies... ","4"
"The Flash",2017-04-08," The Flash is a pretty good show. I've also watched Arrow. And I personally prefer The Flash. The plot is good and connected through. Although the explanation about timeline and singularity is not that convincing. But I understand, as the song suggests,  The show must go on . I can totally accept some plausible explanations. I do really like the character Patty Spivot. ( I wish I spelled your name right .) Too bad the playwright decides she should leave. And I looked through the cast list. Based on her position in the cast list, I don't think she will come back. Really like her.Dr. Harrison Wells(Thawne in season 1) is those kinds of love-able evil character. The part where he does the confession of killing Nora Allen kind of makes him less evil and shows that he might actually care about Barry as he helped him get stronger. ","9"
"The Flash",2017-04-02," 2 weeks ago, i read all the negative reviews here and i almost dropped the show. I decided to give it a chance and guess what? It became one of my favourite shows. The only  cheesy  stuff that you can encounter and may bother you are literally in the first 10 minutes of the Pilot episode, but is absolutely understandable, because its predecessor was Arrow. I'm currently on season 2 episode 6 and i just watched finished watching it, and oh my god. I don't want to spoil anything, but if you felt that vibe, in The Dark Knight Rises, where Bane completely destroys Batman, well, that's how dark one of the main villains is in this show. This superhero TV series can grow on you trust me. Give it a shot. You will not regret it. ","10"
"The Flash",2017-03-24," I've only seen the first season so far so I'll comment on it. I'm a fanboy that loves superhero stuff. This series is everything I could want because it captures the spirit of heroism that's so important to any superhero endeavor. If anything Barry is a little too heroic, even apologizing for things that aren't his fault, but that's the kind of spirit the good guys should be about. Though I think he would have been a perfect Peter Parker/Spider-Man, I think Grant Gustin kills it as the Flash. He perfectly captures what it is to be a hero, selflessness (even when it's very painful), compassion and the willingness to risk his life to protect the innocent. That's what heroes are all about and something we've lost in an age where we choose to believe in nothing. Superheroes are all about Utopian ideals; what could we accomplish if we were truly good inside and were motivated by good intentions? We need heroes in our movies and TV and The Flash perfectly captures that. I think Gustin is a terrific young actor because he can express the pain of Barry Allen expertly and that's what's needed for the heroes journey, the choice to serve others at expense of your own goals and dreams. The supporting cast is a bit uneven. Jesse L Martin is excellent and Carlos Valdez gets to be so endearing that certain plot points later on make you upset when things don't go his way. One thing about these CW shows is that the actresses never seen to come off well, just flighty and silly. Danielle Panabaker is fine in her role but Candice Patton's Iris West is a real bubble head. She's the only one the entire first season that can't see the obvious in front or her face. They probably overworked to make her situation with both Barry and Flash as separate entities like Margot Kidder's Lois Lane to Christopher Reeve's Superman. The parallels are virtually identical. Still, if you have to borrow, borrow from something good. Tom Cavanagh is the strongest actor in the series. He handles his complicated part perfectly. The villains are mostly fine though not exactly noteworthy. The exceptions are Reverse Flash (our main villain) and the wonderful Wentworth Miller as old school villain Captain Cold. The special effects are incredible (as they needed to be.) I read a few comments about the show not building a story right away and that's complete nonsense. Barry's creation and evolution as the Flash are juxtaposed with his greatest enemy in his midst without his knowledge (or even knowing he's his enemy yet.) The show builds Harrison Wells as the main villain in Episode 2 so that's pretty much having a direction for the show from early on. And, yes, it's a young Flash so it's going to appeal to younger viewers and that's fine by me. One of the things I loved about the wonderful Batman Begins is that it showed the heroes journey by a young Bruce Wayne into Batman. Heroism comes from the inside and by choice. It's not having superpowers alone. It's what you do with them and The Flash gets that. Hey, I'm a mark for anything superhero but I'm also a mark for good movies and TV. The Flash is a show with millennials in mind and that's fine by me. As an older viewer, I can appreciate it because it captures the timeless beauty of good vs. evil, concepts we should all ponder when we make our choices in life. Loved the first season. Will soon see the second season on DVD and will possibly make another review. ","9"
"The Flash",2017-02-24," The Flash (Grant Gustin) and Cisco (Carlos Valdes) are good actors, but Dr Snow (Danielle Panabarker) is daytime soap opera material. Every time I watch the show and Dr Snows acting is bad it breaks my attention of the plot that it feels unreal. The Flashes Constant inner struggle about his family getting in the way is becoming annoying. He sounds whiny. We get it you don't want anybody to get hurt but you don't have to repeat it every three minutes . ","4"
"The Flash",2017-02-24," The series is badly-written and everyone can't act (except Jesse L. Martin & Tom Cavanagh). They don't show the villains that much they're more focus on Barry Allen and his friends personal lives makes for too much soap opera in this series. There only a couple episodes that were okay/good. Barry is more like Tobey Maguire's Spider-Man. Barry personality was better when he first appear in Arrow, he was more likable. Barry and Iris remind me of Peter Parker and Mary Jane Watson like relationship. Iris and Wally are annoying at times. I prefer Wally West/The Flash II in Justice League animated series better. Wentworth Miller and his partner-in-crime and Mark Hamill are the only ones that make this show work when they guest stars. This series is meant for teens & my age group, prefer to watch Arrow instead. ","6"
"The Flash",2017-02-23," So I am late to the Flash party and am Netflixing the first two seasons right now and just saw Patty Spivot leave. So obviously I looked up if she is coming back and she's not.. that stinks.. She was well, not only attractive, but she was funny and worked well with Barry. With her and Cisco.. the show actually made me laugh out loud during my rides on the commuter trains. Come on.. bring her back! Anyhow, the show is definitely growing on me. Gave it a 9 stars. ","9"
"The Flash",2017-02-22," I can't say much about it, but I think it is a great show!It is sometimes predictable and there are some really stupid choices that The Flash team makes, like changing the time line sometimes without really needing to. In most of the comics,Barry is a really comedic character but in this show he is always serious and thinking about the future and the time line and stuff like that. But for anyone who is going to watch this show, this is not the comic book flash. But I personally, love this show! ","9"
"The Flash",2017-02-21," BEWARE SPOILERS AHEAD i give it a 2 out of 10 because the first season overall story was somewhat appealing, barry training and becoming a hero while dealing with his personal life and how all the other characters fit into it was entertaining.having said this show that's somehow regarded with generally good reviews fails at so many things, the increasingly cheesy writing, the inconsistency with its own established rules which most of the time make no sense anyway like bursting clothes into flames once he stops running(this is why he needed a suit right? well it doesn't seem to be an issue after episode 1 hes constantly seen running with regular clothes and they never catch on fire)the fact that the show treats its audience like morons thinking they can get away with making a guy stop a bullet the moment it touches his skin from being unable to take down most villains who shouldn't even stand their own against him for even 1 tenth of a second the show starts with a flat out lie I AM THE FASTEST MAN ALIVE (EXCEPT WHEN IM NOT...WHICH IS ALL THE TIME)the acting was promising and the clichéd superhero characters were surprisingly entertaining but after season 1 it all seems the same no subtle character development at all, dumb end of the episode out spoken life lessons and the acting is just always the same no real change except for tom cavanagh(obviously) the rest just stay the samethe never ending hopeful hero, the will they wont they routine with the love interest, the nerdy sidekick, the best dad in the world idiocy, the young hot female doctor who's got an answer for everythingat the end of the day this show wont make you remember a great scene, plot, dialogue, dramatic moment or action thrilling sequence...it wont make you laugh nor cry you wont be happy when they finally beat the villain the episode will end and nothing noteworthy will have happened at all, might as well go to the park and feed pigeons ","2"
"The Flash",2017-02-21," It's just really good, that's all there is to it. It's a 'must watch' TV series. If you like watching supernatural films and shows or superhero related content then this is the show for you. The Flash connects with other DC/CW shows such as Arrow, Supergirl and Legends of Tomorrow, I believe some others too, so if you watch this I recommend you watch their other shows to get the full understanding of the story as they connect with each other.10/10. Watch The Flash, Legends of Tomorrow, Supergirl and Arrow, and when you're done after watching over 200 hours worth of fun, you will come back and you will be speechless. It's soo good! ","10"
"The Flash",2017-02-21," Today, I was walking down the street, and I stopped to think  the Reverse Flash should not run on its back ?!  It blew my mind. So here I am commenting on this, because I do not want other people to let themselves be carried away by this farce. Other than that Flash looks like a toy on the rope and runs away. #FORAFLASHREVERSO # REFLITÃO The Zoom dies, the Flash Reverse dies, Flash rapes the time line, the father of the Flash mine dies, the Flash is faster than lightning and the Kid Flash appears, they bet a race, Kid Flash lose. At the end of the first season Flash discovers that Reverse Flash is actually your teacher. #FORAFLASHREVERSO #REFLITÃO F*CK REVERSE FLASH BITCH*S ","1"
"The Flash",2017-02-21," I love this show! Its very creative, with characters that actually make wise and morally right decisions. Full of the beauty of depth of heart. I love a good storyline (which this show has), but just as importantly if not more so, I have to fall in love with the characters! I feel a genuine love and connection to all of the characters in The Flash. :) To everyone connected to the making of this show, hugs! Keep it coming! :) ","10"
"The Flash",2017-02-19," I watched the first couple seasons of The Arrow but by the third season - yeesh. The entire cast was about 15 years old and silly beyond belief. The Flash follows the same superhero formula and the boredom of it sets in immediately. The mysterious mentor. The tough disbelieving cop. The BFF who knows nothing but will be shocked, tearful, angry by the inevitable truth. The love interest who is perpetually crabby. The nerdy sidekick. The one-armed man subplot about the death of a loved one. Superhero abilities and bad guys - interchangeable with anything on TV today. What annoys me the most, though, is the 20-something  doctor.  Hollywood loves the young hot girl playing doctor. Twelve years of higher education, internship, residency and then presumably a bunch of years of experience - all by the age of 26. ","1"
"The Flash",2017-02-13," Overall it's a soap in comic hero clothes. The family drama, the continue resetting of the relationships due to manipulation of the timeline, the boring love story with Iris... I mean it's exhausting. Last drop was the mystical episode of Barry meeting the speed force or its representative. Now the speed force is god? FFS. Besides shouldn't the Flash be a funny character? Because this Barry is quite boring. He isn't even a hero despite how many times it gets repeated in the show. He spends his time putting patches to the disasters he himself provokes because of unresolved mum issues. And with all those scientists who can do things  more advanced than CERN  nobody explains him not to do it. I give it 5 because I like Harrison Wells character - pity he's not much in season 3 - and the visual effects are pretty good. ","5"
"The Flash",2017-02-07," I started watching this show while recovering from an accident. I couldn't walk for weeks and watching the Flash run gave me life. I was hooked. Season 1 of the series is probably the best. If you've just started watching, my advice is to cherish those moments with your favorite characters because the writers of this show do not understand character development. We're into season 3, and everyone is a shadow of the person they used to be. Dr. Caitlin Snow's character had made the most progress until tonight's episode - 3x12 - where these people erased everything they had done to make her one of the best parts of this show. I am sick of Barry and Caitlin's character regressions with each passing week. The former is always depressed. The latter is always in doubt of herself. These are not the characters I fell in love with. This is not the show I fell in love with. If you think it's easy for me to write this, you're wrong. I am devastated. The Flash is my favorite show. I'm writing this in the hope that SOMEONE from the show somehow reads it. I need them to realize the wasted potential here. I need them to know that this show helped through a very difficult period in my life. I need them to stop ruining the Flash. ","1"
"The Flash",2017-01-31," I've been meaning to check out The Flash for a long time and lamented that it has never made its way to free to air television in Australia. It's been everywhere else but I've had the misfortune to miss out. Finally in December last year I was able to get my hands on Season 1 on Blu-Ray and right from the very first episode, I'd found myself a winner. Every episode was enjoyable to start to finish and I was thrilled to see Grant Gustin perfectly fit into the red suit as The Flash.Central City Forensic Police Investigator Barry Allen (Grant Gustin) finds himself blessed with the power of running at super speed following a freak accident which sees him struck by lightening following a massive particle accelerator accident which affected most of Central City and its citizens. Some citizens were blessed/cursed with unusual metahuman powers, and others were killed or seriously injured. Adopting his alternate identity as The Flash, he is taken under the wing of a group of scientists at S.T.A.R Labs led by the Dr Harrison Wells (Tom Cavanagh) and fellow scientists Cisco Ramon (Carlos Valdes) and Caitlin Snow (Danielle Panabaker). Barry Allen must keep his new found metahuman powers a secret from Detective Joe West (Jesse L. Martin) and Barry's childhood friend Iris West (Candice Patton) who took Barry in as a young age after his father Henry Allen (John Wesley Shipp) was falsely imprisoned after the murder of Barry's mother Nora Allen (Michelle Harrison) 14 years ago.Grant Gustin nails it perfectly as Barry Allen/The Flash. Breathing life into the famed comic book character, the TV series has brought upon a new legion of fans who have barely sighted The Flash apart from the various comic books, cartoons, and the short lived TV series in the early 1990's where John Wesley Shipp donned the iconic red tights.The best thing about The Flash is that is highly entertaining and lets the audiences sit back and enjoy the fun. Kids and adults alike can get in on the fun as well. I've found a greater appreciation of The Flash and I'm looking forward to see the movie when it hits cinemas in 2018 and this time Ezra Miller will don the famed red tights.I've been looking forward to watching The Flash and without having high expectations, it was definitely well worth it. The Flash has been a long overdue (and well deserved) addition to the list of TV series that I enjoy watching.9/10. ","9"
"The Flash",2017-01-20," If you love superhero shows and movies then  The Flash  is a show for you! Brings so much from the comics into the show and if you are a comic book nerd or just a superhero nerd in general it will make you feel all warm inside. They bring so much more then just the flash, other hero's have joined this series as well such as Firestorm, Vibe, Jay Garrick and more! Everyone that I have ever talked to about the show have all thought it was great, I mean I even got my grandma to watch it and she still loves it till this day. Once or twice a year they also team up with  The Arrow  cast and have cross over episodes which are great to see. Two shows colliding is always fun to watch. So if you are interested in this give it a shot you wont regret it. ","10"
"The Flash",2017-01-08," Grant Gustin played the flash very well supported by very good cast like Tom Cavanagh as Harrison Wells, Jesse Martin as Joe, Tom Felton as Julian in season 3 etc. John Wesley Shipp who played flash in TV series(of 1990) is cast as Barry's father and also as first flash which is nostalgic for CBS series fans.(he played Barry Allen in CBS's flash)flash really worth watching, both seasons had twists and turns especially first season was bang on! Tom Cavanagh played Harrison wells greatly but at first his H. R.(Earth-19) was awful. Recommended to watch full season before negative comments!!! (some minor inconsistencies one can't ignore are inability to avoid punches from slow villains like Tony Woodward while beating fastest opponents)Enjoy And keep running. Cheers!!! ","10"
"The Flash",2017-01-01," If you had asked me a couple of years ago what the best super hero TV show at the time was, I would have said The Flash.The show started excellently well with a gripping pilot and a good story line. It starts with how Barry Allen becomes The Flash starting with how he gets his powers, then learns how to use/control them and then tries to solve the mystery of his mother's death to avenge his father. Overall season 1 was superb! Season 2 was weak when it comes to the story line but the excitement of seeing new metas, cross over episodes and 'team flash' developing some individual abilities of their own makes watching the season worthwhile.Season 3 has been average at best and my rating of flash that started from a full 10 has dropped to 7 over two years. Constant time traveling and meddling with things not only gets confusing in my opinion, but also makes you lose interest.I would definitely recommend people to give this show a go (especially if you are a DC fan) but the eventual and constant decline of the show is pretty obvious as you go on with the episodes.

"The Flash",2016-12-17," Why does everybody like this show? Arrow is the best. This show is repetitive. five reasons I don't like it: 1. The acting is bad. 2. The Villains are bad. 3. The characters never change. 4. The character development is bad. 5. It's just boring. Out of all of the CW DC shows it's the worst. Here is the list of CW DC shows from best to worst: 1. Arrow 2. Supergirl 3. DC's Legends of Tomorrow 4. The Flash. Am i the only one who thinks this show is horrible? Don't watch it! Listen to me! Please it is so bad it is bad for your health. I'm serious! Just don't watch it. No matter what your friends say. Don't watch it. Please don't. no matter what. Don't. I hope I helped you make a good choice. :) ","1"
"The Flash",2016-12-10," One of the best shows out there. I'm gonna fight 'em off A seven nation army couldn't hold me back They're gonna rip it off Taking their time right behind my back And I'm talking' to myself at night Because I can't forget Back and forth through my mind Behind a cigaretteAnd the message comin' from my eyes says,  Leave it alone. Don't wanna hear about it Every single one's got a story to tell Everyone knows about it From the Queen of England to the hounds of hell And if I catch it comin' back my way I'm gonna serve it to you And that ain't what you want to hear But that's what I'll doAnd the feeling coming from my bones says,  Find a home. I'm going to Wichita Far from this opera for evermore I'm gonna work the straw Make the sweat drip out of every pore And I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding, and I'm bleeding Right before the lord All the words are gonna bleed from me And I will think no more ","10"
"The Flash",2016-12-02,"  He who runs fast will always be ahead of the slow, at least in terms of the distance they have travelled in a race. This show makes me feel great about life in general. It is in actuality an accurate depiction of my life. My entire childhood I have been fat but then one day after watching this show I got the motivation to run like my pants were on fire. Since then I have never stopped running and better than that I have fallen in love; both with this show and it's lead. This is the kind of show you want to watch if you want to learn something in life. The best thing about the show is the lighting. I like that it is mostly day time in the show and that we are able to see the faces of the people of the planet so clearly. It gives me much joy to be doing this. Another good aspect of the show is the way it coalesces fantasy and science and creates this cool new world with colour and fantasy and goodness. More shows should strive to be like this phenomenal work of cinema. My only request from the makers of the show is that they cancel the show. ","1"
"The Flash",2016-12-01,"  The Flash  is a well developed show all around. This show, unlike other superhero shows, didn't take a couple episodes to get really interesting. The cast is a very talented group of people. It seems the acting is better when the cast is more friendly with each other behind the characters and that's what made this show better.  The Flash  is full of action throughout the whole series as well as drama and comedy. The producer knew when to make the show funny and it was at the perfect moments too.When watching this TV show, I seemed to never get bored and each episode it got more and more interesting. Personally, I don't think this show needs anything else to become a better show. I don't think it could become more intriguing. I've never watched any superhero shows so this is my first one watching, and it makes me want to watch other superhero shows.  The Flash  just didn't bring excitement, it showed that Barry Allen isn't just known as  The Flash . He is also a detective, while he works to get his Dad out of prison for a crime he didn't commit. The effects in this show are outstanding. I can't really say I didn't like anything about this show but I know the cliffhangers can be annoying. The most neat part to me is how they didn't cram too much information in the first couple episodes. It is hard for people to get lost throughout the season. As well as having crossovers from other superhero TV shows makes the show more fascinating. This superhero show  The Flash  is all around an outstanding TV series. I couldn't possibly be more intrigued. It brings standalone episodes introducing new villains through tiers of episodes. As well as all of the characters personal relationships. Bringing superpowers, science, and a psychic gorilla. It's more action-packed than other DC comic TV series out there.  The Flash  showing that it may not all be about superpowers to be a hero! ","8"
"The Flash",2016-11-29," I enjoy this show as a spin off from The Arrow. I find the characters fun, for the most part, and Barry Allen engaging and believable - I like his sense of humor. I was so excited to see Tom Cavannah - he has been a favorite of mine for a long time and he doesn't disappoint. I do wish the writers of the two shows would try to make the main female characters less annoying. They constantly put the heroes and their loved ones in danger because they refuse to listen. They don't get what they want and whine about it. I find them selfish and frequently grating. The women in The Arrow and The Flash are interchangeable which is an indication of lazy writing in my mind. I do like Felicity though at least in the early seasons. The Flash doesn't rely so heavily on flash backs which I appreciate. I don't watch this expecting intellectually stimulating dialog - and I don't get it but it is good escapism. My only request and this is what had me get tired of The Arrow and while it is a little thing - for the love of all that is holy - stop asking  are you OK . All the time they are doing this. If you are trying to make the show a drinking game, your audience would be wasted half way through. Stop it! It isn't quite as bad as The Arrow for this annoying little tic, but annoying enough. All that being said, if you want escapism and predictability The Flash is worth a visit. ","7"
"The Flash",2016-11-17," I love Marvel and DC, no doubt if they come up with a B-grade show I will watch that too. Flash is good, at least in the beginning it was so good. But as the story is escalating to new seasons here the content is decreasing. A Superhero cannot be so dumb to create all problems by himself and fight them later involving the life of the city peoples. Grant Gustin is so cute that sometime he overcomes his acting skills with this cuteness. The story has become so obvious that you don't need any spoiler for this show anymore. You know if everything becomes okay then he will again do a mistake and bring up all those villains from somewhere. And the STAR LABS, they are out of the universe man. They can even make a black hole in their lab and even with in few hours, come-on everything about star labs are exaggerated. My full 10 for just the brand flash but for the content I give 6. I hope they will come up with better content. ","7"
"The Flash",2016-11-10," The flash is a TV show about a normal guy who turns into a superhero. This show mixes humor and serious scenes really well. I love this show because of its acting, special effects, and humor. Grant Gustin does a memorable job as Barry Allen and the flash. It's a show that when you first watch it it takes some time getting us to but in the end everybody loves. IT is good for any age. No matter if you don't like superheros it is still a good show to watch. If you love sci-fi and fantasy you will love this show. The cast work well together and couldn't have been better for their parts. It's a fun loving show that is fun for the whole family. ","10"
"The Flash",2016-11-05," While The Flash isn't truly awful, it's certainly not up there with the good TV programmes.The opening credits of Season 2 has Barry Allen/The Flash talking about the rift HE created through his own selfish motives, which allowed dangerous meta-humans to invade our world. He then congratulates himself by telling us that only HE is fast enough to stop them!! Heroic? More like a spoilt brat in need of a serious slap!! Anyone brought up watching Sci-Fi will understand that when time travelling, changing the past also changes the present. Our 'Super Hero' hasn't quite figured this one out for himself yet. He travels back in time on a few occasions, once again, for his own selfish reasons, only to be shocked to find he's done something to detrimentally alter his own time. OK, doing it once is stupid, but you can sort of make allowances because he's just a kid with a new super-power and he gets carried away with his own importance. After 3 such acts of stupidity, you really have to start wondering just how 'heroic' he actually is!! It's like watching a zombie constantly walking into a locked, glass door. The fact that Barry Allen is so self obsessed, so doesn't learn from his mistakes, just gets boring after a while... especially when he gets all depressed about the effect his actions of having on him, as if the world is working against him! Overall, a silly, spoilt, whiny character. ","4"
"The Flash",2016-11-03," I see a lot of bad comments about this show and I have to say that I don't agree. I really like this show and enjoy watching each episode of it. I think that they're always episodes in a series that are better than the others but it doesn't mean it's a bad series. Of course you have to like the super hero style in general and everybody has different tastes. I'm not saying you should all have the same opinion as me but I think it's worth trying and watching regularly. The characters are great and I even like the bad guys on this show and that's not in my habits. This show made my laugh and cry. When I really appreciate a show, I can exaggerate so sorry if I all bored you but I found that there should also be a positive comment on this terrific show! ","9"
"The Flash",2016-11-02," I have been a big fan of  The flash  since i began watching the show. The first 2 seasons were too interesting, but this season has its flaws. I feel its just the story building that they are onto, still i expect the show to keep me hooked up which is not the case in recent episodes. It will be better if the screenplay improves in upcoming episodes. There must be a change in the way the episodes are built or else i don't see the show lasting for long except for kids. Mostly, here in India college students make majority of viewers, so it's going to be difficult to keep the viewership if the plot strays away from what it should be. ","7"
"The Flash",2016-11-01," The Flash benefits from its purposefully light atmosphere, making it a superhero show uniquely geared toward genre fans as well as novices. With distinctive visuals and a terrific cast, The Flash remains one of the strongest comic book shows on television, all while remaining action-packed, funny, and dramatic. There is light amid the darkness, The Flash sports a great cast, visually well-designed sets and effects, and the pace and atmosphere reflect the deft hands of directors and crew. Not every superhero program has to be a somber affair and this light-hearted and wonderfully upbeat program proves that week after week. It remains a show about a superhuman that's just as concerned with the  human  as it is with the  super  and the end result is charming.... ","10"
"The Flash",2016-10-26," I'm sorry but a  genetic analysis  on an  digital file proved the file was genuine !? What does genetic has to with digital files!? The flash his speed causes clothing to burn a shirt of an hot woman he rescued, forcing the flash to tear of the shirt of said (good looking) woman. In every other episode where the Flash rescues people their clothes DON'T catch on fire. I guess that the laws of physics only set your clothes on fire if you're good looking... and that's just some examples of the bad writing. The Flash COULD have been a very good series, if only if the writers would have been a little more grounded in reality. Too bad they are not. Bet let's be honest, if you are an writer for the script of The Flash, with no (real) understanding of physics AND having a habit of ignoring what kind of solutions you wrote to a problem in the last episode and decide to change it anyway, what kind of writer are you then? And (even worse) this is probably why you won't see the Grant Gustin (the actor playing the Flash in the series) playing the Flash in the movies like Superman vs Batman and other yet to come. ","2"
"The Flash",2016-10-24," It was hard for me to come up with a sensible review, as there were many things that I enjoyed about this series, but some aspects made me more than irritated when watching. The strong points of Flash are that the show is rather chipper, with lovely Gustin Grant in the lead as Barry Allen aka the Flash. Grant plays well as the nerdy, but cute hero of Central City, who is supported by a small team of experts (nerds) of probably everything science. The team and other main characters have their moments but most of the time, the dialogue is a bit too forced and the acting dull. Especially the mandatory love interest Iris West is the living cliché of a superhero girlfriend, who tends to be both boring and annoying, and it doesn't make it any better that Candice Patton seems to be a woman with only one facial expression. Some character flaws however are mostly due to the bad and sloppy script writing that plagues the show from time to time. Some of the highlights showcasing this aspect include, but are not limited to the following: 1) A big city of millions of people happens to have only two detectives, who solve all the crimes (especially all related to the new emerging metahumans). 2) The 20 somethings run the STAR lab all day everyday, without any other priorities in life. 3) Two super criminals have blasters that could freeze/burn all the cops, but they only aim for their shields and not their legs, which are visible. And flash doesn't grab their guns even though he could with his quick feet as other people have pointed out (continuity?). 4) One of the most laughable moments was episode 14, where the cosy twosome of Ronnie/Stein merged in Ronnie's body, explodes, but somehow they both survive and have separated into two different bodies? Their clothes are a little burned, but honestly, if Ronnie didn't turn into a 3D printer during the explosion, where on Earth did Stein's body magically appear from (with glasses and all)? The show has similar kind of goofs, but this was just plain stupid.Still, even though the intelligence of the viewer is sometimes underestimated with the aforementioned things, the show is still entertaining if you let things slide. Why, it's hard to tell. Somehow I find humor in the crappy script writing and the poor written characters. Flash itself is an interesting character and I like the cross references they have with the Arrow for instance. And as a lover of the whole superhero genre itself, I can see why this series is getting a strong liking from the fan base as all in all, it's well-intentioned even with all its faults. In conclusion I kind of hate to love this show, but still it's fun to love hating it too. ","5"
"The Flash",2016-10-23," I have never written a review before but the quality of this show compelled me to warn others. Everything wrong with this show has been stated multiple times by other negative reviews and it's all true. The actors, the acting, the scripts, the consistency... all of it is either bad, terrible or non existent. They recycle characters constantly. Nothing the flash ever faces is really a challenge. Watching this show is like you are stuck in a pool of urine up to your neck then somebody comes in with a bucket full of feces to dump on your head. Do you duck down under the urine or do you stay up and take on the feces? They could have done so much more with this show. It has such awesome potential. I actually have no idea how they made it so poorly. I would love to ask the writing team. If you watch it for more than the first season you will come to the same conclusion. Anyone who is rating this show highly should come clean and admit they have not watched more than a few episodes or admit that they are so jaded by superhero shows and movies they can't resist but leave high ratings. Wait for the remake in 10 years. It could not possibly be any worse. ","1"
"The Flash",2016-10-21," -- SPOILER ALERT -- If you like drama, self guilt, meaningless situations, contradictory events, no-sense time traveling and really poor developed and depressed characters, this is your show. I am writing this review from a script and cinematography and not a fanatic point of view. With that said, I've been watching this show since season 1, sometimes fast-forwarding episodes to make easier for my brain to digest the slow, cheesy, dramatic and pointless pace of the episodes and the show in general. I just watch it to learn what not to do with an incredible superhero if I ever write a script sometime in my life. This show is a tutorial of  How to  destroy a character so much to the point of boredom. The cycle and sad events mixed with a whole bunch of other  speedsters  makes the main (and supposedly unique) character and hero of the show look like one more, but a really confused, lost and weak one, most of the time. Shame. The dialogues are terrible, the acts are awfully directed and the character development is embarrassing at some points. The story plot is so weak, that makes you question almost every decision taken by the Team Flash and lifeless supporting characters. The weekly evil meta human kids or crazy folks make the show predictable since the first minute of every single episode, and then maybe just waiting for an old character to appear surprisingly with probably other powers, that will become problematic so you'll have to watch 30 minutes of depressing dialogues between confused characters trying to fix a pointless problem that will be faded away into the room of darkness and forgotten stories of the show, all of this to make room to another pointless story next week, that will confuse you as much as the characters look.Seriously, really bad and addictive for that reason. Take two ! 1/21 in my Top of no-sense. ","2"
"The Flash",2016-06-18,"  My name is Barry Allen and I am the fastest man alive . That introduction speaks for itself, doesn't it? I'm not going to lie; I was a bit sceptical about this show. I wasn't sure what I was getting myself into and I wasn't even sure I was even going to like it. But I am so glad I have been proved wrong. The spin-off to 'Arrow', 'The Flash' is a league of its own and is fast becoming a force to be reckoned with.When Barry Allen (Grant Gustin) was young, he witnesses his mother's death and his father (John Wesley Shipp) is wrongfully accused for it. Consequently, he is hell-bent on finding out who the real culprit is. Fast-forward fourteen years, he is now a police forensic investigator working alongside his adoptive father Joe West (Jesse L. Martin). He gets struck by lightening caused by the particle accelerator created by S.T.A.R Labs and goes into a nine-month coma. When he wakes up, he discovers he has super human speed and becomes... The Flash.Well Mr Berlanti, you have done it again. Taking a step back from the brooding Star(ling) City in 'Arrow', we move to a more relaxed Central City. But even so, it doesn't mean everything is all sunshine and flowers. Gustin's performance of Barry is amazing. You sympathise with him and all you want to do is give him a hug. During the show, you definitely see him take on more responsibility as 'The Flash', but at the end of the day... he's still your socially awkward forensic scientist. The comedic moments are filled with Cisco Ramon (Carlos Valdes). His ability to break any tension with movie references or any other comment is brilliant and you can't help but laugh. Tom Cavanagh as Harrison Wells is great and you can never tell whether he's on the good side... or the bad. Jesse L. Martin's portrayal as Joe is great, he's like your big old Papa Bear. Protective of his daughter and a great father-figure to Barry, you will wish that you had a dad like him. Not forgetting the ladies of the show, Danielle Panabaker as Caitlyn Snow and Candice Patton as Iris West are so good and terrific examples of your modern-day women. Both strong and independent, they are perfect role models for younger girls who could watch the show.It's only two seasons in, but I definitely recommend this show to anyone because, well, it has everything. Drama, comedy and with even a little romance thrown in. This show is for everyone and for every comic book fan out there. So, for anyone who hasn't started binge watching it... what are you waiting for?! I, for one, can't wait for season three! ","10"
"The Flash",2016-06-17," I have been quite happy with the Flash until I saw season 2 Episode 18. The writing in that episode is beyond stupidity. Why?- All portals to the other earth were closed. Zoom is fatally sick. In a few years he would die by himself. No real reason to open portal to other earth.- Barry is faster than Zoom. Barry captures Zoom but does not knock him out or anything. Instead Barry just talks to Zoom and fails to keep him captured. Also the trap they made for Zoom is stupid. Barry already is faster than Zoom so there was no need for a trap.- When Zoom handed over Wally to the Flash team, why didn't Barry just break the deal and kill him or at least knock him out and capture him?. Instead Barry makes the most retarded decision he has ever made. He gives his powers to the serial killer Zoom, who could kill everyone in the earth especially when there is no one to stop him (the Flash is the only one who could stop him).So Barry risks both earths for no good reason. Was he afraid to fight Zoom? Who knows. I hope they don't make this kind of writing mistakes in the future or the Flash is over for me. ","1"
"The Flash",2016-06-16," I was a little bit hesitant about this in the beginning. The Flash has always been in my Top 3 DC characters and I wasn't entirely convinced that The CW could do it justice.Boy was I wrong!This, for over half of the season, has been my favourite new show of the 2014/15 season.Every episode from the beginning just got better and better and would always leave me wanting the next week to hurry up and get here.The cast is amazing. The three that I always enjoy watching is Grant Gustin, Danielle Panabaker and Carlos Valdes; they are all good to watch on their own but when the three of them work together is always awesome to watch.The relationships are another thing I love about this show, most notably between Barry and Joe; the friendship between the two and also the father/son moments, especially in the final episode. Another one would have to be Wells and Cisco in particular towards the end of the season, I actually believe that Wells genuinely liked Cisco and regrets the way things had to go.The range of guest stars and characters throughout the season, including the cast from Arrow, were awesome but Robbie Amell and Victor Garber as Firestorm were the highlight for me.Another highlight and probably my favourite moments of the whole show; GRODD! Who would think that any show could bring in a telepathic gorilla into a show and not make it look like a joke. I really hope we see a lot more of Grood in Season 2!My least favourite character would have to be Iris. Just really didn't get into watching the character on the screen but the moment when I disliked her the most was, I think it was episode 21 or 22, when Barry told her Wells killed his mother and her reaction was all about Eddie. I get it, your boyfriend has been kidnapped but your best friend has finally found out who murdered his mother and all she could concentrate on was her boyfriend and Barry's lies.I love all the DC Comics references throughout the season from Ferris Air, Coast City and Jay Garrick but the awesome thing about these easter eggs is that they don't paint a neon sign towards it saying 'Look here!', it just there for those who know their stuff.I am EAGERLY looking forward to Season Two! For me, it's too long to wait!If you're not watching this <U+0096> GET ON IT!************************ SEASON TWO *******************************I absolutely loved the first season so I was eagerly waiting for the new season. While Season Two is awesome, there are starting to be things in the show that I do not like.Like Barry Allen! Barry had to be the worst character of the whole season, just so much complaining, whining, whinging and pig headedness. Always running off half-cocked, not listening to the team, screws up and then goes running back to them for help.I really hope Barry improves in Season Three because there were some points throughout the season that he was hard to watch.Cisco on the other hand; G.O.L.D! By far the best thing about the show and his character got bigger and better this season, still managing to stay the same character and so much more with the addition of his powers. Always on hand to make light of a dark situation without diminishing the importance of the situation.I really hope Season Three brings a bigger and better storyline for Caitlin rather than her being in love and ultimately getting hurt. Having said that, I did absolutely love seeing Killer Frost <U+0096> no matter how short it was.The relationship between Barry and Joe is still as amazingly awesome as it was in Season One, just so heartfelt and pure. I originally was unconvinced of the idea of bringing back Tom Cavanagh full time but that changed throughout the season and worked really well without rehashing anything from the previous season.This season I found Iris and Wally pretty useless, if they weren't in the show; as far as I'm concerned they wouldn't be missed. I felt that they brought Wally in too early to then just have him floating around in the background, he did get a bit more of a story towards the end of the season but that's when they should have brought him in.Now onto Zoom. Overall, I have to say I'm pretty disappointed and that has nothing to do with the acting. Teddy Sears was brilliant but I think the writing and the structure of the season let it down.I started to get sick of the here and there appearances; in one episode and gone for two. Repeat. In my opinion, I don't think we should have seen Zoom until the last episode before mid-season break or the returning episode afterwards. They should have spent the first half with miscellaneous bad guys from Earth 2 with inklings of Zoom, making him more of a menacing figure and then had his story more compacted through the second half of the show.I still love this show, due to awesome dynamic between the cast, I think it's the best of the DCTV universe so I will 100% be watching Season Three.

"The Flash",2016-06-12," Well I started to watch this show last year,and I was pretty much hooked to it.First of all i had been following the comics of flash{HE is my Favorite} so I had a doubt if any TV show can match that standard{of the comics}so I didn't watched it at first but after the season 1 ended a friend of mine insisted me to watch it so I decided to give it a shot.Honestly,It was totally worth it.The Flash is a Lighthearted show which combines humor and action perfectly,with a decent cast and some best VFX out there in television,All I can say is it is the best superhero show out there in the world!!!!!PROS Amazing castVFX!!!Story linesThe villains{Reverse Flash and Zoom}CiscoGrant's portrayal of Barry AllenTom Cavanagh Combines Darkness and Humor perfectlyCONS Weak acting by Danielle Panabaker in some of the episodesOverall rating:10/10 ","10"
"The Flash",2016-06-10," Let's the good stuff out of the way: Pretty everything about season 1 was great (after a slow start, I'll admit) but the show took a sickening nosedive right off the bat in season 2.What on earth happened?!? Your guess is as good as mine.The scenes were more and more like something out of a badly written soap opera and, somehow, the cast's acting became tackier as well.The show has replaced an interesting and captivating story with great plot twists with a god-awful, amateurish crap-fest full of cringe- worthy moments.I am so disappointed, it saddens me... ","5"
"The Flash",2016-06-07," I enjoy this show more than other CW shows especially in Arrowverse. In season 2 finale, they did twist  barry went back in time to save his mother , which made all things the achievements he did pretty much useless. He could have started his own family; even though, he lost his parents. He selfish to do that didn't even think about what it will do to others. No one else had no say in it, he is pretty much controlling the situation. With that been said, season 3 will most likely cover the Flashpoint storyline, which I am looking forward to. Between this show and legends of tomorrow, they need to follow strict timeline rules, instead, they are bending rules for each show. News flash, the custom rule per shows is ruining both shows (pick one and follow it). If you went back in time and change small things, it won't effect much, but changing big things, it should have more effect. The world does not revolve around one city (especially changing something small in one city affect the entire world, just NO). ","9"
"The Flash",2016-05-25," In my opinion, this show started great with a surprising first season, but as the second season came along is like the show- runners and script writers ran out of ideas and started doing random stuff that made no sense whatsoever. The second season had way too many plot holes and continuity errors. Too many things made no sense whatsoever and many other things were left completely unexplained. It was almost as if the both the show- runners and the script writers were changed halfway through the season and they had no idea what was going on with the show. I won't get too much into detail but an example of this was the Zoom almost killing  Jay Garrick  flashback at the beginning of the season. Technically, with what happened later on the show, that NEVER happened since it was all made up by zoom, so why show a flashback to an event that never happened?! A second example was when Zoom killed his Jay Garrick self in front of the team. He arrived with the body at his lair and said  Well, this is a complication  but then like 3 episodes later supposedly it was all part of his plan all along and his Jay Garrick self agreed to being killed. So why, if it was all part of his plan all along and his other self agreed to being killed, why was it a complication? The season already ended and this was never explained. These two things I just mentioned were left completely unexplained and it caused continuity errors with things that happened later that SAME season. They create quite the plot holes as well. But these are just two of perhaps the 10 to 15 things that were left completely unexplained by that season. It is almost as if they just rushed through the script writing without revising it after they were done. They really didn't think things through with this season. Maybe the success of the first season got in their heads and they thought they could just make a bunch of random illogical stuff and people would like it.Another thing is that the acting this season felt less natural, like they suddenly forgot how to act sometimes. It bugged me quite a lot, specially with Danielle Panabaker who, in my opinion, had the worst acting this season.This does not applies to Tom Cavanagh because he is actually a great actor.So yeah, unfortunately, looking at how the second season played out, if in the third season they don't do something to fix all the errors they made in the second season then this show will get nowhere, and if they continue making more continuity errors and plot holes then this show will completely fail.

"The Flash",2016-05-25," Wow!! Where do I start about this show. It is truly one of the best shows on TV right now and hands down the best show of the superhero genre. The first 6-7 episodes were a bit slow and honestly they put me off from the show for a bit but boy did it become amazing once that first 'Arrow' crossover rolled around. This show got me interested into the DC universe and now my friends say that I can write a doctoral thesis on DC. Such is the brilliance of this show. The best thing of this show according to me is that it appeals to all audiences and isn't limited to only those people who have read comics. It splendidly establishes the origin story for Barry Allen and explains each detail extremely well. This show shouldn't be looked at as a superhero show but as a Crime show which happens to have superheroes and super-villains in it. The plot twists on this show are to die for. They are such that they can rival those of Game of thrones, arguably the master of the plot twist.The special effects of this show are also extremely well done and each VFX sequence seems fluid and not at all clunky. This is very commendable considering that this show runs on a TV budget which is significantly lesser than the budget for a movie. This show is must watch for comic book fans and is well worth a try for regular TV watchers. It has got the full potential to be the best show on TV within the next few years. ","10"
"The Flash",2016-05-24," When I first saw the previews of The Flash, I was convinced this show would be terrible because it felt cheesy. The main actor, Grant Gustin, was relatively unknown and so was most of the cast. I didn't watch the show at first until the Arrow Flash crossover episode was about to air which forced me to watch this show. I am so glad I took a chance on this show. First and foremost, Grant Gustin is one of the best castings for a superhero that I have seen- up there with the casting of Chris Evans as Captain America, Christian Bale as Batman, and Ryan Reynolds as Deadpool. Second, the supporting cast are perfect. Love Cisco almost as much as Barry. The first season was so good, I was counting the days to season 2. This season has been great as well. And you know what makes this show so great? The writing and actors. No filler episodes. Each episode has independently been great. The season 2 finale is tonight and quite honestly, just like last year, I am excited. Go Flash and keep up the great work. ","10"
"The Flash",2016-05-21," Bad writing.Bad acting.Some fans of Smallville might kinda like it.But I find that even hard to believe.This is a very rotten version of it.Young kids might like it.. I don't know.. 6 or 7 year olds? But if I was 7 again.. nevermind.. I wouldn't like this.Not really much else to say, it is a typical superhero show on CW. Poor effort throughout.A bit of a shame, Flash was pretty cool in the JLA cartoons. Yeah go watch a JLA/Flash cartoon. Way better. ","1"
"The Flash",2016-05-19," Sry for my English - i am from Germany!I'm still watching this sh..t, just because i like the flash and there are some good animations where he moves fast. I don't have anything against the actors -still they upset me sometimes with the artificial drama. The most annoying is the story - the logical things. They try to force so much science into the episodes but they violate the basic laws of physics at the same time.For example: Why must flash punch the giant gorilla with his hand??? Pick a f...g steel bar, speed up to mach-8 and punch the gorilla with the steel bar - that would be clever! Punching the gorilla with the hand on mach-8 is just stupid and you risk damage to the hand, nobody would do that - and you can apply this example to every episode!Then there is  Mr. Cold  or whatever he is called. He is not even a real enemy to the flash. He cant do sh..t against flash with his canon. And why does flash have to run into the ice-cannon and fire-cannon at the same time to defeat the villains? Again do the same trick with the steel bar (like with the gorilla) and there would never be a problem.There is something the writers and directors need to understand: The flash is so fast that it is difficult to find a real enemy for him. Still this is the challenge - to find a villain who beats flash with speed or with his cleverness - the reversed flash was a nice try (with his dead again not being logical).No creativity, no logic - just stupid scripts.

"The Flash",2016-05-18," I really like this show First of all because I LOVE superheroes, second, because it isn't overly violent and not creepy. I enjoy being able not to watch a dark film. Some people are saying it is a little cliché, but I am kind of liking that. It makes you feel good at the end of an episode when some things get wrapped up. This isn't necessarily a show for younger kids, but it is good for a slightly more mature audience.***(small spoiler) The Flash grower stronger mentally and physically each show and he is a good role model of a kid trying to figure out his life. ","8"
"The Flash",2016-05-15," In my opinion the show is a good portrayal of the flash, and that's what the show is about.It is addressed to a viewer group from 6 years onward so the show contains a naive plot, naive logic. The budget is pretty low, so the action scenes and special effects are not on top level, but satisfying. The Cast is very small but as the story progresses one start to love them. As far as i am concerned it is better than supergirl, arrow or other dc series. So the series makes great sense on its own way. So watch it if you are able rest your brain for 50 minutes, enjoy without awake the scientist in you and endure some e not so compelling scenes. PS.It is nearly impossible to write a story(that lasts more than one episode) of the flash( who) without denying the laws of physics, logic and common sense. It is also very very hard to make a villain or antagonist every episode that is as powerful as the flash, because what is as powerful as the fastest man alive besides more faster enemies like reverse flash, zoom(they are already in it, but it would be boring if they were the only villains) or major dc villains like darkside etc.So don't put your expectations to high while watching this show.

"The Flash",2016-05-14," I try not to include much of my opinions in reviews because I might share a different viewpoint than my reader; however, this show shall be my only exception (until I get hooked on another show). So let's begin: I am an avid comic book fan, meaning that I know all things comic. I also reserve the fact that some people just don't like comics but if you stick with me I promise you that you will have a whole different viewpoint on this show.When this first show came out most of the cast was pretty much unknown except for Grant Gustin who was a known star on the hit show  Glee . The stars of the show did gain decent fame after the premiere but when the show started gaining momentum the stars were catapulted to fame city. The main stars are Grant Gustin, Candice Patton, Danielle Panabaker, and Carlos Valdes. Every single actor and actress on this show is so talented and so well formulated and the characters in the show cannot be played by better actors. One thing is for sure, these actors definitely earned their stardom. Barry Allen wakes up 9 months after he was struck by lightning and discovers that the bolt gave him the power of super speed. With his new team and powers, Barry becomes 'The Flash' and fights crime in Central City.  The plot of the show itself is rich. It's like the holy chocolate that only kings eat its so rich. The plot twists and turns like a mountain road and leaves you wanting even more every time the end of the hour strikes. The beginning of the show is the slowest it will ever be, and that is the only bad remark I have about the show. For me, it was around the 7th or 8th episodes that things start getting very, very interesting. Don't worry my faithful reader, I won't spoil anything for you. The show is currently halfway through the second season and its even better than the rest. This show is gaining its tread and it is becoming the show of the century. ","8"
"The Flash",2016-05-14," I really, honestly don't understand how such an awful show like this can have such a high rating, when we have other shows like House of Cards, Breaking Bad or the Vikings to compare them to. I barely managed to get through with the pilot, it was so terribly awful, cringe worthy. So fast paced, predictable and cliché, with pointless drama and pointless dialogue and missing dialogue from key scenes. Felt as if the writers did their best to gather every peak in a possible plot and mix it up in one episode. Horrible. Sorry, but is absolutely terrible. They could have filled an entire series with the turns and twists of the first episode only. And even if the actors are pretty good, feels like is such a children's show. ","1"
"The Flash",2016-05-13," I'm astonished at the proliferation of high praise for this series. They took a charming cast playing likable characters and ran it into the ground with an onslaught of plot holes and an intolerable inconsistency, with respect to the powers Flash displays. I'll start with the good: I really loved the characters in this show. I found the evolving relationship between Barry and his foster father Joe (expertly played by Jesse L. Martin) to be very touching. There were a couple exchanges between them that miraculously coincided with some dust getting in my eyes, causing them to water. I enjoyed many of the other characters nearly as much.Now for the bad:Leaving aside the utter lack of physics, which should be glaringly obvious to anyone who passed 8th grade science, I'll focus on the show's inconsistencies:In some episodes, the flash has trouble with his clothing catching on fire due to the immense friction with the air he generates from running so fast. In one case, he sets a girl down after carrying her along with him at super speed, and she has to quickly tear her shirt off as it had caught fire. Yet in many other episodes, the people he takes with him have no such problems at all. I can only guess they wanted an excuse to put a pretty girl wearing a bra in front of the camera. (not to mention the fact that he accelerates from 0-500mph in about a second...which would be fatal for anyone he was  rescuing )Another glaring example is that in some instances, he is fast enough to dodge bullets and electrical discharges like a character from the matrix but in others, he is unable to dodge a punch from someone who doesn't even have enhanced speed. Human punch: ~25mph. Speed of light: 670,000,000mph. I don't want to sound like I'm being nit picky but the discrepancies are so blatant it's nearly impossible to ignore them and I find myself rolling my eyes in almost every episode. I think one of the key's to enabling an audience to suspend their disbelief in any kind story, but particularly in this genre (fantasy, sci-fi, superhero) is to remain realistic and logical, relative to whatever rules exist for the fantasy world the story is set in. The Flash fails to do this in spectacular fashion. I wanted to love this show and despite all my problems with it, I did finish the whole season. I liked the characters and the story enough that I was able to get through it, aforementioned eye rolls notwithstanding. It's my hope they'll put some more thought into this for the next season as this has the potential to be a good series. ","5"
"The Flash",2016-05-10," The Flash is the famous hero of DC comics. He is the fastest man in the world because it has the speed force that allows him to run at the speed of light. Flash has a worst enemy which is called Reverse Flash. Flash is embodied by a Barry Allen who is a agent of the scientific police. During is childhood the mother of Barry Allen was murdered by Reverse Flash and his was wrongly accused. Ten years after an explosion of particle Accelerator that is called Star Labs Barry Allen receives by an illuminated once his great meteor power. this moment until now Barry Allen as the Flash name lives only avenge his mother and to rehabilitate his Father. Flash is a series that appeared is 2015 in France this series has enormously action and suspense an that's what I like most. Then I love this series because the story is based in the universe of heroes and it is also this kind of series I prefer. Furthermore Flash is my favorite hero in the universe DC comics that is why I have chosen because I like the series with very good graphics and because the actors who played their roles well. In conclusion i can say that is one of the best series of 2014-2016 ","10"
"The Flash",2016-05-05," The producers of The Flash are Greg Berlanti, Geoff Johns, Andrew Kreisberg This TV series was produced in 2014 One day when Barry Allen was in his room trying to solve a recent crime incident there was a major storm that came to Central city. So Barry went to close his balcony shutter while closing it with a chain connected to the shutter, all of a sudden while doing that Barry was than electrocuted and was unconscious for 9 months. When Barry woke up after being in a coma he started to notice funny things about his body and weird things have been happening to him and one day Barry was running then all of a sudden hes running fast as a fresh bullet out of a gun barrel. As Barry seen his ability he immediately knew what he could do and what hes always been doing and thats stopping and fighting crime. As Barry continued to keep Central city a safe place to live but then he ran into someone thats just like him and nobody nos what could happen next? while the Flash be able to save Central city from this disaster? or will the Flash fall?The cinematography is great, everything falls in place the when the intense moments comes its extraordinary because it really gets you in the feel for the momentBarry's thoughts are to keep him, his family and Central city safe from danger. The theme is achieved because Barry keeps the city safe from the dangers that come to Central cityEnd conclusion The Flash is an awesome TV series and i watch it every Tuesday. The way the story is set up it brings more passion and entertainment to the film to make the watchers more and more entertainment because of how awesome The Flash is and the story line so I would have to give it a perfect 10/10.

"The Flash",2016-05-05," I recently watched Daredevil and man,it blew me away.I though of starting with some show along similar lines and with all the rave reviews surrounding it,i thought Flash would be a good point to start.I began watching flash and my first response was..meh...these guys need to learn something from the Daredevil.It wasn't bad was but was remarkably average.Nothing like what i had hoped for.With all the cheesy dialogues and illogical stuff going around, i almost thought of discontinuing the TV show.But i am so glad i didn't, because each episode after the first 8 has been a roller-coaster ride.The acting done by different cast members is immaculate,especially the guy who plays the role of Wells.The show is a great combination of sci-fi,action,humor and romance.The show completely had me hooked.Must watch show for all superhero movie fans!And it has the best finale ever(season 1). ","9"
"The Flash",2016-05-04," The entire series and it's intelligence can be summed up in one sentence:According to the show, the proper way to get rid of a giant destructive black hole is to punch it really really hard and then blow it up. ARE YOU FREAKING KIDDING ME?!The characters are worse than simply unrelatable, they are annoying and often you end up hating them. They make the same obvious mistakes over and the plot is repetitive to the point there is actually a formula for it. Barry charges in like an idiot, gets beaten, returns to create a scientifically BS plan, then go back out and get a  motivational three word speech , every episode.The drama is overly forced and often the solution is so obvious to the viewer. And basically half the character's are whining spoiled morons (IRIS), that create unneeded drama for the decent characters even when the decent character has done nothing wrong, then forces the good character to apologize for the sake of  character development .AN UTTER INSULT TO SCIENCE. The science makes no sense and breaks even kindergarten level science lessons. And even worse, they constantly try to cover it up by using fancy big science words thinking their audience is too stupid to figure out what they're saying. Well I hate to break it to you, but this is a comic book series, which means the audience that your trying to fool are science geeks like myself, BRILLIANT PLAN!The music like in most CW shows is loud and blares over the dialogue to the point you cant even here the speakers, and the upbeat music makes any serious and genuinely dramatic moments into jokes. And finally, also like most CW shows the dialogue is terrible and doesn't sound human or natural. ","6"
"The Flash",2016-05-03," I'm a huge fan of superheroes, so I may be a little biased in my review of the show, but it is not a terrible show. I will admit that the script can get really cheesy at times which really turns people away from the show the first couple of episodes, but if you can get through that then the rest of the show is pretty decent acting and content wise. The acting isn't so bad either, but Iris is my least favorite on the show and it makes me cringe when she speaks. I like how they use original villains from older story lines, like captain cold, and add a more modern touch to them. All in all it is a decent show and I think you should take the time to watch past the first few episodes if you don't like cheesy acting. ","8"
"The Flash",2016-04-30," OK firstly I am a big fan of the show. It's one of the few shows I watch. But some episodes are just crazy. I mean a man shark seriously? And what on both Earths was the point of reopening the breach? They had found out Zoom was Jay/Hunter. They knew he was sick and dying. So why reopen the breach and try to confront him? WHY not leave him to succumb to his cellular degeneration? DUMBEST episode I ever saw! It is followed by more dumb episodes, but I hope once the show gets out of this insane story arc that it will get better, as it has done before. Don't get me wrong, I do like this show...just above off my chest. I also wish they did not do an AU thing with the supergirl crossover...too bad, Flash and Supergirl make a great couple. ","8"
"The Flash",2016-04-25,"  My name is Barry Allen and I am the fastest man alive  - But every other speedster on the show is 100000000 times faster than this piece of poorly written and played character(even the new speedsters who just got their speed).  I hunted down the man who killed my mother  - No duh you did. He didn't even remotely hunt him down, it's actually the opposite way around and in the end it was not even him who defeated the reverse flash. It was because of eddie the reverse flash was defeated. And Gaaaawwwddddd !! The actor is terrible.He always talks as if he's got a tampon size ice cube up his arse. Not to mention the writing of the show is so cringeworthy, the flash heavily depends on other character's advice to use his powers. The flash himself is an intelligent personality who can figure counter measures on his own. Remember with his ability to run faster came the ability to think faster and better.This show gets pretty REPETITIVE. A new villain shows up in an episode -> Flash shows up -> Gets beating -> Runs like a pussy -> Takes advice from his friends -> They come up with some lame and pretty basic advice -> Flash returns to villain with his new  move  and you know how it goes. What is this ? Power rangers ? This series is not even remotely close to the comic version of flash. Just a bunch of immature people getting together to destroy a good comic character. For the people who are watching Flash for the first time- Please do not judge flash's powers based on this series. This is an utter disaster and the Flash is not as dumb or whiny as they depict him in this show. ","1"
"The Flash",2016-04-24," This is the best TV show out there! It is filled with new surprises in every episode. The actors and actresses are amazing in acting and the story line and plot are also amazing. They have the best villains out there (Reverse Flash, Zoom and soon Godspeed. This is filled with comedy, action, suspense and thriller, it is all in one. Tuesday's are my favourite day of the week because of Flash. I love this TV show and highly recommend this to people looking to watch a good TV show. People that are writing hate comments against this TV show are just Marvel Fanboys. This is much better than Arrow, Daredevil, Agents of shield and much other out there in my opinion. BEST TV SHOW! ","10"
"The Flash",2016-04-18," Barry Allen was introduced during  Arrow  season 2, which was the show in its prime. After setting him up in the universe, they went on to make a show based entirely around Barry Allen becoming The Flash. Since  Arrow  was getting darker and darker,  The Flash  went in the opposite direction. It's the tonal antithesis of  Arrow . Lighthearted, quirky, and silly, yet grounded enough to make us care, and the writing is just as sharp and witty as you'd hope.When the characters were first introduced in the  Arrow  episode, I thought I would hate them in  The Flash . But after a few episodes, each character is developed with a certain role in the show, and it works wonders. Harrison Wells as the enigmatic mastermind behind STAR Labs, Caitlin as the straitlaced neurotic scientist, Cisco as the sarcastic pop-culture referencing comic relief who comes up with each villain's  super  name, and Barry Allen as the relatable everyman who was struck by lightning and became the fastest man alive. Then there's Barry's family - journalist Iris West, his foster sister and secret love of his life, and the detective with a heart of gold Joe West, his foster father. The best part is the chemistry between them all. There are clashes between the strict Wells and the snarky Cisco, Barry and Iris' boyfriend Eddie who you're not too sure about at first, and Eddie and Joe West with the usual  you're dating my daughter  dynamic. But none of it comes across as artificial. You believe all of the character interactions because they're developed well enough so that you're fully aware of how each person would react to each situation, and the writers are spot on when it comes to their motivations and actions. The acting itself is surprisingly great. It's refreshing in a CW show to have a likable good actor as the lead, and Grant Gustin knocks it out of the park. He's usually upbeat and quirky but when he's given the important emotional beats, he pulls them off well enough to tug at your heartstrings. Everyone else is great too, even the  freak-of-the-weeks  like Captain Cold played with appropriate coldness by Wentworth Miller. The writing is also excellent for the most part. It takes a few episodes to get going but once it starts up it does not slow down. As the story starts to unravel and the plot slowly reveals itself, it's hard to take your eyes off the screen. There are more than a few jaw-dropping episodes such as the season 1 finale, and superb looking special effects and CGI monsters, namely Gorilla Grodd and King Shark.Like  Arrow , there are some soap opera-y moments, but they're placed sparingly enough in the series that they don't take you out of the show. The dialogue is silly sometimes but that's what gives it its charm. It's not supposed to be brooding and gloomy like  Arrow ; it's light and upbeat while still delivering truly awesome comic book moments. And the threatening villains remain threatening - the Reverse-Flash is legitimately menacing, and the tone shifts appropriately for the episodes that he's in. In short, the writing is consistently great while managing to throw a few surprises at you along the way. The Flash  is a must-watch for  Arrow  fans, comic book fans, or action sci-fi fans in general. It's a fun take on the superhero genre and once it hits its stride, it delivers some of the coolest superhero ideas ever explored on TV. Sure, there's some filler, there's corniness. But when it's supposed to be emotional, it is. When it's supposed to be badass, it is. It's not a perfect show by any means, but it delivers on exactly what it sets out to.  The Flash  is a blast.

"The Flash",2016-04-14," If you wanted to watch a superhero series were the speedster kicks all villains ass then then this is the one.most of the times sci fi that tells in the story had been successful.Other than that this series doesn't have anything positive elements to tell.This series also been too simple where most of the time i felt it would had been better if this series had been animated other than making this.The cast of this series is pretty horrible.In every episode we could see the villain kicking heroes ass but eventually the hero will win.i think thats all the script of the series revolving around.the fight between the flash and reverse flash or the flash and zoom will get bored as the episodes goes.The CGI is good.the direction is good.but poor script and bad casting had been the main reason for all the mess.I believe 7 should have been the maximum rating this series should have get.

"The Flash",2016-04-12," I picked up this show, because it had a high rating. But I struggle to find any saving graces for this show. I mean the acting is poor, the writing is poor and the entire show is one big cliché.Besides that the show is also missing in depth.This show is predictable and the sci-fi is over the top. Here's an idea why don't you just use magic instead. Instead of using X particle or quantum physics for the sake of convenience.The people I would recommend this show to: 12-13 year old children.Some other people that would enjoy this show would be people that enjoy every other superhero movie. I am not saying there aren't any superhero movie/series good ones, but it's a rarity these days. ","5"
"The Flash",2016-04-04," Tuesday nights are  Flash Night  in my house. It's a time when I snuggle on the couch with my four kids, and we tune in to one of the few can't-miss shows on TV.Is some of the dialogue cheesy? Yes. Are some of the plots thin? Yes. But this is a comic-book show, and comics are cheesy and full of all-too-convenient plot devices. I'm OK with that.What I love about this show is that it is (generally) safe for young audiences, with very little objectionable material. My kids are enthralled with every move that Barry makes, and were on the edge of their seats from week to week waiting for the confrontation with Reverse Flash in Season 1 and now Zoom in Season 2.If you're looking for Shakespearean depth, look elsewhere. If you're looking for fun, this show delivers. ","9"
"The Flash",2016-04-03," It was when i reached season 1 episode 15 when i gave up on this show. Yes the special effects are good and other aspects of this TV show are good but this show is also bad in some ways. first of all its kind of always the same thing. the flash learns of another medahuman or a criminal. flash fights medahuman/criminal and fails. The flash finds another way of fighting the criminal/medahuman and this time beats him and they trap the medahuman in S.T.A.R labs and at the end sometimes we get another secret on Harrison wells. Also i feel like the flash could be way better if it wasn't so childish. Thats the reason why I prefer Arrow and Gotham to this. They are dark and gritty at times and they are not targeting for very young audiences. Also the action sequences in the flash and the special effects(even if most of the time the special effects are good) are REALLY LIKE REALLY BADLY DONE.Like seriously.I don't know if its the same for season 2 but thats what i think of the flash. ","5"
"The Flash",2016-04-02," After being patient and watching season 1 and the first episode of season two, I hereby conclude that this show is predictable, and that means boredom. I believe anyone who was not a comics book fan before the show will agree, I mean how could they not? The first 10-15 episodes in season 1 is the same thing over and over again, no storyline is followed: a bad metahuman comes around, barry takes action and takes him down... jeez.. this predictability is what you get for excitement.A good TV show should have a storyline from the very beginning, I can only imagine how many stopped watching this show early on. It gets interesting with the story of the reverse flash and Barry for a bit, but even then it's mostly fighting bad metahumans, in other words: back to the boring and predictable. When the reverse flash is killed at the end of the season, and season two starts off informing us that there is ANOTHER evil speedster, that was the end for me. The show is so unimaginative. Plus, one might argue the acting could have been better.PS: not only are the episodes predictable in terms of action, but many lines as well. ","2"
"The Flash",2016-04-02," I sort of liked the first season of the flash. Its goofy, fun, entertaining, and its a happy nice show. The acting is not always good, the script pretty crappy, and nothing makes sense and I do not like the Caitlin and Cisco characters and there are plenty more to complain about in the first season, but just enjoy the ride and do not overthink it and the first season is worth a watch. Season 1 is perhaps a 5. The second season however crashes completely. And the first couple of episodes of the 3rd season is beyond bad, so horrific that we need to invent new words. The second is a 1 at best, and the third -10. Never seen a TV-show crash so much from season to season to season before. Personally I would rather put a nail in my eye then watch the Flash. I cannot find a single redeeming quality of the show. Everything which was bad in the first season is much worse in the second season, and in the third they even have Flash murder his own mother because he does not want to be happy! Seriously! A  hero  let the villain kills his mum because.. well, no one knows. And the few good fun goofy stuff from the first season which made it watchable is completely gone. In total this is for kids around 8y old, but even they will have a hard time believing what is going on. And I do not mean that in superhero-y way, I mean that nothing makes sense. At all. They change the power of Barry all the time, there are speedsters in every single corner and the acting is so terrible even I could do better. Please do not watch this horrible, terrible, agonizingly bad show. It is almost as bad as Gotham... brr....And for the fan boys who state they love this crap; if you do not complain about a horrible show then all we will get is a horrible show. ","1"
"The Flash",2016-03-31," When I heard Barry was getting his own show, I thought it would be just another superhero show and that it wouldn't have the down to earth feel of Arrow. I could not have been more wrong. So far, Flash has managed to take the best elements of Arrow and add the ones it didn't have.Everything about this show is amazing. Everything. The generic writing, the overall plots, the characters <U+0096> I love all of it. ESPECIALLY the characters. The main cast is lovable and believable, and the main villain of the first season is the most intriguing I think I've seen in any show ever.I hope this show keeps going for a long time! ","10"
"The Flash",2016-03-28," When I first thought about watching The Flash's season 1 on Netflix, I imagined a cheesy, childish and Disney-Esq type of show. The first 4 or 5 episodes lived to my expectations, but as the story unfolded, The Flash became a very attractive show.In the chapters in which he discovers or solves something important, you even end up with your jaw on the floor and your heart beating as fast as the flash. Yes, I have to admit that some lines are really cheesy and it sometimes lacks of logic (I mean, he can dodge a bullet and disarm groups of criminals, but he can't do the same to Captain Frost and his sidekick?), but you end up enjoying it. (Yes, I also hate Iris West, the character who only complains and makes every problem bigger)I also hated the end of season 1 where (SPOILER ALERT) he finally gets the chance to save his mother and he ends up backing out just because the flash from the future kind of made a sign for him to stop. I mean, we heard you crying every episode because you wanted to save your mother and in the end when you have the chance you just couldn't do it? And it doesn't end there, because thanks to that, he creates doors for meta-humans of other worlds to happily enter to kill him. (That sounds a lot like something Iris  The Problem Maker  West would do) But hey, he needed new problems for season 2 ;).I'm in the first episodes of season 2 and my best advice for you would be to have an open mind and accept the show's flaws so you can enjoy it and don't judge it for the first episodes (I know they're not really enjoyable). Also some of us who used to love The Flash of the comics end up thanking for some villains and details we used to love from his story. ","8"
"The Flash",2016-03-26," I don't know what people have or haven't seen so hopefully there won't be too many spoilers. So when I was younger I used to watch the Justice League cartoon and Barry Allen/the Flash was a bit of a ladies man. He was always after Wonder Woman, Hawk-girl and plenty of other women. In the TV series The Flash, Barry is quite different. In this series, Barry is a one woman kind of guy. I don't know what other people think of this but my opinion is neutral. They are just two different portrayals of the same character and both are well done. As a side note, I like how The Flash intertwines with Arrow, Supergirl and DC Legends of Tomorrow. I mean they are all from the DC universe so I like the fact that they have combined these series into a sole world and aren't entirely separate series. I like the show and I hope it doesn't become to silly like some TV shows do after a bit. ","7"
"The Flash",2016-03-25," I wanted to like this show, I really did. But when the writers consistently try to treat me like I'm a nine-year-old with ADHD, it gets old. Plot holes in this series are ENORMOUS.Who pays to keep S.T.A.R. Labs open? Who is feeding the meta-human prisoners and where do they shower? Why can Barry run faster than a bullet but not a flagpole being swung at him? There is obviously no one at the writers' table who is an actual scientist. It is apparent by the plethora of scientific errors. (500 proof alcohol?  Knots per mile? ) The dialogue is really, really bad. For example,  Barry. Run.  The chemistry between characters is forced. Plots are the same each week, save for a different villain.And consistency is a problem. Only when a punch line is needed do Barry's sneakers flame up after running or (to get her to take off her shirt) Felicity's blouse catch on fire.All in all, I am really amazed by how bad the writing on this show is and yet how highly regarded it seems to be on IMDb. To say The Flash is written more poorly than The Dukes of Hazzard or Love Boat would be an understatement. ","3"
"The Flash",2016-03-25," As i have known flash from my childhood, i have known him to be a funny guy in the comics and also the animated world. But this flash is not funny at all and always regretting about all his faults. and according to the comics wally west is iris's nephew. i am totally getting confused with the plot that is going on in the series. the vfx sound and animation is realistic and love the way it is shown. there are a lot of things a bit hard to understand and accept in the series. but i would like to congratulate all the crew for putting up such a great show. i believe unlike the movies even batman and justice league TV series should have been made and just not in the movies. in that way they can relate all DC characters to each other and form a well plotted set of how the justice league was formed. for example in smallville the green arrow has a different story and in arrow it's something else. and the flash in the smallville has a different story and the flash present has totally different. there may be change in the characters but there is no definite stories in the actual shows which can be compared with the comics. it's very important to be definite and on the point. the animated movie flashpoint paradox has a totally different texture of the plot based on the flash. so does the other movies. very difficult to relate. yet the movies and the TV series can be a bit on the basic points that they all have the same basic stories which have been going on since decades. i wish Barry Allen of this series be a quiet jolly and comedic character so that it is more enjoyable to watch.

"The Flash",2016-03-24," Initially, I had some loathing for the film but I managed to surpass it and I watched two or three episodes then watched all the episodes. Like others said the first couple of episodes were boring but as you keep on watching it becomes very thrilling and trust me you will absolutely love it and you won't feel like doing your household chores or anything.Another thing I love about the film is character development. The divergence of feelings amongst them just adds up everything! Grant Gustin perfectly plays the role of Barry Allen and is one of my favorite characters. Acting of other actors were stupendous! Just watch The Flash :) ","10"
"The Flash",2016-03-23," I being a great fan admires this show for its twist & tricks that they used to play in every episodes. Being a hungry fan, I would like to request not to take must time to release the next episodes as it forces me to try something else meanwhile. However need a faster Barry Allen like the comics who quite often use his own new tricks, kicking of everyone's back.Repeating his tricks lacks example tricks like crossing through walls are very rare. Make him more confident. More powerful. More Awesome. The best things that runs a show is its plot, which is fantastic in this series. All you need is a better Barry.Looking forward to the show.Always a thumbs up. ","9"
"The Flash",2016-03-18," OK this show is amazing finally a good show about The Flash is awesome i mean come on since Smallville i never saw a show so good... Arrow is decent but not very good for me and DC Legengs Of Tomorrow caught my eye but i still have to watch it i only saw one ep from DC LOT The Flash is awesome Barry fighting crime the whole Wells thing, Reverse Flash, Zoom, Earth-02!!! the show is really awesome i definitely gonna keep watching and i recommend it unlike Smallville i like this one more...See this show you'll love it specially if you like shows like Arrow and Smallville really watch the show dude...My name is Bruce and i watch The Flash!!

"The Flash",2016-03-16," I'm not gonna lie. I thought this show was going to be an absolute childish, and pathetic show about a guy with superpowers. I thought it was going to be a stereotypical plot like Spiderman and it's always the same thing. However, this show really blew my expectations. I didn't start the show when it first aired and instead binge watched it online, but it doesn't take away from how incredible the show is. If I learned anything, you really have to watch the show to understand how great it really is. Don't judge a book by its cover, and especially give this show a chance. It's completely different from what I expected it to be.It's mind-blowing how great the acting is also. I mean, Grant Gustin, the main character, is a phenomenal actor. I mean, you have to watch the show itself to understand what I mean. His genuine passion, humor, and intensity is indescribable. Especially with Grant, they showed an emotional and vulnerable side to him that many strong, male protagonist's lack these days. Also, I love how romance is not a main priority on this show. Yes, it is a big part of it, but the show doesn't feed to fan girls and allows the character's relationships to build with great time and detail. The undeniable, underlying chemistry between Grant Gustin and Candace Patton is not blatantly addressed all the time which also creates great anticipation for when a moment between these two come. The humor that Carlos Valdez provides is a great comic relief for times when the show brings out its intense side. Danielle Panabaker is also this great, strong, female character that is a breath of fresh air with her intelligence and personality. And Tom Cavanagh's character is developed so patiently and beautifully that you just have to watch the show to fully appreciate his style.I promise you, that this show will not disappoint. With only 2 seasons so far, still in it's second season, this show has become my favorite, hands down, and is worth to take the time out and watch! ","10"
"The Flash",2016-03-16," I love all DC characters. 'Arrow' is now my favorite TV adaptations. 'The Flash' has good stories and good actors. Nonetheless, the special effects are so-so and the Flash's outfit is downright disappointing. The cowl is passable except for the lightning ear-pieces as the lightning design has been already overused all over. The original 'wings' ear-pieces would be much more pleasing to the eye. From neck down, the outfit goes from bad to worse. It is flabby, in the wrong color, with an enormous non-aerodynamic belt buckle and a horrible pair of boots. The costume designer should go back to the silver-age flash uniform designed by Carmine Infantino. ","3"
"The Flash",2016-03-08," I still don't get, how the marvel universe is so successful in movies\cartoons\TV series and other than Batman movies, DC keeps on failing time after time. Granted, Batman and Superman are the main faces of DC comics universe, but the flash is almost always had been a fan favourite. To make such a weeping, boring series, with terrible acting and nearly always, overacting, for such a lovable character is a crime. By the way, my grade of 5/10 reflects my utmost love for Flash himself as a character. Other than that, I'd give this series a 0/10. CW was better of focusing on developing Nolan' style batman world with flash in it. That would be a definite hit, and not this atrocity. Replace everyone, change the mood and maybe the series can be a hit. ","5"
"The Flash",2016-03-05," Flash is up to these point a enjoyable, funny and at times strange, in short its a show made for nerds which everyone can past his time funnily, watching it. It really makes the character justice and introduced plots for flash comics practically perfectly. Also the support cast ,which is able to make or brake a series of that type, doesn't disappoint and they try ,despite the danger of superhuman activity, continue their lives as that is possible. That fact ties the series together , because by this point(mid season 2) flash's family and friends have to get used to super-humans running (no pun intended) around. This usually what we see in people ,for example, who lived in areas where earthquakes are common, even when a big one hits ,they stay chill and after it stops , they continue their day to day life. All in all the show is nice ,not over the top and the costume of the Scarlet Speedster looks good, go see it you want. ","9"
"The Flash",2016-02-29," This could be a wonderful show for kids if it was screened in the frame-world of the Flash but alas this is not that world. However, fortunately for the producers of the Flash, there are unwitting adults in our world who have propelled this show to a rating of 8.2 when it deserves a 5 at best.I was introduced to this show by an unwitting adult who was a colleague. I curse the day I allowed myself to be coerced into this foolhardy series that has turned into a cult favorite - Favorited by morons. My first reaction to the flash was,  why does like say like in every sentence. Is that supposed to like represent a cultural shift where like people speak like that all the time?  Dialogues: Despicable, Nausea inducing the writers of the show should write a book. I believe they are truly geniuses. In my country, we have a best selling writer that sells s**t for stories. He is an MBA graduate and an Engineer. Why I mentioned him is because the dialogues his characters deliver are better than the ones i've heard in this show.  Run Barry Run.   Yes  Do you like wanna go get a coffee or something? They have turned Barry Allen into a desperate nitwit with a fast forward button for a brain. Filler Episodes: Can you like stop with the fillers already. We're like super tired.Do I need to like, say more? 70% of the show focuses on fillers whereas the main plot goes seeping through the drain. Time travel, Many dimensions: Count on Harry to explain it using the white board and a sharpie. Even though none of it makes sense, at least Tom Cavanagh can act. By enunciating every word that is supposedly imp-ort-ant. Now repeat after me, I am a dumb ass. Good. There are multiple earths and we can travel through time though there will be irreparable consequences if we so. The simple knowledge of such a world and it s working can alter our reality. Understood? OK now lets go and Wreck havoc while we're at it. Oh, almost forgot, Barry don't forget to kiss Iris while we're there, lol. Be-cause we all know that you're never getting that in this world. ","5"
"The Flash",2016-02-26," I only watched this show because I had nothing else to do and I saw that the ratings are 8.6. The show sucked from the first episode, it's so dumb that makes you wanna hit the wall with your head. It seems like a 9 year old kid wrote the whole script. I don't even know where to begin ***Spoiler***: 1- How to hack a highly secured server? 3 seconds of hitting the keyboard, what??? 2- A man with a real gun can be easily handled by the flash, another man with a stupid ice gun seems impossible for the flash !!! 3- The flash cannot overrun bees !!! 4-   Barry: Bees are attacking again!! Felicity: Bee careful  What is that??? who wrote this sh**t? who say something like that in a situation like that?? and you can imagine how the other conversations went. 5- How to run throw things? the flash vibrates himself to air frequency !!!! what the hell is that?? 6- Barry tells everyone that he is the flash except for Iris to keep her safe?? what about the rest?? and by the way she's still not safe anyway. 7- A tsunami hitting the city how to handle this? Run fast enough back and forth to create an air barrier !! can you imagine scientists deal with tsunamis the same way? this is pure stupidity. ","2"
"The Flash",2016-02-25," I knew very little about 'the Flash' as a superhero except that he went fast. I saw this and thought I might get half an hour of some cheesy stuff to watch, but instead I got a very great show.The people who act int his are pretty great, nobody I want to ignore constantly and Grant does a great job at being The Flash. Sidekicks are although average, the show clearly makes up for it with making Barry a cool dude you'd want to hang out with or travel at lightpeed with.Good enough villains that it makes the show seem interesting enough to keep me watching.If you are hit or miss on watching this like I was, give it 3 episodes and you are very likely to keep watching. ","9"
"The Flash",2016-02-18," All of the reviews that complain about inconsistency and unbelievability are right. The physics in the show don't make sense. The way The Flash fights doesn't make sense. And his choices don't make sense.These slowly seem to be going away as the series progresses. Perhaps the writers are becoming more adept? Or maybe they are finding their grove.Anyway, the show is really crappy in the beginning, but by the end of season 1, it's quite enjoyable. There are still plenty of problems, but if you are looking for a show to watch casually and not feel depressed every time you watch it (e.g. Breaking Bad), give the whole of season 1 a shot.On to season 2 for me! ","7"
"The Flash",2016-02-16," You can write about  The Flash  as a comic-book show or a superhero show, but it makes just as much sense to write about it as a Greg Berlanti show.Mr. Berlanti doesn't get the attention that goes to one-show-at-a-time like Vince Gilligan and Matt Weiner, and he'll probably never turn out a series like  Breaking Bad  or  Mad Men.  But he and his company, Berlanti Productions, make a lot of television, and they don't turn out duds.  Everwood,   Dirty Sexy Money,   Eli Stone,   No Ordinary Family,   Brothers & Sisters,  the underrated  Golden Boy,   Arrow : in terms of light, dependable mainstream television, that list reflects a high level of quality control.And  The Flash,  beginning on Tuesday night on CW, is a good match for his style. (Mr. Berlanti is an executive producer of the show and a writer of the pilot.) Barry Allen, the man given super speed when he's hit by lightning, has gone through the usual bizarre tragedies in almost 60 years of comic-book life, but he hasn't gotten the attention of a Batman or a Wolverine. You can bring him to the screen without the accumulated angst, and that's what the wholly entertaining pilot for  The Flash  does.Sure, his father is serving a life sentence for killing his mother. That provides the mandatory long story arc, but the emphasis in the pilot is on the joy that Barry, winningly played by Grant Gustin of  Glee,  feels when he streaks through crowds or clogged streets to catch a criminal. (The super speed special effects are a mixed bag <U+0097> minimal and effective from a distance, hokey in the close-ups.)  The Flash  is notably lighter, brighter and jokier than its companion show on CW,  Arrow,  where Barry was introduced in two episodes last season. It's working quickly to achieve a comfort level, and the casting seems to reflect that: Familiar prime-time faces like Jesse L. Martin of  Law & Order  and Tom Cavanagh of  Ed  show up, playing very different father figures for Barry.Among the fall's three new comic-book shows,  Gotham  and  Constantine  were both bound to go the dark and violent route.  The Flash  goes another way, which might not endear it to the comics fans but could attract an audience just looking for something fun. ","10"
"The Flash",2016-02-12," As a child I loved all DC comics and shunned Marvel, because they just seemed silly, and continuing into the cartoon world, I have LOVED DC, I've seen all the Justice League incarnations, and the epitome of it all, Young Justice, were all brilliant.Then it happened, LIVE ACTION! I was thrilled when Arrow started, and even Flash (and the gorgeous new Supergirl), but somehow, it suddenly became SUPER silly. The plots are so full of holes you could drive trucks through them. Often times things are going great and then, duh, some stupid unrealistic move makes it all fall apart. The incredible inconsistencies continue, and IMO, Flash is falling apart as it goes on. The recent foray into  Earth 2  was completely ludicrous. The actors are doing their job, the writers need to try to pull their own weight. Almost every ep ends the same way in my head,  that was dumb .I expected far far more from you DC, but congrats, you've made me a die hard Marvel fan now, though I will hope and pray that you get the message and clean up your act. ","3"
"The Flash",2016-02-09," There must be something in the CW Network's drinking water: nearly ALL their superheroes are angst-ridden - and slow. And the Flash moves slower than the hour it takes to move thru one episode. It must be the lot of those of us who have been reading comic books for century, that when a series is made, we find nothing resembling the original. And so it is with The Flash. The secret identity? None. Exactly the same as Supergirl, where at least 10 people in the lives of the protagonist know his  secret identity.  The Flash, along with other DC heroes featured on CW, comes equipped with a  team  who help them. The team always has one or two geniuses barely past puberty, who cannot seem to think ahead, despite that genius. Cisco is absurdly dumb. blurting out Barry's name in front of Kendra, and, when confronted with a dangerous foe, is not smart enough to get out of the way, instead preferring the  <U+0085>Dude-you-are-going-down  approach, as though he's speaking to a high school rival. Barry is hopeless in battle, as is Supergirl: punch, stop, wait to get knocked down, gets whipped the first time. Repeat as needed until the last 10 minutes when he finally wins - not because of his speed (the  real  Flash could circle the Earth in less than a second: Barry takes an average of two minutes to arrive anywhere in the same city). Iris goes from a blog to becoming a reporter for the largest city newspaper in the space of two months. Her acting is passable, but no more than that, as is Barry. The writing is weak, and for people who work as detectives, they are astoundingly slow to arrive at conclusions and, the whole team could do with some quick thinking, which is not their forte. A barely passable series with poor writing, and certainly not written for adults with any deductive capabilities. ","3"
"The Flash",2016-01-28," The Flash is a show based on the comic book hero The Flash who Mom was killed by a man in a yellow suit (The reverse Flash) that can run at the speed of light but years later Barry (The Flash)gets the same powers as the man who kill his mom and he must go and save his dad from prison, he went to prison for the murder of his wife.The show has got 22 episodes to its first season and has got a second season half way throw at the time of this review.The show has got a grate story and a grate casted.the show has got subplots good writersGood ","9"
"The Flash",2016-01-26," This show really is fun. Sometimes the acting seems a little over the top or a little lacking but its never bad. Grant Gustin is amazing and as the show progresses so does his acting. It gets to the point where you feel all his emotions because he portrays them so well. The show hits every emotional beat, its light hearted & fun, then it has its sad moments but the show does have its darker toned episodes. Like I said there is some cheesy moments in the show but I forgive that. None of the episodes are bad, some are definitely better than others but when this show does good it soars. I stayed invested during the whole first season and Im in the process of watching the 2nd season. I like this show a lot as far as super hero shows go its one of my favorites. If you like comic book shows and want something more light hearted than say arrow or daredevil or Jessica Jones, then you should give this a try ","8"
"The Flash",2016-01-22," I have tried to make this as spoiler free as possible.My name is Barry Allen, and I am the fastest man alive - the biggest lie in the TV series. Barry is not the fastest. First it was Reverse Flash, and now it's Zoom.Going to the review, this show is actually very fun. Grant Gustin as Flash is one of the perfect castings I have ever seen. Danielle Panabaker and Carlos Valdes as Caitlin and Cisco are very good indeed, and Candice Patton as Iris is good. But what I like the best, is Tom Cavanagh as Dr. Harrison Wells, and Jesse L. Martin as Joe.Flash always has been good, right from Episode 1. Reverse Flash was introduced very soon, and it was really interesting to watch Harrison Wells leading two lives at one - helping Barry and being Reverse Flash. And He, is the best thing about the series - both in season 1 and 2.The story is pretty good, but the only flaw about the series is that it gets boring sometimes. Like, some episodes are completely irrelevant to the story, and still they exist. But still, the remaining series is a joyful watch.With the comic relief of Carlos, Flash becomes the family superhero show - something that everyone would enjoy. Other superhero shows, like Daredevil, or even Arrow, are not exactly family shows, but this one is for everyone.Flash is a great addition to the Arrowverse. There's Carlos' humor, Barry's acting, Wells' charms, and the result is a joyful superhero show, which you can watch with your beloved ones and have fun.Season 1 - 9/10; Season 2 - 9/10I would really recommend this show for everyone out there. ","9"
"The Flash",2016-01-19," I only gave it a two to save room for things like  Birdemic .I am only two episodes in and I feel like I have irretrievably lost 80-90 minutes of my life. Season 1 is on Netflix and, having completely enjoyed both DareDevil and Jessica Jones, my teenagers and I were up for more superhero binge watching. Two episodes in and they are dozing off and I elected to clean the kitchen (again) instead of enduring the final 10 minutes.An implausible script with gaping plot holes, wooden (at best) acting and dialogue that should have died with the end of the ABC Afterschool Specials. ","2"
"The Flash",2016-01-18," The show is actually very entertaining, but it unfortunately suffers from constantly ranging between being a little dumb to going all out and being insanely stupid. It's full of potential, but would be a lot better if there weren't so many gaps in logic and moments that are way too cheesy. On the plus side it has some very likable characters and an intriguing overarching plot. If you can look past these things you'll probably like the show. It's targeted at a younger audience and similar to Smallville and Arrow, so if you like those show give the Flash a watch, but be prepared for it being the cheesiest superhero show out there. ","6"
"The Flash",2016-01-12," XD it amazes me how many people are saying  cliché, cliché.  yes this show has many clichés but how many shows do YOU watch that don't? Movies have been around for how long people? Shows are GOING to have clichés it's going to happen it's about how well it's executed and altered from the original not to mention the actors are phenomenal (sometimes a bit of overacting), don't get me wrong they don't get a free pass because of that because some movies or shows can get pretty creative and not have ANY at all. But if you're downing a show because of clichés your a moron. Now there are some things that are annoying like why can they still run star labs if they lost everything? why are barry's powers so inconsistent? why is Iris such a pain in the ass? amongst other things but out of all the shows out there this ones definitely got some of the better actors and much better effects then most. My favorite of all criticisms though is these people nitpicking about people telling barry something before he's off. THIS GUY CAN RUN FASTER ACROSS THE WORLD THAN YOU TAKE A WIZZ those 2 seconds mean nothing like at all to a guy like that idk how you consider that a criticism. all and all this shows amazing definitely a must watch for anyone if you don't like it wonderful. But don't think your some big time critic just because you can focus on all that's wrong with a show kk? ","10"
"The Flash",2016-01-11," I give it three stars for three reasons-great audio quality -great picture (when they aren't throwing c.g. speedsters everywhere) -they are very faithful to the graphic novelsBut i HATE everything else about this show. There has been some praise for various aspects of the show, such as the fact that Barry is not dark and brooding but upbeat and cheery despite his tragic past. Two things, this doesn't change the fact that the show is terrible, and this really isn't as much a good decision on behalf of the show creators, but just a faithful adaptation of barry allen as portrayed in the comics.The show has also been praised for things like having a hero that is skinny and smart rather than muscular and tough. It's being praised for promoting a good body image for young men that are slender. Fine, but it doesn't change the fact that the show is awful.I'm not prepared to say that the actors are terrible. I maintain that even the best of actors cannot survive bad writing and direction. I am much more inclined to blame the terrible writing than the acting.I am myself a physics student so all of the science in this show is far more cringe worthy for me than it is for many people but i have to insist that if you are going to try to give scientific explanations for something, you MUST consult with an actual scientist. They clearly did not consult even a freshman physics student, or even a mildly well informed layman, let alone a professional. Nonetheless, i am biased when it comes to the science so won't go into it.I can't eloquently detail all of the problems i have with the show, so i'll just bullet point the ones that come to my head.-inconsistent powers-dragon ball z style formula (try all your moves, fail, get ass kicked, learn new move, beat bad guy)-iris is the F***ING WORST! there are characters that are designed for you to hate (Joffrey from GoT) and i love that they are there because i'm supposed to hate them and i do. iris, on the other hand, i am supposed to like her and root for her and berry to get together. I don't, she is the worst.-good actors are given nothing to work with. Tom Cavanagh is easily the best part of the show, though still not not good. again, this is due to the terrible writing and direction.-Repetitive-full of plot holes-I won't say that it  doesn't make sense,  because it's super easy to understand, it's just that it's dumb. Sorry, i don't have a better way to say it, it's just dumb.I have other stuff to do so i'm going to stop now, but this show seriously sucks. ","3"

I have watched every episode at least 3 times and still watch them till they come back on in January 19th. The one thing that makes the show so fun to watch is that they have put cast members from the 1990's version on this show which makes the show that much better. If you have never watched this show you need to take time and watch it from the beginning and you don't have to be a comic book nerd to have to enjoy it. I have introduced this show to so many people and they have watched it and loved it. Now if you find your self doing this please be prepared to answer questions they have about all the characters on the show. Now if this happens also introduce them to Google lmao ","10"
"The Flash",2016-01-05," More a fusnota than a review but I hope it wood help...The best part of this show is that it sticks in a golden/silver age of Barry Allen as the Flash! (If you ask me little better superhero then top Spider-man or Batman). Whole idea is that DC comics in 1960's of Flash was with Barry and very scientific. Actually I don't remember any outer comic that had small texts and real facts from actual science in there printing like that. And TV show manage to get all that plus as much as it's possible to pictures comic on TV! You can see the creators real like those comics and tried to be close to them...Good guys, bad guys, scenes, places...with difference that passed from '60s comics to 21'st century! Good job, fun watch, but watch all episodes or do not at all! ","9"
"The Flash",2016-01-02," I really gave this show a chance. I really did. It's in it's second season now. I waited to see if maybe it would stop being like Smallville. But no it was a failure like Smallville was.In Smallville EVERY episode, of the first season at least, was Clark and the gang trying to take down someone who was affected by the kryptonite. I mean it was boring. One person had control of fire, one mind control, another something else. Since they were exposed to the kryptonite during the blast when baby clark/meteorite/ship touched down on earth.It was boring, lazy writing. And The Flash is no different. In season 1 EVERY episode was about Barry and the gang fighting people that were effected by the kryptonite, whoops I mean the particle accelerator blast. It's the SAME thing. Really it is, check it out. One person controlled the wind, another could teleport, etc....Not only that the season 1 finales were exactly the same. There was a tornado of some kind, and we had one hell of a cliffhanger. I don't know about you, but these kinds of cliffhangers are very mean. It's better to wrap things up. When you leave things like this people forget what led up to it. If The Flash/Barry had fixed the singularity/tornado/whatever bs was going on, the next season would have been better set up.Even in the Avengers movies they don't do that. It would be too cruel. Sure they set things up, but the movie goes back to homeostasis. Things clam down. Since NO ONE can keep track of THAT much (R@P. I HATED the season 1 finale of The Flash, but no I gave it a chance. And boy it let me down. Season 2 is full of 8u11$#!t. Are you serious!? Someone who comes from another world calls HIS home,  EARTH 2 !? Are you fu(&!ng kidding me!? It's too much 8u11$#!t...... Also they are still doing a new person with superpowers each week, someone sent from Earth 2 now...ugh (light girl, shark man, etc.) All while ignoring actual plot. Like wasn't Barry and Iris meant to be? Then why is he dating the cop girl? Huh? Can't Barry go so fast that he can turn time back? Then why is he constantly being told he can't go fast enough? Whoops no time for this show to make sense or for plot development we gotta fight the new meta-human of the week!!!! Ugh.....Unfortunately this show will probably run for a long time. Smallville lasted 10 seasons. Simply because of the rabid fan base. EVEN the fans of the show remarked how Clark had NO chemistry with Lois in the show. But they kept watching. So if you have no standards and love the Flash no matter what boy is this the show for you! You will totally ignore how no one can tell that Clark, whoops I mean Barry is the blur, whoops I mean the streak. Even though it's blatantly obvious.... ","1"
"The Flash",2015-12-16," The Good:Effects are really good.Music is also goodStoryline is interesting and twisted nicely.The Bad: First off, very awful acting. Dialogues are very cliché and unnatural. I feel like someone is reading a book when I am watching this. Definitely the series is targeted for the general audience specially teenagers. It's one of the top 10 TV series that shows almost all of the puberty problems that you won't care to watch. Example is how he likes his best friend and don't know how to tell her, self- pity, daddy issues that you keep hearing all through out the season which makes little impact due to bad acting and predictable lines. What I hated the most is the very cheesy, very annoying punchline at the start of every episode, how is it possible to have that kind of narration without anyone cringing? ","5"
"The Flash",2015-12-12," This show does what others do not. It remains lighthearted enough that not only is it fun to watch, but kids can enjoy it as well. Adults, remember back when you were a kid, and there was one truth: Superhero shows and movies brought out the wonder and imagination that made anything possible. They were kid friendly so our parents didn't have to worry about what the can watch. That is not true in today's society. There are great superhero media out today, on TV and in the movies, but they are often so far from being kid friendly that only teens and adults should be watching them. Daredevil and Jessica Jones pushes that into only adult territory. SHIELD is overly complicated and drawn out that only a mature mind can remain interested. Even this show's predecessor Arrow, is too violent, too complicated, and to adult. This show narrows the gap. It is mature, but light, fun and still interesting. It is a show that my child has no problem getting interested in, and doesn't get bored quickly from over-complicated story lines. Barry is just a very good guy, trying to help the public from the bad guys. Simple, straight forward, no muss no fuss. The stories are engaging. The childish glee of Barry and his friend Cisco are contagious. Even when things get serious, they don't throw frenetic temper tantrums at life in general. One of the best, if not THE best, superhero shows on today. Bring the kids, bring the popcorn and sit down for some family time, something that seems lacking in today's society. ","10"
"The Flash",2015-12-11," Hearing of this new series, I was very interested to see the portrayal the iconic Marvel character of The Flash with modern graphics and storytelling, but mostly I was hoping that the acting/writing/directing would be better than the previous attempted series from the early 90's. While the graphics and technical details of this new Flash series are fair, the script seems sub-standard compared to the other Marvel series (such as Agents of Shield). Consequently, in addition to the rather young main cast, the acting tends to be off-timed, unnatural, and somewhat insincere. In time, with improved writing and a more believable acting direction, these things can improve. However, at least for the moment, it's honestly a rather cumbersome start that makes the experience feel more pubescent than its worth. ","6"
"The Flash",2015-12-10," I just finished watching the latest episode of Flash, which introduces Wally West, and this will be the last episode I watch. I look forward to hearing that the show was canceled, and I guarantee you that it will based on this new casting. The episode was great until the introduction of Wally West. Grant Gustin you've done a phenomenal job portraying Barry Allen, and I look forward to seeing you in many other things. Candice Patton and Danielle look amazing on camera, and I'm sure I'll see you again as well. This show has given me many nights of enjoyment. Take care and best of luck to the cast. ","1"
"The Flash",2015-12-07," I have to say I didn't expect this show to be as fun and entertaining as it is. the acting is mostly realistic. I can actually imagine people acting like the characters in real life situations, and the writing is brilliant. Unlike other shows, even though every episode has it's own plot, there is always a development towards the endgame. This show is a very good example on how to do a super hero show. Grant Gustin gives a reliable performance as a deep character we learn to sympathize with and at times get mad at. we get to see him grow and evolve as a super hero but also as a human being. other characters also show development as the show goes on and the outcome is an addicting, fast paced in a good way,funny show that really keeps you curious while waiting for the next episode.

"The Flash",2015-12-07," Never read the comics but don't think i want to,anymore. this show is  so lame with wooden characters,poor CGI,terrible writing.Marvel really  blew it on this one. i only checked it out cause of the high rating and  viewer ship,which it obviously doesn't deserve.everyone always have  perfect makeup and hair even though they've been in a storm or been  running faster than light?? see,these little things ruins the  originality resulting in  okay  and forgettable episodes. i just wish  the story was a bit more dark and the characters weren't as wooden as  they possibly could be??check out daredevil or Jessica Jones.those are  way better superhero adaptations compared to this piece of plastic  crap.

"The Flash",2015-12-06," This is a great show but could be better especially in the second season.  The Flash  is lucky to crossover with  Arrow  (which is a much better show that i rated 10/10). Here is a dumb scene for example: - The Flash was fighting a meta-human that is made out of  sand  or  molecules  or whatever...and then Joe finds him on the street so he and Patty take him to the Police Department. Detective Joe was in the room questioning him and Barry was outside the room talking to Patty. Couldn't he just tell the Police (as The Flash not Barry) that he recognizes him and that he is not innocent?!?!?! Barry knew what he looked like, couldn't he at least identify him at the Police Department when he was right in front of him?!?!?!?! I hated this whole episode anyways (this was one of the reasons)Arrow is the best series and is much better than  The Flash The only episode i really loved in  The Flash  was the crossover in episode 8 because it was with  Arrow  and a proof that THE GREEN ARROW is stronger, has more experience than THE FLASH is that in the crossovers and Legends Of Tomorrow, Oliver/GREEN ARROW is the one who gives all the orders to everyone. Oliver/GREEN ARROW killed himself in s04e08 of ARROW so that Barry/THE FLASH can save himself, and Barry/THE FLASH was so scared that he traveled through time. Oliver/GREEN ARROW sacrificed himself so that Barry/THE FLASH can get out and stay alive along with the others. But we all know he isn't as manly as Oliver/GREEN ARROW and he hasn't been through 3% of what Oliver has been through. +THE FLASH looks like a d*ckhead in his costume but THE GREEN ARROW looks amazing showing his massive but perfect sized arms arms and body (by Oliver i also mean Stephen) THE GREEN ARROW can send THE FLASH to sleep with one slap, not even a punch hahahahahhhhhahaahhaah But i'll still give you an 8 just because i can't give a 7.5 Bye ","8"
"The Flash",2015-12-04," I just finished watching episode twenty-three of season one, and I can say with full certainty that I absolutely hate this series, and have made a resolve never to watch another single episode EVER again. I've been burned so many times its unreal. At the end of every episode I feel dazed and emotionless due to the stupidity and utter lack of thought which has gone into this series. Each episode, instead of getting better and more interesting, only amounts to more disappointment, anger, and despair. In this post I hope to share with you several reasons why. For another take a look at the utter dryness of the characters in general, as well as a lack of personality of others. Many of the characters started out has hot-heads but then slowly degraded into talkative, moronic, frivolous patsy's. Take Iris for example, she's as stupid as she is self conceited, stubborn and selfish, but notice that over the course of the first season she did anything but improve, and towards the end seeing her stupid smiley face almost made me want to barf, even now it makes me shudder. And I'm thinking the whole time,  Barry actually likes this person? And then supposedly marries her in the future? Just how stupid do you have to BE to LIKE someone that stupid, dumb, and frivolous??  And NO, race has nothing to do with it, it could easily have been a blonde Caucasian and I would hate her all the same. Take Katelyn for another, she started out as a 'take no crap get it done hot head' tech-no chick, and then over the course of several episodes degraded into someone A-L-M-O-S-T as stupid as Iris. Other characters personalities stayed relatively static(sorta like Barry with his whiny, wimpy, cry baby personality), but only because their characters were so dry and inflexible to begin with. For another take note of the redundancy, predictability, and overall rapidity of each and every episode, as well as how not super the main protagonist Barry really is. Each episode starts out about the same: opens up to Barry running, saying something stupid, then ends up at star labs. We then later see an evil meta-human rob a bank or something, while tons of security guards never think to draw their weapons or shoot(because the last thing we'd want to do is KILL the bad guys, they need love too). We then see Barry rushing to the seen of the crime. Usually he's too late but when he isn't we are forced to sit through an average of two minutes while we wait for him to stop getting beat up, and the bad guy to make his escape. The bad guy gets away while Barry and his tech-no buddies mope at star labs. Throughout all the episodes we are forced to sit through what seems like hours of the love triangle, divided between Barry, Iris, and that blonde haired police officer(who was so dumb that I really can't remember his name at the moment), as Iris' love goes back in fourth between the two, never once actually considering to make her decision and make a commitment to either man. After some more stupid stuff Barry catches back up with the evil meta human and gets beat up again, usually worse than the first time. He is then picked up unconscious later and brought back to star labs where they mope some more. After some more stupid stuff Barry catches back up to the villain and gets beat up, again, but some other person saves him and takes out the bad guy. Afterwards instead of putting a bullet into the villain's head, they lock him up into a containment cell that has no other apparent function as part of the particle accelerator, but serves as a convenience to the screen writers so they can spend more time on figuring out how to screw as many people as possible for the next episode. I could go on and on and on about this, but it serves to show my frustration about how unpleasant each episode is to watch, and how the Flash is so wimpy and useless as an actual superhero that he may as well not have his powers at all. Another thing to consider about this series is all the plot holes. Now even the best books/movies will have at least a small one here or there, but the huge, gaping, plot holes which are littered throughout season one of The Flash are there because of the poor screen writing and story. Take for example when that one meta human steals Barrys speed powers. They eventually take him back to star labs and  jump start  his powers and bring them back by electrocuting him. However, note also that Professor Wells' also lost his original speed powers fifteen years prior, so all that time he never thought of trying that method to get his time travel speed powers back, and when he had seen how it worked on Barry he never tried it on himself? Just one of thousands of plot holes that are strewn throughout the series, and there are far too many to go over them all.I'd mention more but I'm running out of time. It is enough to say that I hate this series on many different levels. I went into this series excited to have what I thought from the trailers must be a high quality special effects superhero TV show, but I left feeling stripped of my dignity, stripped of my trust in humanity in general, and indescribably frustrated I wasted so much time. The last episode of the series ended with a cliff hanger that I do not intend to follow into season 2, and if possible I will never again watch a DC comics TV show. ","1"
"The Flash",2015-12-04," I tried very patiently sitting through the first 4 episodes of The Flash 2014.Man, it was an excruciating experience. The writing is just atrocious. The acting is mediocre. The directing is abysmal. I am astonished why horrid shows like these are so popular.Okay, The Flash is about this 10 year old school girl named Barry Allen. Yes, he acts like a 10 year old school girl that likes to just run around the corner really fast. She'll be coming around the corner really fast when she comes. And then after running around like an idiot, he likes to hold hands with killers, instead of putting them away for good. You know---so the killers can go killing a lot more people over and over again.Oh, wait. I forgot this show was targeted at 10 year old school girls. So if you are not a 10 year old girl, don't waste your time watching this garbage. If you are into more mature shows like The Walking Dead, Breaking Bad, Game of Thrones, The Leftovers, Dexter, Banshee, Daredevil, Homeland, do not watch The Flash. The Flash was written either by a 10 year old school girl or a retarded adult. Either way, it's a real pathetic excuse for a show. ","1"
"The Flash",2015-11-15," So much cheese. Made the same way as the 2002 Spiderman movie, with The Flash dude narrating his own story and that rythmic violin ala Marvel style music in the background, it's been done to death.The big problem is that the script is really poor, every line seems forced, and it doesn't help that the actors are sub par. More so, the way the story goes is very predictable and of course there's the love interest that he can't tell about his powers and of course she has a boyfriend already and he's seemingly stuck in the friend zone. Let me guess, she's gonna start liking him more when she finds out about his powers.Skip this one unless you can't get enough of cheese, oh the cheeeesiness. ","5"
"The Flash",2015-11-09," i want to ask that why he didn't ran behind Reverse Flash after her mother death and why Dr.Wells have died besides he was able to see the future ? some questions :1 why people cant see him while he was getting coffee or pizza or anything? 2 why that S.T.A.R. Lab is still working after the particle acceleration?3 if Cisco have build those meta-human cells with Dr.Wells then why Wells doesn't knows the runaway from that cell?4 how Dr.Wells ,Caitlin , Cisco and Barry knows everything about Science or machines ?5 why Barry chose not to change the past and stick to the present ? ","7"
"The Flash",2015-11-09," Well, the show started off with couple of mediocre episodes, but as the Reverse Flash plot twist built and Barry being  accelerating  (becoming faster and faster every episode) it really got astonishingly great, it deserves a credit when you see the improvement between episode 6 and episode 16 of S1. It has got another plus because of being in the same universe with Green Arrow, Atom, Hawkgirl, Hawkman, Firestorm and now Constantine (yaaay)!Of course it does have some action moments when you really see an opportunity for Barry to use his speed, but generally in fights it's like  Oh no, Cisco, Caitlin, Wells, help me! , it would be nice to see Barry winning a fight without S.T.A.R Labs for a change. S2 is going well(s) by now, really cool storyline with Earth 2, it's keeping us guessing who the Zoom is, just like R.F. in S1, that's the main problem for now in the arrow by me, it kind of feels weird to know who the main villain is and get your protagonist fight him IN s4 EPISODE 1! I like Barry and Patty relationship much, much more than Barry and Iris. The show is great, it's 9 for me because i love Flash everywhere else (not just in TV), but it should at least be a solid 8 for you when you get past first couple of episodes :) ","9"
"The Flash",2015-11-08," This may just be the best show on television. It has everything you could want in this type of show! It's funny, dramatic, interesting, suspenseful and has a certain dynamic between its characters that most shows lack. The characters have depth, they have their own unique personalities and problems, and they all have great chemistry. They also feel like real people, not dark and brooding like batman, not millionaires, but real people who feel, who cry, who laugh and smile. It's hard not to like the actors in this show. Even the villain (spoiler)wells, is like part of the family, you know he's evil, you want to hate him, but you can't! He's just too great of an actor, too amazing of a character to hate despite everything and that's something hard to come by in a TV show. It really makes you want even more of the show just for the dynamic of Barry and Dr. Wells. (End spoiler) Then we have Barry himself, he's not your average hero, he's young, he's plucky and smart, and even though he has been through great tragedy with his mother's murderer, he doesn't let that keep him back, he tries to fix what was done on that night yes, but he also knows somethings can't change and he has to keep moving forward and helping others. Cisco is my personal favourite, funny, nerdy, adorable, and yet so interesting story wise especially with what's been happening to him at the end of season 1 and start of season 2. Let's not forget the actual visual effects of this show! They're breathtaking and even better than some movies. Wide camera shops really give it a unique view when we see the flash and all the powers of the meta humans are in full glorious spectacle without being too over the top. I can never wait for the next episode of this show to premiere, and while the 2 season premieres I must admit were slightly lack-luster, there was that one or 2 mysterious scenes in the both of them that made me have to see what would happen next, then it just kept getting better and better that I couldn't even keep up with the awesomeness! To sum it up, Flash is life! :) ","10"
"The Flash",2015-11-08," I absolutely hate how the show is making Jay Garrick out to be timid and scared. This is the Golden Age Flash, he deserves some respect. I have not read any spoilers so I don't know the future direction of the show, but give him back his powers. Any fan of The Justice Society should be upset at the writers for what they are doing to the original Flash. He is a hero on his world but lost his courage on this one? He is older and wiser then Barry and the writers should be showcasing that. Also, this show and The Arrow are becoming laughable. Every recurring character has powers or wears a mask. There isn't any secret identities (I know in the comics, Oliver does go public, albeit later in his career). The monologue at the beginning of each show is not needed and somewhat funny. I am happy to finally have my comic book favourites on the big and small screen. If done right it can be great. ","7"
"The Flash",2015-11-03," Not one for these live action uncanonical series, since they dramatically de- power superheroes to ridiculous points. Never realised that it would do so as much as it did but well, that's the way it is.I never could anticipate how cringy the whole affair would be though. For example, a recent episode showed a very hoary scene of the Flash helplessly struggling to break free from King Shark's claw; the very one that Superboy one-shotted in canon. Despite the Flash having light speed reflexes and speed, the gap of time between him turning around to a not-so quickly moving arm and being caught was apparently not enough for dodging. And they can happily disregard the fact that the Flash can become intangible.It's moments like those that really make me want to screw up my face, because it's where bad acting fuses with directly contradicting events. Much lower power, much higher senselessness. But I'll give it a couple of points for some pretty SFX. ","2"
"The Flash",2015-10-29," (SORRY FOR MAKING THIS LONG) So for the record, I have no particular bias for the Flash character when I started this show. I've never read any of the comics, but I have seen a few episodes of the Justice League Animated series, but I never really saw anything that made me particularly attached. So I was surprised when I started this show!!The show, for the most part, is actually pretty entertaining. It's first few episodes start out kinda rough. Dialogue is cheesy, some of the special effects could be amazing here but garbage there. So I'm going to go in depth with the pros and address people's complaints of the show.Pros: The show, for the most part, like I said before is rather entertaining. It provides it steady amounts of twist and turns. The actors' performances were solid and they all had relatively well chemistry with each other, making scenes funny when they needed to be, or sad, serious, or strong, they managed to portray it. The special effects were really good for a television show, (even though the first 5 or 6 episodes the special effects look pretty sketchy, like how close ups of the flash running in slow-motion make him look fake and rubbery, like running from the wave after dropping of Plastique in the ocean or when he did his first Supersonic Punch on Gurder.) the music was good, and the season long plot was good to follow. Whats bothering me the most right now is how dense people are, and how they find practically stupid things to complain about. Like  OH MY GOD THIS SHOW IS NOT A GOOD REPRESENTATION OF THE CHARACTER, HIS HAIR IN THE COMICS IS BLONDE, NOT BROWN, SCREW THIS SHOW!!  Please just get your butthurt self out of here. A character is not defined by his hair color. Another issue people seem to complain about is the flash is too young, being 26 years old, while in the comics he doesn't become the Flash until he's in his 30s. Well they explain this in the plot of why they made him younger. *SPOILERS* In the plot, the Barry Allen we know in the comics is currently in the future. In a fight between the Flash and the Reverse-Flash, they travel back in time to the night that Barry Allen's mom Nora was murdered. The Flash fails in saving his mother, instead saving his younger self. After the Reverse-Flash kills Nora and tries to return to the future, he realizes that his Speed is gone. Reverse-Flash (Eobard Thawn) realizes the only way to get back is to create the Flash. In the Reverse-Flash's timeline of the future, the Particle Accelerator that gave the Flash his powers is said by Thawne to be created in 2020. But Thawne kills the original creator of the Accelerator and builds it himself in the year 2014 so that he can make the Flash sooner. WHICH MAKES THE FLASH'S AGE MAKE SENSE. In the original timeline he did become the flash at the age of 32, but in the timeline that this story takes place in, he's 26, so thats out the window.Other complaints people have is that the plots are boring, writing is dumb and the writers assume they're morons. Guys...this is a superhero show aimed at both kids and adults based on a comic book, what would you expect? There is no way you're going to get the next Batman Begins (which isn't meant for kids) or a Oscar for best Drama. It's just a show thats meant to have fun and not be taken seriously. It's definitely the best superhero show on the air right now. The arrow is the 2nd best, still entertaining, but not as fun as the flash.Anyways, this show is still a massively fun ride! The writers know exactly who the character is, and they don't care what other people think, they're having massive fun with the character and doing it to the best they can. This is a great show and I would definitely recommend it. ","9"
"The Flash",2015-10-29," When i first saw the show came out i was a little hesitant to watch it because i thought it would a cheese little show. After watching the first few episodes i was hook. The show was so good i watched all of the first season in two days. Tons of detail went into this show and you can really tell just from the pilot, not just your average superhero show. I cant wait for the rest of season 2 to come out. I've been sitting on the edge of my seat. The first season was so good I almost cried when it came to a end. (I'm not a baby when it comes to a TV show or movie) I would recommend this show to all of my friends, 10 out of 10! ","10"
"The Flash",2015-10-28," Hate to tell you but it isn't going to fly, it is too much like Saturday morning cartoons.I have to type in ten lines of text but I cannot think of anything other than telling you that this is a major flop. I do not enjoy saying this but it is true. It doesn't follow script like Ironman and Green Lantern, The set is great but the direction/director is just awful. I would guess that this is the directors first job. It is so amateur. Keep in mind I only wanted to write the first two lines but since there is a ten line limit I have to tell the complete truth but the first two lines was all it needed. ","1"
"The Flash",2015-10-27," If anyone out there is a superhero fan, you will love this series. I love superheroes and I'm a fan of the Flash, and this does the character justice. Comparisons can be made between this and the 1990 series, and, sure enough, people from the former show (John Wesley Shipp-the Flash in that show-, Amanda Pays, Mark Hamill, etc.) make appearances in this show. This starts with how he gets his powers (with a nod to Green Lantern, his friend from the Super Friends!) and goes from there.I like the characters, special effects, and the enemies, along with the episodes' stories. I loved the one with the  Reverse Flash  and the visits to his father in prison. Try watching this along with the 1990 version and see which one you like better. It might be a tough choice! *** out of **** ","9"
"The Flash",2015-10-18," It seems these days the writers of shows Do NOT even check Google for simple facts . Really , it takes about 2 minutes to find the fact : BULLETS - The average bullet travels at 2,500 feet per second (around 1,700 mph).SOUND travels at 768 miles per hour (1,126 feet per second)<U+0097>about half the speed of the bullet. SO HOW THE HELL THE FLASH saves people from being shot by running faster than the bullet and moving them out of harms way ?????According to all the episodes the flash usually gets up to 600 mph , in extreme circumstances (5,3 mile straight run) - he can reach the speed of sound (and create a sonic boom) . :-) :-) :-) Or about 800 mph ..... so ....Flash is short just about 900 mph more to be able to run as fast as the bullet . and to OUTRUN the bullet and save the person , I don't know,add 100 mph So its a really tiny oversight of a 1000 miles per hour difference. :- ) I'm not even going to mention the rest of the hundreds of discrepancies , just this one is enough. Do you also think the Earth is flat , and the Sun rotates around Hollywood ? Bravo writers ! what was the award called  Razzie  ? or something similar. ","1"
"The Flash",2015-10-18," I was a big fan of this show the first time around. I was already something of a comic fan, and this series was a great translation of the material into a series. The Flash was a great-looking show, and the actors played their parts flawlessly. John Wesley Shipp, who played the Flash, has that Bruce Campbell-like ability to portray a likable, average guy, who just happens to get super powers. His sidekick, the lovely Amanda Pays (formerly of Max Headroom) was a good, but underused, addition to the show.The special effects were surprisingly good for a TV show, although I do seem to remember some wince-inducing moments, like one villain whose costume included - unless my memory is really messing with me, which has been known to happen - a Nintendo Power Glove.On the subject of villains, they were usually done well. I highly recommend the episodes starring Mark Hamill as the Trickster. Fans of the animated Batman series will notice an early version of Hamill's Joker persona here, which is interesting since the Flash comics' Trickster character was basically a rehash of Batman's Joker in the first place.All in all, this show really didn't deserve to get canned after one season. Given another season, it could have grown into something classic. Luckily, videos of this seem fairly easy to come by, so it's still possible to check out this underrated footnote in the history of superhero television. ","10"
"The Flash",2015-10-15," This series is puzzling to me. It seems to have been written for young teens yet the nature of the content disagrees.The main character is a difficult, self-absorbed, emotionally infantile, incompetent, meat-head who seems to get by on luck alone. It's almost as if he is the antagonist because he inspires absolutely no empathy. He can't be, however, since the antagonists are portrayed in such a blatantly obvious manner that any doubt vanishes when they are on screen.The drama that commands large portions of time seems very trivial, especially considering the gravity of the situations the characters face.The cinematography is not bad.The specials effects are not bad for a modern mid-budget TV show.One season and two episodes in and I'm done.Highly recommended for other people's teenagers, as long as their intelligence is below average, or they're only half-watching while they play with their tablet. ","3"
"The Flash",2015-10-13," Great 1st season. S2 has started on a very exciting note. s2e2 trailer is looking great. Contact with another earth will be awesome to watch given that in the first season they have kept it very tight. The graphics has been very good. Don't know what is going to happen to Dr. wells' character. I have not read the comic books, so i always look forward to the next episode anxiously. The character of Barry's adopted sister seems to be shortening each episode. may be there is not much for her to do & i don't really miss that character much. but i will surely miss Dr. Wells if he starts vanishing. Although they showed him in S2E1, but as his ancestor is dead, don't know whats gonna happen to him. ","9"
"The Flash",2015-10-12," I think it's really good and it's my favourite to show ever! I can't wait to see season 2 episode 1 which is out tomorrow in England! Yay! Yay Yay Yay Yay Yay Yay Yay Yay can't wait and grant gust is the best to play the flash with his cute smirk and stuff and I love his out fit. I really need to start a campaign to make a flash shop, where they sell leather flash suits, outfits, masks and stuff like that! I would really like that and by the way, if you haven't watched it yet, I highly recommend it to ages of about ten to on hundred years old and if you like destruction, this is the show for you! Make sure that you become familiar with the arrow first because he might make a few appearances but, I'm not gonna tell you when... Lol so, as I said WATCH IT IT IS THE BEST TELEVISION SHOW EVER!!

"The Flash",2015-10-09," I watched arrow.My god, was it awful.Then I started watching flash thinking that they did a better job.I am wrong.There is nothing but bitching and whining about how his superpowers are affecting him.This is a bad drama series.The formula for this show is this:every episode an antagonist will harm flash making him retreat.Flash will go and bitch about how he has to save the city to his crew.This is repeated forever.Why don't they read the comic and make a decent series.If you want to enjoy flash superhero character, watch Justice League: The Flashpoint Paradox movie or justice league two earths movie or read the comics.If you really decided to watch this horrible series, just skip the to action scenes, they are somewhat good. ","1"
"The Flash",2015-10-09," Yep. I watched the whole season hoping it would get better. I think there has to be some sort of mass psychosis going on in certain cultural corners of our society. It is the only way I can understand why anyone besides adolescents would enjoy Flash. It is a good thing there are grittier takes on the superhero genre out there like the new Daredevil. Flash is just teen drama with a side of ridiculous action. The inconsistencies of his powers were so blatantly abused just so that they could have some sort of physical challenge for him when in reality nothing should be a problem for him. Bees? He gets taken down by bees? Dumb. ","1"
"The Flash",2015-10-08," Its really sad to see what CW is doing to these iconic action heroes. I grew up a fan of DC comics especially the Flash, and to see what CW is doing to them is just sad. Not even the their greatest foe could have ruined these heroes as badly as CW. In reality what we are being dished out here is Mills and Boone adaption of DC comics. Something no one ever would have dreamt of seeing. With all the great CGI and actors today you would think that we would get a decent true to form action comic TV series. So many great villains so many plots no need for sloppy mindless romance and chit chat. Marvel is getting it right, sadly not DC or CW. ","3"
"The Flash",2015-10-04," I'm pretty impressed with The Flash. Although it's not as dark or gritty as Arrow it still has its place in the superhero world. As someone who didn't really know much about Barry Allen or his alter ego before watching the show I am actually really enjoying it. The main cast are pretty adorable which wouldn't normally be wise for this kind of genre but I personally find they add a bit of lightness to the show. The weekly villains provide the chaos and destruction so it's pretty well balanced.I'm not going to recommend this show to the die-hard comic book fans but for the general masses who like a bit of exciting fantasy in their lives then it's a really fun entertaining show. ","8"
"The Flash",2015-10-04," I actually watched The Flash before Arrow, I thought it would confuse me or something but it didn't actually. Overall I just finished the season and I am really impressed! Everyone here is complaining about the acting or the script but that isn't really true to my opinion. Spoilers: A few points did bother me and that is that Caithlin talks a bit too much about Ronnie in the episodes before the found out Ronnie was alive. I mean, has she been talking about him that much for the past 9 months? An other thing is that Iris kind of complains to much and it becomes kind of whining about every bad thing. I mean in the episode Flash vs Arrow, she immediately doesn't trust The Flash anymore although he explained everything to her. I hope they give her more of an add to the show now that she knows Barry is the flash. And I think they should have let the viewers know that Dr. Wells is the reverse flash just a little bit later. But those are just a few points that don't really matter that much. I love the plots and I really have fallen in love with some characters. Cisko! I just love him, he is awesome. I think it is one of the best shows I have ever seen. ","10"
"The Flash",2015-10-01," The flash was great it had action and many other things a good TV show needs. But it wasn't as dark as arrow what I think made it a whole lot better. I like how they had to use CGI for many of the cut scenes but they didn't use it's over whelming power too much. I hope anyone who reads this enjoyed my review of the flash. The Flash was awesome. I recommend you go check it out. It's a great show I reckon you'll love it. And also maybe go check out other shows like the flash, e.g arrow Bye the way next season's suit looks way cooler. Go check out some of my other reviews. And for now this was my review of the flash it is on the CW network. Thank you and goodbye ","9"

"The Flash",2015-09-17," The tl;dr for those who don't want to read: A disappointing show that insults the viewer with idiotic writing to force the plot forward. Hardcore die-hard fans of The Flash will like this, but everyone else will find this to be an exercise in frustration.SPOILERS ahead. You've been warned.Okay, so I'm not the biggest DC fan. I grew up reading some Batman and maybe some Superman, but my base of knowledge is in fact more Marvel oriented than DC. That said, I do like The Flash and find him and most of the other superheroes that can access the Speed Force to be some of the most interesting characters in comics.This show does a pretty decent job of capturing how powerful The Flash can be. When he goes fast, he really goes fast. The thing is though, he's fast. Which means he should be able to solve a lot of problems very easily. But because the writers want to create a sense of tension and have him come up against obstacles he can't just bulldoze through, he doesn't use his powers in those ways. He gets into fights he should be able to easily win, but because he stops and stands there doing nothing for several minutes he gets hit many times. And then he goes fast and ends the fight in an instant. It's ridiculous.The character relations are also very poorly executed. There are so many instances of characters happening to be in the right place at the right time to hear the right thing in order to push the plot forward. It's just such lazy writing I have to wonder how much the writers even respect what they're writing. I would expect better writing from amateur level writers since they would at least be learning what sort of novice mistakes not to make. There are so many instances of a character dramatically entering the room after overhearing something that I have to wonder whether I'm watching one of those cheesy soap operas rather than something that takes itself more seriously.And then there's Iris. I'm not going to talk about how they changed her race, likely only for the sake of including an African American on their show (token racial diversity character). But even if she had been casted with an actor that was actually true to the source material, there's still no saving her from the atrocity that her character is. She's such a wishy washy character that can't decide what she wants to do that she's pretty much an insult to the  strong female character  that she's supposed to be. And then there's the scenes where she's angry at her boyfriend for keeping secrets from her. Her boyfriend that is a detective and may be legally bound to keep secrets. Her boyfriend that is in fact keeping a secret that if he reveals may put many people in grave danger. And we have Iris getting angry at her boyfriend for keeping secrets because she doesn't think people in a relationship are allowed to keep secrets. Right. Wow. Such horrid writing. Her character is completely ruined by it. It's obvious this happened to push the plot forward, but it could have been done so much better that all I can feel is disappointment.I mean, not everything is bad with this show. There is a lot of fanservice, hinting at many DC heroes and villains that any devoted fan will be delighted to see. The spin the television show has on many of these characters is interesting, and it's definitely cool to see The Flash go up against mainstays of his rogues gallery like Captain Freeze. And there are some scenes and ideas that show a glint of the potential the show has. The thing is though, it's just so marred by the horrible writing that it's only being held aloft by the history and fanbase behind The Flash.And at least it's staying mostly true to the comics, unlike Arrow that is really more Batman in disguise, or Gotham that essentially had nothing to do with the comics. It's always nice to see a show that actually respects its source material instead of writing something else entirely while only taking advantage of the characters for name recognition.So points for that, I guess.It's just such a disappointment for a show like this with so much potential to become so bad due to inept writers. I don't know whether they're being held back by studio meddling, as much of what comes out of CW tends to be somewhat teenage trashy. Or perhaps they think they're writing for children because they think only children like comics and thus they can get away with this sort of rubbish. I don't know. It's just very clear that the writing that's being churned out is very subpar and is a disgrace to the franchise. ","2"
"The Flash",2015-09-17," This show seems to be very polarizing on this site and others. Most people have reviewed the show immediately after the finale (which was great) had aired. This last episode avoided most of the things the show got wrong while affirming it's greatest strengths. However, the show still had a number of faults. I found Iris West, Barry Allen (the main character's) main love interest to be extremely annoying. A few others irked me too, but they eventually grew on me. Captain Cold spoke in a cartoony fashion, and the show took him too seriously for his cartoonish demeanor, and most other villains seems wasted except for Zoom, the big bad. Most of the action is forgettable, apart from a few cool set pieces, and the effects are pretty good for a basic Cable TV show. The worst part of the show is the romantic subplots (yes, that is plural for a reason), but even with those the show remains watchable. ","7"
"The Flash",2015-09-13," This is my first time writing a review, but that's just how irritating this show was for me, one word to describe this show is cliché. First of all the show is so repetitive, the villain makes a first appearance and the flash with all his speed and abilities has to lose to the villain at first and then go prepare himself in star labs then he beats the villain in a rather disappointing showdown, excuse me but I find it illogical that the flash would stop right before catching a shapeshifter just to tell him  You cant outrun me  resulting in his escape, really ? what a cliché. And yes the inconsistency of the flash's powers why isn't he able to avoid getting punched ? or speed his way out of a group of bees ? or avoid getting hit by a freezing/fire throwing gun ? it's just lazy on the writers' side to not try and find real challenges to his abilities instead of just contradicting the powers he shows in other unnecessary aspects of his life. Show is also full of plot holes, star labs is the place where everything about barry's identity is kept secret yet people just keep barging in on them like iris confirming the flash's identity, also how eddie keeping barry's identity a secret is affecting his relationship with iris is beyond me it's like they're begging for something to fill the episodes with, not to mention the corny dialogue. Also if cisco put his mind to it he can cure cancer. ","5"
"The Flash",2015-08-21," i really wanted to dislike this show, and i mean really wanted to. i was like 5 or 6 episodes behind towards the end of the season, and people were starting to say that it was better than arrow. i understood how people were beginning to doubt arrow, as half of season 3 came down to felicity instead of oliver, which really ticked me off, but i still loved arrow, and i didn't like that the flash was giving it a run for its money in its first season. i will say though, before the season finale, i might have given this show a 9 or even an 8.highlights of the show: really good plot development after suspicions begin to arise about Harrison Wells being the reverse flash, and making it so that every episode isn't just about Barry fighting some generic criminal meta human.firestorm storyline that starts with the man in the yellow suit but is actually the main plot line in the nuclear man and fallout.Leonard Snart/captain cold...great villain and excited to see more of him.arrow appearances.late season one hit wonder villains like mark martin and especially mark Hamill as the trickster. some stuff with the trickster was unnecessary, like the subplot that reveals the new trickster was actually his son. i know that when Hamill says  i am your father  they're paying tribute to the star wars movies, and even though i love star wars, it was unnecessary.low points:superhero clichés that are in a lot of live action movies/TV, like the ones that have become abundant in the MCU and arrow season 3.a lot of predictability in the first half of the season.not delving enough into the part of Barry that distinguishes himself from oliver: the fact that he wants to save everybody and be as heroic as he possibly can. the only time we really see this breakout is in the 2nd to last episode where he tries to save the criminal meta humans.the fact that all of the meta humans except like 3 were bad people, or just downright evil.the 2nd to last episode: it started off pretty good, with Barry going to Snart for help and everything, but after that all happens and Barry's plan falls through, it really seemed like they squeezed the second plot of oliver and Ronnie coming in to help Barry defeat Thawne, even if it was only a fight scene.Snart's sister. she's pointless and annoying, even if she is hot, and i hate the concept of that gold gun.now i'm going to take a couple of lines to talk about the finale. i always had the feeling that Barry wouldn't go through with the plan to save his mother, but i didn't expect it to happen that way. grant Gustin's acting took things to a whole new level, starting off with the scene in prison with his father, which was very emotional, and with Joe, also emotional, and then finally with his mother dying in his arms, and having to go through her death all over again, especially when he knew could've saved her, and would've if future Barry didn't tell him not to. that scene was incredible, heartbreaking, outstandingly acted, and mind-blowing at the same time. i wouldn't be surprised if a lot of movies couldn't pull that off. and then the way Eddie sacrificed himself to save everybody. i was predicting this since the day that we met Eddie, in the first episode. it had already been announced that reverse flash was the main villain of the first season, and someone with the same last name was in the first episode. yet at that point in the finale, i didn't expect it would happen. but the cinematography involving the shot and seeing Eddie with the blood stain on his chest was so incredible and emotional. and Candice Patton's acting finally came through, and yet another amazing one on one emotional scene was fitted into the episode, and it still wasn't too much. the only thing is, if eddie had made up his mind a couple of hours or even days earlier, he could've just gotten a vasectomy. i will say that i hated the cliffhanger though. i hate cliffhangers.

"The Flash",2015-08-19," Firstly and most importantly this show is sooo bad because of the horrible acting , cliché dialogue and terrible writing . Why can't these superhero shows are given to writers and directors of shows like game of thrones , the wire , walking dead and shows like sopranos which has got such a bravo acting and story . I have seen that most of the Marvel's show are just crap only because of the terrible acting , dialogues and character . Now coming back to Flash , this show has one positive point and that is photography rest is just a garbage . And that character iris west , oh lord !!! can somebody just shut her up !! Even the lab geeks of STARS lab who has technology and help flash are soo terrible and the dialogues are so cliché and acting is just horrible and childish type , even the comedy punches are so horrible uughhhh..!!! This show is good for children in the age group 5-15 and for those who haven't seen any serial as mentioned above by me .There are so many logical errors in this show , i mean just take one for an example that the flash has got such a high speed and even though he just stand in front of a gun point and takes the beating . And shows speed at unnecessary places . I even watched 2-3 episodes of it believing that it will get better and acting might improve but its all in vane .8/10 rating of this show is only because of the superhero fan who have read all of the flash comics and now seeing it on TV for real .

"The Flash",2015-08-17," A lot of people who rated the show poorly have credited thay too the writing and campy story plot of the first 5 epidodes, and I must say I agree.The first episodes of the flash are slow (pun intended) but the overall season and makes up for the slow start and will make you wish the second season would be here in a flash...Why its so good...1. Character development, while most hero shows fail to develop the side characters this show makes you care for every role then uses thst throughout the season.2. Acting , through the first couple epidodes the acting is laughable, but either when they knew they where getting picked up or when they became comfortable with one another they stepped up on their scting chops...3.The villain , there is only one true villain, the metahumans are training tools don't pay attention to them, the main villain is complex he makes you hate him snd feel for him, he is the ultimate villain while somehow garnering sympathy, you will be pleasantly surprised.4. The relationships... some will make you happy some will make sad , some will be as big as a tidal wave and some will disappear don't be surprised if you are rooting for relationships to fail, don't be surprised if you cry... 5. Speed kills... not pg people die, thats always good for superhero movies. ","9"
"The Flash",2015-08-15," the efforts spend to put a show together and make it live is high and i respect that...but this show is full of crap story line, if you show people as intelligent in the show then, they have to be intelligent which means the obvious has to be known, but this show portrays people as intelligent but they do 80% stupid stuff. better not watch it if you want to see something logical. This is a mix of 90% Dexter and 10% The Arrow, and it is pretty obvious. Flash is totally a meaningless show, but you know, people watch because it is a based on comic which people love and it doesn't matter until you get profit out of it. The Flash TV show is like a child being born for a billionaire, show quality is not necessary for publicity ","5"
"The Flash",2015-07-23," Spoilers are not intentional, but i may let slip something in excitement. I found this a great series, finding in equal measures thrill, joy, emotions, inspiration and above all a very nice depiction of all the heroic characteristics one can have. The characters are amazing in their roles. Except perhaps Iris West, she was really annoying sometimes. Grant Gustin really fits the image of the Flash we have in our mind who is funny and responsible in equal measures. The buildup of the story is just fantastic only to be matched by the climax of it. Though the story really gets intense near the ending it was a pleasure for me watching the first part also. Apart from all the plot points and the fights the story also have large number of comic reliefs and a feel-good feel. You can't help but like the characters present. Also a great thanks to the creators for this amazing experience. Eagerly waiting for season 2, i know the Flash won't disappoint. Have a look everyone, great show. ","10"
"The Flash",2015-07-17," First thing I wish to say is that yes I am a comic nerd. But that has nothing to do with whether or not this show was good or not. When i first saw episode 1 i was not overly keen on it. However every episode just seemed to get better and better each time ! What kept this show on air in my opinion was that it was not like Arrow where it had hardly any comedy and just full on action, The Flash was funny every episode and while Barry was not running around fighting crime, he was doing every day things we can all relate to. It has mystery and every episode ( spoiler alert) it has its viewers wanting more clues behind the mystery of Doctor Wells.If you want a super hero show I recommend this. And if that was not convincing enough listen to this. When the world around me seemed dull and dark and everything started getting depressing, the only thing that kept the happiness in my heart and the light in my eyes was The Flash. Its full of emotion, twists and comedy. Its like Seinfeld cross Arrow. It simply is not only the best super hero show, but it is the best TV show on air!If you need a show to keep you wanting more, full of action, comedy, love and mystery look no further!! Cant wait for more! ","10"
"The Flash",2015-07-11,"  The show is very childish. If it is only for kids than I guess I can praise the show. One thing irritated me throughout the show that the hero runs extremely fast and shows of his speed skills in many unnecessary ways. But when he is fighting against the villain he waits right in front of the villain to say the dialog and get his ass kicked. Flash saves people from burning building and flying car but can not take the villain to somewhere else through speed or cant even take the gun from his hand instead he waits to dodge the bullet. What type of absurd is that? Another thing I saw that there were some college kids as the most skillful researchers. No seriousness in acting only focus is on glamor. Crime happening and the flash group can see everything from their lab. The whole concept is lame than animation its just baseless. I will just say plain up that I'm only reposting this other guys review. All I will add is that he was right on target about what he said. Everything ","2"
"The Flash",2015-06-30," About the flash, creators are doing it all wrong. Please read.In the last episode, Eddy Thawne killed himself, erasing reverse flash from existence.So this means no murder of barry's mom in past,and no flash till the particle accelerator from future (1st future, before timeline was disturbed) explodes.So no blackhole would be created in central city, as in the last episode.How can he have powers by then(2015), if particle accelerator has not exploded.I know creators might wanna do the 'parallel universe' thing through black hole. No reverse flash, means no opening of portal in 2015.Until you show justice league in parallel universe, has opened the black hole to get the flash. But its just barry allen, not the flash. He just cant go run into the black hole.I hope my post gets to the creators of the Flash and I get a reply soon. Thanks for reading-Shubham Sabharwal ","9"
"The Flash",2015-06-29," You've read the comics. You've seen the cheesy 1990 version. Now brace yourself, for the best comic book adaptation of a founding member of the Justice League you will ever see on television.Meet Barry Allen, a nerd-linger who's always late to everything and has more anxiety than a teenage girl during a class presentation. He appears to be a normal nerdy dork who works in a forensics lab (naturally) His life began with tragedy when his mother was murdered by someone or something when he was just a child, the cops being the predictable idiots that they are decided to arrest his father. Now he's all grown up and actively trying to find his mothers killer, to exonerate his dad.He is suddenly hit by a bolt of lightening transforming him into the impossible.Now watch this ex glee geek Super Speedster fight crime, by running, running faster, and then running even faster than that.Brought to you by the good writers who left Arrow (leaving it in the hands of a teenage fan girl in the body of a 40 year old) but then consequentially it's on the CW so expect teenage ANGST! and love triangles, and a love interest who leads him on but also has feelings for some other poor sod.Expect sparks, literally while he runs around Central City catching criminals with the help of his sidekicks and the mysterious (and amazing) Dr Harrison Wells.With just the right amount of humour, drama and action you won't be disappointed with this newest addition to DC's TV universe.

"The Flash",2015-06-23," Because for the life of me I cannot understand how anyone over the age of 13 can find this show good in any way. I mean... cliché after cliché after cliché followed by horrendous dialog, unlikable characters, and a very dumb portrayal of the comic hero Flash. There is nothing good to note about this show. The plots are beyond dumb and remind me of 1980s cartoons... Mind you, I love some 1980s cartoons but many were very bad and were intended to do only one thing, and that was to sell toys thus no thought actually went into the shows themselves. This, on the other hand, is a fully funded stand alone show... whats their excuse such poor writing and worse plots?I definitely believe that most of the positive reviews on this site are paid for. There is no way that this many people like it. I am a nerd myself and I have about 5k comics to prove it. All my friends are nerds too. None of us can watch this show. ","1"
"The Flash",2015-06-16," Today I was going to end my life......... Just before I was going to put myself down for the long sleep something told me to quickly jump on to IMDb and check the rating for 'The Flash' to my utter horror and disbelief the people had given it a rating of 8.3. It was then when I found my calling, the world needed me, my life had turned around, I must live for the greater good, the people need the truth and I was gonna be that hero who was gonna make the stand I was to become.......... In all seriousness what I just wrote is more interesting then what I've seen of 'the flash' once again a hero was turned into a kids show. As a graphic novel fan I feel that flash has become another victim of teenage crap, hero shows need to be made for adult audiences not for children and there 'the worlds a perfect place' outlook. I gave it a little better rating as the cgi effects of the flash are well put together. I personally wouldn't put time into this, try 'Dardevil' instead ","2"
"The Flash",2015-06-12," I just want to put it out there that this show is absolutely entertaining..If you like comic book shows then this show will give you everything you want. The show has a great sense of character based humor. And they even get the drama right! Sure.I liked Grant Gustin as A Flash , He is really good at it..And the Dr. Harrison Wells he was a such an interesting character to watch, I really did love all of his scenes, His voice and dialogue delivering style is really good.Carlos Valdes is really good as Cisco and Caitlin is likable.Overall Flash is a fun science-fiction drama.I'm excited to see more of this show. ","9"
"The Flash",2015-06-10," I started watching this because i was fooled by some reviews that said the show starts to be more interesting after the first five or six episodes. Well, that is not true. I don't know how but I made it to the 10th episode. The writing is so bad. From the beginning they think you are a stupid 10yo viewer. Also, the storyline in some episodes makes no sense at all, like in the end of the episode the bad guy just appears locked up in the good guy's facilities, but nobody shows you how he got there or how that happened. And you think:  So they were after this bad guy all episode and now he just got locked up in the prison? What the hell? Did I missed something? Seriously, don't watch this. Don't waste your time. If you want to watch something from Marvel, go watch Daredevil, which isn't as bad as this. ","3"
"The Flash",2015-06-09," I wasn't a real fan of these live action superhero TV shows. It's like they can't quite capture the soul of the people or the powers. So it ends up kind of boring almost like Smallville, more of a soap opera, than a superhero epic. When I first watched this on the CW I was skeptical but then saw that one of my favorite comic writers, Geoff Johns, helped make it. So I started to take it serious I watched it and it showed the soul of the people AND the powers. Also that it takes the comic mythos to the show as well. The guy playing the Flash does a good job both as Barry Allen and the Flash. What some people also don't know about the villains of the Flash. It's that they're pretty human, almost as human as anyone on the hero's side. They just do a life of crime because that's all they know sometimes. Also the people that do Reverse Flash, Captain Cold, Heatwave, Pied Piper, and maybe even the rest of the Rouge's Gallery might be as good as the comics. I also won't tell who the Reverse Flash is because it'll spoil the surprise to it all. Anyway this is pretty good and not too serious and dark as Arrow is considered to be. ","9"
"The Flash",2015-06-09," This series owes a lot to the 1990 series  The Flash , which in many ways was better. Perhaps, the series acknowledges this by casting the actor from the 1990 series as Barry's father, a nice touch.For a TV series, the special effects are well done, though on rare occasions they are somewhat lame.As for the writing, the story throws in some surprises and keeps you guessing.Now, for the characters, Tom Cavanagh as Wells/Thawne has his character down pat. I have met people like that, people who make a deliberate attempt to appear as a good person yet are wolves in sheep's clothing. Also, Carlos Valdes is really good as Cisco, so good that one cannot picture anyone else in the part. In addition, Grant Gustin makes a likable hero.Concerning Gustin's character, the writers have made Barry Allen too naive. Really, he was surprised when a crook did not keep his promise! He should be smarter. After all, Barry is 26 years old and works for the police. One would think that he would have learned something about the world with that background.Then, the writers had Barry do something that was really irritating in the season one finale. After spending the entire season being obsessed with clearing his father and freeing him from prison and being traumatized by his mother's death, when given the chance to change all that, he does nothing!! When Wells asks why and states that Allen could have everything he wants, Barry replies he already had everything. That just demolishes what a good portion of season one spent building.Then, there is Iris. As a previous reviewer stated, the I want to know everything attitude can make her obnoxious. Also, I think it was a mistake having her discover that Barry is the Flash. Some good subplots could have been worked into later stories.Finally, Caitlin is likable and seems a better fit for Barry, the same could be said for Iris and Ronny.Once again, regarding the season one finale, the writers set up the second season for some intriguing possibilities. With Thawne wiped out of existence by Eddy: Will Barry's mother be alive and his father free? Will the real Harrison Wells be around? Will Barry get his powers in another way? To sum it up,  The Flash  is a good series and worth watching, but it does need tweaking.UPDATE:Season two is on a par with the first. Though, one good change is that they softened the character of Iris.Cavanaugh continues to give a good performance, making a good distinction between the evil Wells and the one from Earth II.I still think that the writers need to wise up the Barry Allen character. Also, they need to follow more of a logical pattern. For instance, The Flash is fast, but on encountering a villain, he does not react fast when she unleashes a sonic blast. In other words, make The Flash more competent.Finally, they should have Barry and Caitlin get together. It's just more of a fit and could make for some interesting stories.SECOND UPDATE:This series showed promise in season one, but has deteriorated with each successive season.As I said before, the writers need to wise up Barry Allen. I don't expect a superhero to be perfect, but he should at least have a level of competence. For instance, the Flash encounters a super villain; he knows the villain's powers, yet he just stands there and lets the super villain attack him. What happened to the Flash's super reflexes?Now, the current season has had too much emphasis on the relationship between Barry and Iris to the point that the series has become maudlin. It even led to the silly musical episode -- totally ridiculous.Also, enough of the speedsters! There's the Flash, Kid Flash, Girl Flash, Reverse Flash, Zoom, and now Savatar. The series only needs one speedster, the Flash.And, can't the writers be more creative when it comes to villains? Must they resort to speedsters?As may be guessed, because of the above, I am lowering my rating to five stars. ","5"
"The Flash",2015-06-07," I must start out by saying I am giving this show an '8' for sheer fact of the potential headaches. I won't say how, but if you know the 'Flash' in DC-lore, you know time-travel plays a key component in his mytho's, which the show shares. That being said, the time- travel creates several instances on the show which elevates it to another level. Why? It keeps momentum. Flash has a rocky storyline, somewhat, in terms of momentum, but it's episodes are hit-or-miss in some ways. While I found them enjoyable, people may see that some episodes don't step it up from the previous, but none fall short of the previous ones fallout, and keeps expectations going forward.That being said... the time travel introduces paradox's late in the story. I won't spoil anything, but it does get hairy. That said...As a Flash fan, I will say, this show surpasses Arrow, but only because the creative team seemed to be aware of what they did wrong with Arrow, and capitalize on that. It's got it's flaws, but if you're a fan of anything super-hero related, this show delivers. That being said, as a DC-lore fan for the Flash in particular, don't hold it to the same stone. Several things are changed, somewhat for the better, but keeps the same in some regards.I can't really sum up this show in a regards to the 'word limit' I am limited by for this review. If you like the DC-lore or just super- hero shows in general, I'd recommend the first few episodes. Patchy at first, so the first episode MAY deter people since it's obvious they were experimenting with elements, I wouldn't recommend getting an opinion until maybe five or six episodes in. Season is 23 episodes thus far, so you won't be wasting more than a few hours. This show is far from perfect, but it manages to attain a level of stability that Arrow garnered after it's first season's 'mid-season' break. It's a nice contrast to Arrow's nature, and compliments it well to show how Barry and Oliver differ as heroes/vigilantes in their own regard, while still doing what they feel is 'justice' oriented. Fan or not of Arrow, I'd say this show at least deserves a viewing, properly. If you can't get into it, fine, but ignoring the potential of the show is honestly a mistake. ","8"
"The Flash",2015-06-03," Please do yourself a favor and watch this show. It isn't perfect, but I do not have a lot to complain about. The acting is surprisingly decent, if not good. I will admit my expectations were not very high after watching other superhero shows like Arrow. However, the acting and writing for this show is solid. The storyline is well thought out and execution is even better.They subtly worked out small kinks throughout the first season, so I would say that the future looks promising. The only way that I could see the show's ratings drop, is if they unexpectedly kill off one the characters in the next season or bring on a new actor/actress whose acting is not up to par. ","9"
"The Flash",2015-06-02," Leery of the promos for this series THE FLASH (2014), based on the popular DC comic-book character, I went into this series knowing very little. After Season 1, I now know there are several versions of the Flash: Jay Garrick, Wally West, Bart Allen, and the one this show is based on...BARRY ALLEN, that the show's intro reminds us of each week!Barry Allen is played by Grant Gustin, who I must say is superb in this role! He imbibes Barry with an energy and humor that is very refreshing and makes you root for his character. Not the typical brooding, somber, super-serious hero, Barry is a breath of fresh air. Gustin has proved to the perfect choice for Barry.Thankfully, Gustin is not alone in the well-cast department. He gets tremendous support. In the Pilot, we are introduced to the rest of the the Flash cast. At the start of the show, Barry, a 25-year old forensics scientist for the Central City Police Department, has been struck by lightning at his lab at the police station. The accident was in caused by an explosion at the premier scientific facility in the city, StarLabs. Flashfoward 9 months and Barry awakens from his coma in StarLabs, where we are introduced to what would become Team Flash. Team Flash consists of Dr. Caitlin Snow (played with class, humor, and effervescence by Danielle Panabaker), a medical doctor and geneticist who had been working at Star Labs for years, Cisco Ramon (played with nonstop hilarity by scene-stealer Carlos Valdez), a brilliant IT and bioengineering expert, and last but not least Dr. Harrison Wells (brilliantly played by Tom Cavanagh in a complex, enthralling performance deserved of an Emmy nomination). Wells' is a pioneering scientist who created the PA with help from a host of the most brilliant scientific minds, including Caitlin, Cisco, Caitlin's fiancé Ronnie Raymond (Robbie Amell in a solid recurring role), a structural engineer, and a host of other scientists, some of whom died in the explosion, including Ronnie, while others abandoned Star Labs after bad press left the facility a shell of it former self. Wells, Caitlin, and Cisco are all that remain of the lab and had worked for 9 months to keep it going while Barry was in his coma. Barry and the StarLabs crew get off to a rocky start as Barry doesn't fancy himself hero material, but his new powers provide for fascinating new research opportunities for the team. In my favorite scene of the Pilot episode, in a remote location, the scientists study Barry's powers on a test run. It was this scene that established the team chemistry between Barry and the others: Barry and Cisco's mutual nerdy behavior, Barry and Wells' mentor-student relationship, and finally Barry and Caitlin. Caitlin, initially standoffish due to the loss of Ronnie, begins to come out of her shell due to Barry's friendship and positive influence. Not just professional, Barry forms strong personal bonds with the scientists over the course of the season.In Barry's personal life, at the age of 11, Barry's mother was murdered by a strange entity and his father unjustly convicted. So Barry was raised by Police Detective Joe West (superbly played by veteran actor Jesse L. Martin, from  Law and Order  fame) from the age of 11 onwards. During this time, Barry formed a lasting friendship with Joe's daughter Iris West (strongly played by the stunning Candace Patton) and eventually fell in love with her during their college years. Iris is working at Jitters, a Starbucks-type establishment, while working on her dissertation in journalism. Another key member of the equation is Detective Eddie Thawne (well played by Rick Cosnett, in a very genuine, likable performance), who is both Joe's partner and Iris' boyfriend. The situation is complicated as Barry is secretly in love with Iris, which Joe knows, Eddie senses, and Iris is oblivious to. Makes for interesting drama!During the course of Season 1, The Flash battles  Meta-Humans , a variety of people, mostly criminals, who were also affected by the PA explosion which gave them powers different from Barry's. So the team must use it's Star Labs resources to guide Barry in his fight against these powered beings. Another major plot point of Season 1 is Barry working towards proving the impossible happened the night of his mother's murder, especially since the impossible gave him his powers.A huge draw of this series is the emphasis on humor, which underlies many scenes. But also the show pulls off the emotional, dramatic scenes exceptionally well as we really feel for these characters. Many shows nowadays have a generic, interchangeable quality about them where you really don't care about the characters or what happens to them. Interestingly, for a lighthearted, comic-book show, the Flash has a lot of heart and depth. In addition to the strong cast, 'The Flash' boasts some of the best special effects in modern TV shows. The Flash effects are cool and we get a taste of them in a significant portion of every episode.There are of course a few negatives. The Barry pining for Iris reeks of Clana on 'Smallville' and that's not a good thing. I've already seen enough of the angsty hero on that show, which I don't believe is nearly as well-written than this one, and survived so many seasons mostly on it being about 'Superman' and really no other major comic book series on at the time. Also, many of the meta-human characters are one-dimensional villains so far. But there is definitely room for improvement as Caitlin and Cisco's characters are destined to have powers and so that can create a lot of drama and tension between them and Barry/Flash, as they are currently the best of friends.Season 1 overall is a success and pulled no punches. Already a hit out of the gate, I foresee 'The Flash' going for several seasons! ","9"

"The Flash",2015-05-29," When I heard from friend that Micheal Scofiled (Wentworth Miller) has appearances in flash I immediately decided to watch it.I just want to say that this show is absolutely entertaining, and I'm pretty sure that if it was completely focused on going into the science, it would be too drawn out.It works perfectly how it is, because it's not just about the science aspect of how a man can run that fast. It's a lot more optimistic and cheerful than Arrow and a lot of other shows that are on nowadays. I like how different it is. Love the Daniele Panabaker in it. I hate the part what the f**k Iris is doing in police station and on the crime scenes. because she is daughter of cop she roam in station like some spoiled childI like the greater part of the performers, and the show is truly meeting up. I'm eager to see where the story line is heading. I likewise cherish how the greater part of the on-screen characters are new faces.It gives another and energizing viewpoint on the show, on the grounds that as we're finding out about the characters, we are likewise figuring out how great these performers can act, and it consequently makes the show all the more intriguing in light of the fact that the performing artists are so flighty.I wouldn't say anyone is wrong if they don't like it, because everyone have their choices, but at least give it a chance, because this show is great. ","8"
"The Flash",2015-05-28," The first few episodes were really dull and boring showing out crappy villains, but when (spoiler) we see the true nature of Harrison wells it gets a whole lot interesting! In the middle of the season, the villains get a lot cooler and we'll also find Wentworth Miller (famously known as Micheal Scofield from Prison Break) along with Dominic Purcell(Lincoln Burrows also from Prison Break) go against Barry Allen, Captain Cold (Wentworth) here , is one bad-ass man with a grudge to destroy the Flash. We'll probably get to know more about him in the later seasons. Until here the series was watchable, but not to the extent that I'd go suggesting it to my friends. But it all changed after I watched the 23rd episode !! (season finale) (spoiler) when Barry runs to stop the black hole from sucking the entire world into it! The animations, the story line, the way the entire season gets summed up, This episode was worth it! Hence writing this review.I do agree that the series has a lot of sci fi in it which people might find difficult to comprehend, but hey, we all loved the avengers didn't we? and the whole point of it being a Science Fiction story is so that it can be out of this world and break the laws of physics. ","9"
"The Flash",2015-05-28," So The Flash is a spin-off from Arrow and is about this guy Barry Allen who can run fast and with the help of some scientist friends becomes the superhero the Flash! I really enjoyed when he first showed up in Arrow season 2 and again I enjoyed watching him here.Grant Gustin does a great job in his role, his performance was very entertaining during all the comedic, emotional and action scenes; a really good casting choice. Talking of cast, another great role is Tom Cavanagh as Harrison Wells, he was a such an interesting character to watch, I really did love all of his scenes. My favourite character was Cisco though, probably because I related most to him being a geek and I laughed at all his movie references. Joe West was also enjoyable to watch, he was basically the common sense of the show, he gave great advice, he reacted to things the same way any normal person would, he just seemed like a great father-figure and our eyes into this world.Plot-wise it was mostly your freak-of-the-week deal where they dealt with a new meta-human every week but I enjoyed it anyway, it worked for this kind of premise and allowed the series to show off Barry's various abilities. The overall arc was really engaging too and came to an epic, emotional, and downright entertaining conclusion; one of the best finale's I've seen in a long time.The special-effects weren't too bad either, you had the odd obvious CGI moment but for the most part, the Flash's running effect, the meta-human's abilities and the final scenes of last episode all looked great.The Flash really is a fun science-fiction drama; it goes to show that you don't have to make all your heroes depressingly dark and edgy, it can be fun and colourful without crossing over into cheesy (although The Flash did not outrun some cheesy lines). ","9"
"The Flash",2015-05-28," Before the show aired I was really excited and keen. However, after watching the entire season I couldn't help but be left a fair bit disappointed. Don't get me wrong there are things about the show I like its just that there was a lot of stuff I hated. For starters I hated the inconsistency of the Flash's powers. In an early episode he can move at speed A. Then in a later episode when he's supposed to be faster he moves slower then speed A. Another ting that really really ticked me of was in the first episode he says he got his name from Oiver Queen. Then they leave it and let Iris come up with the Flash. Speaking of Iris I hated how she found out about his secret. I feel like that electric zap was in there for the sole purpose of her discovering his secret. Seriously, it's never brought up anywhere else and what are the chances that it never will. There are some good episodes, some of which I really enjoyed. Despite this there are some awful ones as well. The first 8 all real like clichés to me. There's one where he loses his powers, he fights his old bully, the hero goes bad. They've all been done before and when I thought the show was picking up it went back to silly freak of the week episodes. Another thing that really annoyed me was the constant death of characters. It really annoyed me when they would create these interesting characters only to have them killed in that episode or the next. I know it didn't happen with all of them but for the most part it did. Moving on to the positives. A major positive for me was the casting. I thought every actor was a good selection and played there part excellently. I loved the Easter eggs. Farris Aircrafts, Jay Garicks hat and that glimpse of the flash museum just to name a few. A third positive was the Reverse Flash. Personally I loved the story of the Reverse Flash, it was handled very well and was super cool. Those short clips at the end of the episode were another plus especially when they teased the truth about Doctor Wells. Another thing the Flash did really well was Eddie. At first I thought he was just gonna be a big tough douche just in the show to be with Iris so Barry couldn't. However as the show progressed I found myself liking him more and more. In the end he was one of my favorite characters from season 1. In Summary, there was plenty of stuff liked about the Flash. It's just that the stuff I didn't like far outweighed the stuff I liked and left me severely disappointed. ","6"
"The Flash",2015-05-27," I was a bit worried when I saw the trailers for the Flash. I knew I was going to watch it, because I'm a fan of all things superhero, but out of all the superheroes, Flash interests me the least. He's a superhero who can run away from things. And I watched the pilot episode and it just seemed to be slightly generic. Here's love interest, here's the boyfriend so love interest is harder to get, here's the mentor, here's the father figure and here's the comic relief duo. But it started building on that, adding more depth to these characters (Except for one who I'll get to later) making us care for them and want them to survive, so each time a character gets injured, we feel it with them. I've heard lots of people going  There's no danger to Flash as he's not going to die because he's the title character  but that's not what's important. What's important is who he can save. And this makes it abundantly clear. Of course there are a few bad things to itIris. She is the love interest and it can't be more boring. She makes everything about her, even if it doesn't involve her. The world will be getting destroyed and she'll be moaning that Eddie isn't telling her police secrets. If you're going out with a police officer you should know that you're not going to get told everything because it puts you in danger! Eddie also comes across as slightly boring sometimes and I think they could have developed him a bit more. There's a subplot in the back end of the season involving him, Iris and Joe and it basically shows he has no backbone. Which could have been developed slightly with him standing up for himself, but it leads nowhereIn the end, The Flash is a great TV show and a amazing superhero show. If you haven't seen it, I advise you do although some parts may be difficult to get if you don't watch Arrow. I'm giving it 8/10 ","8"
"The Flash",2015-05-27," First episode when I watch this TV series, the plot and story quite interesting Barry Allen Job as Forensik Scientist make this movie like CSI or something like that. And when Barry got accident with Particle Acceleration it's seems like another my favorite super hero Spider Man, ordinary people with super power. At episode from 2 up to 15 story feels flat without seasoning plot that is difficult to guess. Like another Super hero they chasing some bad guys and win the battle. When Reverse Flash shows up this TV series more interesting. Have some plot ends with the question of what happens next episodes. And the stories be better and better. and we as spectator have a question what this story will be end, who is Dr. Wells actually. How Barry defeat Reverse Flash ?. I hove next episodes have more dramas and more surprises plot. The less very interesting from this serial story is romance between Barry Allen and Iris west, except at season 1 episode 15. OK just it my opinions about this TV series for superhero fans. ","9"
"The Flash",2015-05-26," The show is very childish. If it is only for kids than I guess I can praise the show. One thing irritated me throughout the show that the hero runs extremely fast and shows of his speed skills in many unnecessary ways. But when he is fighting against the villain he waits right in front of the villain to say the dialog and get his ass kicked. Flash saves people from burning building and flying car but can not take the villain to somewhere else through speed or cant even take the gun from his hand instead he waits to dodge the bullet. What type of absurd is that? Another thing I saw that there were some college kids as the most skillful researchers. No seriousness in acting only focus is on glamor. Crime happening and the flash group can see everything from their lab. The whole concept is lame than animation its just baseless. ","4"
"The Flash",2015-05-26," The Flash is one of the best super hero TV series nowadays, surely the early episodes were a bit disappointing due to the use of in almost every episode  The monster of the week . But as the show progressed and when the main villain was presented, it only got better. One aspect that makes it more interesting is the shared universe with other super heroes TV shows, creating such enormous possibilities.The light tone of the TV series and funny moments contribute enough for The Flash differentiate from other series that have a darker tone. In us develop a kind of sympathy with the characters, as the synergy and the connection grows between the characters along the episodes. In the end, The Flash shows how to make a TV series, despite being extensive, with a good story, with a good cast and in which you feel pleasure to watch it. ","9"
"The Flash",2015-05-26," Flash is another superhero subject.The regular trend of superheros is followed by the director.Giving suspense is making this TV series very interesting.Barry Allen and his love scenes are similar to the arrow. Character and the actors are very fit to their characters.Flash and his unit trusting the Professor wells and he is the main villain for flash.This sequence is making the series very interesting.The concept which they are using is new and complicated to the usual people like me but they didn't give more priority to the action.That make very interesting.All over flash is interesting and useful way to waste our time. ","9"
"The Flash",2015-05-22," Had the misfortune of sitting through the first episode of 'Flash'. I had moderate expectations going into this on the basis of its IMDb rating. However, it turned out to be your average clichéd, bore-fest. You have your typical teen drama, pathetic acting, and a boring main character. Avoid this if you value your time. It is beyond me how anyone could gain enjoyment form this crap. It has potential to be a great show for kids and childish, naive adults. Anyone over 18 who thinks this show is anything near 8/10, has either never seen a television show or movie in their entire life or has an abnormally underdeveloped brain. (stupid). ","1"
"The Flash",2015-05-20," Zesty may be a word you would usually associate with food. Something with a lot of flavour and maybe a little spice. Well for me that definition really fits The Flash. There's a hell of a lot to like here. This series has real pace, it frenetic, just like its hero. There are moments of introspection but this sits alongside round after round of really well crafted action scenes which are kept interesting by an abundance of genuinely novel plot twists and turns. Combine this with some really decent acting and a dash of spice in the form of a love triangle and some pretty out there villains and you have a real winner in this series. Eight out of ten from me. ","8"
"The Flash",2015-05-20," i think that the flash was awful. i know many people would disagree with me but this is just my opinion. The pace of the story line is just way too slow. The plot is weak and the only reason people even watch this show is because they think that the super hero in this show is cool, not because of the plot. The whole show feels way too cliché and not enough originality.I definitely would not ever recommend this to anyone unless except for ten year old kids who just care about the superhero.that is why i am just gonna give this show a one out of ten. I would give it even less stars but it doesn't let me. In conclusion i think that watching this show was a complete waste of my time but if you want a cool superhero show with great plot this is not it. ","1"
"The Flash",2015-05-19," I saw the first episode of The Flash on the recommendation of my cousin.He said that this one is best TV series out there.As he make me see the first episode I was left amazed.I already Saw TV series like Arrow,Gotham Vampire diaries and many more but this one really impressed me.I just wanted to see the whole season.As the season progressed its story became even more interesting.The cross over of Arrow and Flash was always the best.Episode 8 features Arrow with some nice twists.Episode 22 and 23 still being the best.Acting was best from everyone especially Grant Gustin playing Barry Allen or the Flash.His charm makes the show even more lovely.Overall the show is my favourite of all time and it has a lot to offer.Really see one episode and you will not be disappointed. ","10"
"The Flash",2015-05-18," I watch a lot of TV series and this is the best so far especially if you watch it at the same time as arrow. They've made each episode exciting and relevant to the main story line and they've opened it up for a number of different characters to come in and also intertwine with other series like arrow. The only thing that I could complain about is that there isn't a correct order to watch the arrow/flash in. I wish they would have cast Grant as the Flash in the upcoming Justice League film and I think that it was a massive mistake not to. Also I hope it works well with the upcoming Legends of Tomorrow TV series because I think that there's huge potential for these 3 shows to work together! ","10"
"The Flash",2015-05-13," OK, I'm sorry, but what in hell happened in the most recent episode (air Date: 5/12/15)???? I watch Arrow as well as The Flash and in Arrow,  Oliver Queen  gives his life up to be  heir to the demon  or Rash Al' Gul. Basically saying that he is NO LONGER OLIVER QUEEN. Yet in the recent episode of The Flash, Oliver leaves Nanda Par Bat and helps Barry. It doesn't make sense to me that he can go and help Barry out in CC when he almost killed his best friends and convinced them that Oliver Queen is dead. ( I have seen the trailer for the season finale for Arrow, but still) I just don't see how they could that after the last 2 episodes of Arrow have been so  counter-Oliver  ","10"
"The Flash",2015-04-18," This is the first time I felt the need of leaving a review in 4-5 years since I'm using IMDb. I can say, as a DC fan that this TV-series gets more and more disappointing. The actors are without a doubt the worst choice the casting director could have made. (I mean seriously, JD's brother as the main villain? ) . Also, the every episode is very poorly written, it's like they don't even try. Just put some clichés there and some really bad puns ( In the last episode, The Flash fights with a girl who uses bees or robotic bees to attack him and she felts the need of using puns like  get out or I'll BUZZ myself in  and after one minute uses the phrase   Do you know what it's like to be stung by someone? I will sting you now . Not sure why DC or WB allows this to happen. Marvel just released Daredevil, a character with far less potential than The Flash and for a superhero series, it is brilliant compared to this. ","2"
"The Flash",2015-04-18,"  To understand what i am going to tell you now, you have to do something first. You have to believe in impossible  - this is the first line we get to hear when we start watching the show. Well it's pretty simple. When we are talking about superheroes we have to believe impossible. I read some reviews where people are telling that it's a dumb show because some things are unbelievable and unrealistic. well, hello guys ! isn't everything about superheroes are kinda unrealistic ? The flash was one of the few shows where i get to see some amazing and cool application of science. Starting from the particle accelerator to everything that sisco makes. They are not actually unrealistic. We never know in future those stuffs may actually happen. No, I am not talking about the meta-humans. I am talking about the cool scientific stuffs.Watching the show the young generation will get inspired about science. The work of Programming, Mechanical engineering and the cool scientific machines are really cool.Not only about science but the storyline, the suspense, the twists and turns which is shown in every episodes is simply awesome. ","8"
"The Flash",2015-04-09," I couldn't keep watching its first episode completely. It is very childish and has lack of realism in very basic aspects. This is my first review here, and the disappointment by watching it made me to write a review here. Please stop making these kind of stuff!!! They should warn to watch -18 people. How is that, the guy was in coma for 9 months, but he is shaved and has makeup already!!!Even the face of actors is unrealistic. If this was a movie, i might be watched it. It is very disappointing. While superhero movies usually are unrealistic, but they always try to make you believe what they are saying. The flash, starts by every things that are not believable even in a dream. I hope, we will see much better works in the years ahead. ","1"
"The Flash",2015-04-09," Wasn't sure at first how the story would go. Didn't know all that much about the Flash character but had some knowledge. Like some of the other reviews, the first 3 or 4 episodes were okay but nothing great. After episode 5 though it really gets good. I hadn't been able to watch it but had them recorded. Watch 5 through 17 in a week or so and was hooked in after each episode. The reverse Flash really gets interesting and I was confused, but in a good, way as to who he really was. It gets explained of course and I am still left shaking my head trying to figure out what happens next. All the actors have improved as the season progresses. Still not too sure about the Iris character. They need to bring back the Arrow. That was probably one of my favorite episodes, and will have to start watching the Arrow soon. ","9"
"The Flash",2015-04-08," Disclaimer: I read a few Flash comics in my youth. Always loved the Barry Allen Flash, so I was pumped in hearing that they chose to use his version instead of Wally or Bart or any of the other speedsters.That being said, I'm enjoying the hell out of this show. I just now started watching in April '15, and I ended up marathon-viewing all 17 episodes. I love what they're doing! The uber story arc has been mostly predictable for me, knowing the characters/universe well, but it still has little surprises. The actor playing Harrison Wells is delightful, as is the Joe West portrayal. Love love love the way the super- villains are being rolled out -- it's like 1 part Smallville (event responsible for creating the monsters of the week aka super-villains), 1 part Mutant-X (thinktank HQ for the good guys seeking out their own), and 1 part something new and unique.It's a bit campy, but not as bad as many hero shows. The characters are of good character, even the bad guys. And I can't wait to see more. Full of win! ","9"
"The Flash",2015-04-06," I agree with David.L that this is a much better version of flash and it has incredible villains who make the story of Flash even exciting. I impatiently wait for its every episode because it has many twists in every episode. If you are a fan of DC characters than this is a must-watch show for you.Also there is an ongoing show GOTHAM which is also based on DC Comics. Its story is related to the Arrival of Batman in Gotham City.By the way the point is that The Flash is the best ongoing season of shows and it also has some links with the Arrow of Starling City. You can download this serial on https://kickass.to/ and their subtitles can be downloaded from www.addic7ed.com. I hope you enjoy these serials. ","10"
"The Flash",2015-03-25," Well i usually review a show after the 1st or the 2nd episode but for a show as big as this one and for the huge commercializing and publicity it got before even it premieres i had to wait ;) So i'm reviewing this after 15 episodes now and things are unexpectedly going well ,, like really well.The show plot moved amazingly from just a guy who's foolishly dealing with his new power to a guy dealing with others have somehow similar ones,, personal problems ,, comedy bits and thrilling drama. The storyline is just moving towards unpredictable characters in the show ,so some people you want expect they're bad will appear to be really bad .., the plot is still tight ,well written so far, i didn't really see any noticeable mistakes or questionable scenes ,, because  as many shows have in their first 10-15 episodes  every scene most be strong and well prepared, shot and edited months ago ..The Cast were just okay at first but when you engage with them so much in the scenes you'll see they're doing a great job ..They also bring to the show a lot of people we've seen on TV before like the  Scofield brothers  from Prison Break and  Stephen Jameson  from The Tomorrow People :)The only episode (and that's maybe only me ) which i thought was a bit off , is the one when they brought The Arrow ,, i mean it went somehow cheesy but they recovered quickly till the best episode so far and the one made me write this review,, episode 15 ... just WOW ..So overall the show started just fair then turned to maybe one of the best shows not only on CW but on TV this year ;)Well for that it is indeed recommend .

"The Flash",2015-03-24," This is the first comic book TV series I have ever watched. and I am not disappointed. The story keeps you guessing what will happen to the show and how will everything turn out. The villain on the show is not your typical villain and it's hard for you to hate the character. The story is beautifully written, week after week.Grant Gustin couldn't be more perfect to play the title role. He is Barry Allen, he is The Flash. Other characters worth praising is Cisco, Joe and Dr. Wells. All portrayed by great actors.They add characters to build up the whole Flash experience. It doesn't matter if you read the comic books, just watch the show and it will tell you the story that you need to know. You will be hooked starting from the very first episode and makes you want to watch more.I hope the show continues to be great! ","9"
"The Flash",2015-03-21," I'll admit, in the first few episodes, the show goes just a bit slow, following a  villain of the week  kind of theme. Barry and his team begin the series spending their time hunting meta-humans. But recently, ever since the mid-season finale, the show has really picked up, and began to thoroughly impress me. The first thing that is truly amazing about this show is the way it stays true to the source material. It is probably the most faithful comic book television adaptation I've seen in years. Sure, there are a few changes that may bother Flash comic book fans (like Barry having brown hair, for example) but they are usually nothing too drastic. The show has been incorporating elements of the comic book with ease ever since the first episode, introducing characters like Clyde Mardon (Marco Mardon's brother) and multiple characters that have served as enemies to the flash over the years. The acting is pretty spot on, and really gets you to believe in what is happening on your screen. Many joke of the special effects being sub- par, and that could be true, to an extent (although they never bothered me) But keep in mind that this is a CW TV show, and they don't exactly have a large enough budget to do whatever they want special effect wise. They have also chosen to follow one of the most well-loved Flash story lines for the TV show, which involves Eobard Thawne, A.K.A the Reverse Flash. They have introduced so many other Iconic villains as well, like Captain Cold, Heatwave, Weather Wizard, and soon to be more. They have also introduced so many iconic comic book heroes, such as Ronnie Raymond (A.K.A Firestorm) and Cisco Ramon (A.K.A Vibe). I will be sticking with The Flash until the very end, for the show has now officially captured my attention. If you stopped after the first few episodes, or haven't bothered to watch the show yet, please! Do your self a favor and catch up on it. You will not regret it. ","10"
"The Flash",2015-03-18," are you looking for some TV-show to watch and enjoy every episode of it??The Flash is your choice. till now I have not been disappointed from any episode , each one is just fascinating more than the previous one in an ascending order ,at the end of every episode you will always be excited to watching the next one , I Highly Recommend watching this series . The Flash is the best!!! in every way , the acting , the filming , every character plays his role perfectly ! as long as I keep talking about this series I will never talk enough , its an endless adventure/action/Sci-fiction TV show , one of the best every appeared on the TVs , there are too many scenes you will never predict to happen , you will always be surprised for what you are going to face. Guys every one should watch this TV-Show before Death~!! I mean it ! such a wonderful piece of ART!!!! ","10"
"The Flash",2015-03-11," I think this show is great, the plot is very well written and all of the spin-offs are very interesting. It was kind of boring for the first few episodes considering all it was was just the Flash chasing down different bad guys, the acting in the beginning was also pretty corny as well. One of my main problems with this show is the amount of breaks that they always take, like seriously?, they have probably taken 3 breaks this whole season and all three of them have been about a month long, like really? I don't really think that a pre-made show needs this many breaks. Since they already have all of the episodes acted out and ready to run on TV they shouldn't need breaks. It really pisses me off because it is really unprofessional. Shows like Gotham and Breaking Bad never did stuff like this. That is the only reason why I can't make up my mind as to whether or not I should keep watching the show. I would recommend to not watch it until the whole season is over that way you don't have to worry about all of these stupid pathetic breaks. ","5"
"The Flash",2015-03-09," Grant Gustin-Barry Allen Very Weak Actor Seems like a kid in most of his character all most weak like he is Not all grown up . What I find amazing is he is still has hope for a girl who clearly just likes him. He has a feminine personally yet most women I know are stronger. I just don't care for a hero's not able to Man up or woman up he is just lame. On another note I love the Idea of the flash and his comic book style of reality. Plot is interesting but some of this goes to far into a lesson plan or something. The rest of the actors fit well.I guess what I really like about the flash Is the team work .Yet there is a fly in the ointment You will just have to watch to find out what it is ! ","7"
"The Flash",2015-03-09," This is an excellent series that really feels and looks good. Everything about it is good. The cast&acting is better then average. Every episode is action filled and has a villain in it witch is very good and makes me want to keep on watching. Can't wait to see how the flash keeps on progressing into something great. In my opinion The Flash is allot better then The Arrow. I really hope this series can keep on delivering and that there will be many more seasons to come. If you like comic book heroes,action & a tiny bit of romance then this is something for you. Also if you have watched Smallville or the arrow then this is the perfect combo of that. I don't have much more to say other then keep up the good work. ","10"
"The Flash",2015-03-07," My daughter (8) and I both enjoy watching this show. She got interested in Flash from her classmates at school and now awaits eagerly each week for the new episode. I had never read a Flash comic book growing up so was totally unfamiliar with it. The great part is that my daughter has now gotten me really hooked on this show. The plot lines are well devised and the show is entertaining and well-paced. Nuclear Man was probably the best episode so far with a great combination of action and good acting. The character of Dr Wells is brilliantly crafted as alternately good and evil, and Grant Gutsin gives a brilliantly nuanced performance as Barry Allen. Cant wait to find out more about the origin story as the season advances and the story of the death of Barry's mother Nora is developed further. Hope this show continues for several more seasons. ","10"
"The Flash",2015-02-20," Overall I'd say The Flash is a fairly entertaining show, and most episodes are worth watching. My opinion is not without complaints, however. My favorite character in the show would have to be Dr. Snow. Her character's dialogue is smooth, and she can be funny when appropriate. My least favorite character is Cisco. The writers make him out to be a genius, but when he's not doing scientific work, he doesn't strike me as one. His lines can be extremely cliché and/or cheesy (like when he's giving the meta-humans nicknames), and that can be bothersome. My second least favorite character is Iris. She can be very irritating, humorless, melodramatic, and hypersensitive. It also doesn't help that her actress doesn't play the part very well. I picture her as the social justice warrior of The Flash.  Joe  is a cliché in and of itself (balding good- guy cop with a goatee who's extremely protective of his  baby girl ), but that's not to say I dislike him. I like Barry, but his low self- esteem and poor social skills makes it hard for him to be my favorite. He needs an ego boost, as if being the flash isn't sufficient enough. If you can get past the clichés and cheesy dialogue, it's worth watching. ","6"
"The Flash",2015-02-19," Here is an interesting show that surprised me from the beginning. I used to watched the old 1990 The Flash TV series, so my expectation were ordinary. I thought it was going to be just another reboot, but the different and original approach they took on Flash's background story, I actually began to like it more and more.The characters are getting the screen time they deserve and the enemies are always interesting. Although the recipe of the story is a bit redundant from one episode to another (guy with superpower going nuts and Flash has to stop him over and over), I enjoy this show like a good dose of cheeseburgers. It calms my craving for adventure, action and little romance.Grant Gustin didn't strike me as a good fit for the Flash at first but the more he got on camera and the better I understood why they chose him for the role. He has a strange and calm aura about him that reminds me (I don't know why...) of Richard Gere. Great intellect, soft and timid eyes, yet a man of action. Sureness and determination are making it work for him as an actor.I'm looking forward to future episodes more than Gotham, which seem to be slowing down in ratings. I would give it a 8 of 10. ","8"
"The Flash",2015-02-11," I don't watch a lot of TV but I went to a friends house and he was excited about THE FLASH!!! So i decided to join in on it since he has a really big TV, anything on a really big TV has to be good. Unfortunately nobody has a big enough TV to make this show good.At first I was laughing but to my alarm the show nor my friend was laughing with me. This is when I realized my friend might have autism or some other developmental problems. The character interaction is awkward and the acting is hilarious. Some of the scenes like when the flash pushes someone out of the way at the speed of sound apparently they land on the floor as if they had simply fallen over, and I guess running into someone at just under 800 mph is okay. I was explained that the flashes power somehow merges onto other people when he carries them...fair enough.Just as most TV shows the guys look about 30 but also like they are 16 year olds and homosexual. The voices like the arrow who looks like he wasn't given to many doses of estrogen but unfortunately his voice does, at least under his batman mysterious voice from which I had many chuckles. The only saving grace was the girls are pretty hot, they don't fit the costume department, nor did they have any lines that wasn't causing me to hold in a laugh as to not annoy my friend. I couldn't actually finish watching with him bc I had an important errand to run called not watching TV that makes me worry for humanity when I see it's voted so grandly.I think the show would be better if they just pulled random cards out of a hat that people wrote their lunch orders on and the show was based on the flash delivering said lunches except the flash would be played by a midget with a beard and when he stops his beard grew like 20 inches and people where like wtf there is beard in my lunch! It turns out that the people who he delivers lunches to are supervillians and he always gets the orders wrong causing the villains to give up on terror bc they can't even get what they ordered for lunch right. In turn they become chefs at a restaurant called supervillain and it becomes a 5 star restaurant run by head villain rordon goatsy. Eventually they have a cookoff and the flash can show his real talent by becoming the worlds fastest chef, or not. Plot twist, the midget is actually usain bolt but he comes from a planet far away and needs to run 1 million miles to become tall again since earth gravity is stronger than his home planet, also the flash was struck by lightning but he always had his superpowers it's just that the lightning was his wake up call that he shouldn't be afraid to run fast because life is to short to worry about dying when you could be at a super-lab with your best friends who also invented a water that makes them super young looking. The arrow unfortunately had a cigarette fall in his water before he drank it permanently giving him a smokers throat. Tune in for the next episode where the day after the cook off the flash develops walking farts, imagine the conundrum he faces when he is traveling at the speed of sound. ","1"

"The Flash",2015-02-10," My 12 year old son and me watched the first part of this series tonight on cable. Normally I am not a fan of this genre but every minute was a pleasure to discover. This was amazing with a good introduction in to the story. It is the same formula as in the Batman movies. Not too complicate and easy to follow. And it worked here too as many reviews on this site confirm. There are lots of plots and twists and I was never bored. There is a good mix of suspense and research material about his power mysteries from Flash. The director did a solid job and even if some scenes could have been stolen from other marvel comics. Anyway, I had an entertaining time and I am already curious to see part two next week when Flash comes back again on TV. Even my son gives a flash rating of 10/10. ","10"
"The Flash",2015-02-04," The spoilers here are very minor and will not affect your experience if  you're the average person. Still, better safe than sorry.  WRITING (Conflicts, character actions, and dialogue)  The writing in this show is less than impressive. There is no such  thing as subtlety and half the dialogue is them throwing in the word   fast  for the hell of it. At one point, a character says to some  random thug  Freeze! Now, get on the ground or do you wanna find out  the hard way that you're not faster than a bullet?  I'm actually quite  certain that the line verbatim is worse than that.  A lot of plot points make no sense, and this is a huge problem with The  Flash in general. The Flash is so fast that few conflicts are actually  conflicts for The Flash, but rather than being creative and trying to  think up interesting conflicts, they make the characters mentally  incompetent to the point that The Flash, who can dodge a bullet, cannot  dodge a punch. This actually becomes the main plot point of an entire  episode. His inability to dodge attacks at normal speed makes no sense.  Also, he has a tendency to block bullets that he doesn't even know are  there. In one episode, he reaches behind him and pinches a random spot  behind his neck and there just happens to be a bullet there for him to  block! What an ESSENTIALLY IMPOSSIBLE COINCIDENCE! That is the laziest  writing ever.  We need our character to get shot at without getting  shot. Let's just have him randomly reach back for some reason, I'm sure  we'll figure it out in post.   There's an episode where he has to catch three motorcyclists. So, he  runs to each of them, takes them to a police station and handcuffs them  to a pole like he always does.  I'm just kidding, he creates roadblocks where he thinks they'll go so  that he can make all the motorcyclists go towards each other, and then  they won't know how to move past each other, so they'll stop and the  police can get them, at which point there will be an utterance of   Checkmate.  That last bit is also not a joke. That happened. This is  actually something that a producer and a team of writers looked over  and said  Nothing wrong here. Onwards to production!   Also, this is My Little Pony with adults watching (so, just My Little  Pony...with Rainbow Dash as the main character, I suppose). They like  to have Aesops to each episode, and they're very basic moral lessons,  or even broken ones, and then they'll do what's essentially a Dear  Celestia inner monologue at the end of each episode.  Today, I  learned...  Really? There's no subtlety in the character development at  all. At certain points, I swear the characters literally look at the  camera and go  I've really changed today. I used to think A and now I  think B.   Here's a bit of dialogue meant to be badass.  (Right before Barry's about to leave.)  Barry.  (Barry stops to see why  his peer decided to stop him during this urgent mission.)  Yes?   Run.   CONSISTENCY  There is no consistency with Barry's powers. The effects of running  really fast (friction, air compression, etc.) turn on and off randomly.  At one point, a woman's shirt burns off despite that making no sense  whatsoever, presumably because one of the writers thought that the  actress was hot and knew he had the power to get her to reveal a little  more.  As I mentioned before, he just decides not to dodge punches. Or grab  people's weapons to disarm them. He also runs slow enough for The Arrow  to see him and aim at him when he's fast enough to see bullets. Bullets  are so fast that 500 feet away, all you can do is blink before the  bullet reaches you. Otherwise, you're completely still. Everything  should be frozen for Barry, but he runs at the speed of a falcon from  time to time.  TECHNICALITIES  Bullets and guns. Don't expect them to make sense. Physics. Chemistry.  Science in general. Tensile strength being a huge factor when hitting  someone? Hearing a sonic boom from something that hasn't gotten to you  yet? A gun that creates the heat of the Big Bang? A needle the heat of  the Sun would kill everyone in at least a one thousand mile radius. A  warehouse the heat of all the energy in the universe (which, you might  notice, doesn't make sense) would evaporate all matter in the entire  solar system. But no worries here, just some second degree burns (these  were normal humans that got second degree burns, not The Flash, so no  superpowers to withstand the energy of the entire universe there). 500  proof alcohol? Iron oxide being uncommon?  Turn your brain off or get a hemorrhage. It's nice to see The Flash  moving about with live actors (though poor actors), but that's it.  That's the only pro. That's all this show gets. ","2"
"The Flash",2014-12-28," This is another example of leftists trying to infect our society with their political agenda. Let me just say that I am not racist. I am perfectly OK with black characters and would be just as mad if they used a white actor to play a black superhero like Spawn. I am upset that they have decided to use black actors to play white characters like Iris West. I feel as though they are using the story of the Flash to push a multicultural agenda on us. They can't just do that to a classic and expect people to accept it without complaint. To those who made this series - stop trying to push your anti-white agenda on us. Shame on you for putting politics first. ","1"
"The Flash",2014-12-27," The flash has the worst premiere ever, and the second episode makes things worse for any viewer. Extremely ridiculous sets of events occur starting from the moment Barry gets struck by lightning, it felt like he was deliberately holding the chains to get struck and then acquire superpowers, also the way that everybody is immediately accepting his new powers with no questioning or even the slightest shred of feeling weird. So the series introduction deserves -5/10 (yeah minus. From episode 03 and go on, It is entertaining, exciting, good fighting scenes and well-made. The fact that STAR LABS are led by 2 young scientists is making the show feels juvenile, as if it broadcasting on Disney or Nickelodeon not CW!

The 90s one was lacking villains, this one has lots of them and cross references with the Arrow quite well.The FXs are great 99% of the time, the Crisis plot is there and the characters are quite interesting.Maybe there will be an introduction to some other DC heroes like Batman and Superman as well.

"The Flash",2014-12-20," This version 2014 The Flash has a lot of actors who were part of the 1997 version of The Flash. Not sure how many actors got to work on both shows. Maybe someone of the writers and production people as well. I find this version of The Flash to be made for fans of the comic book. Nothing like seeing super heroes or in this case  meta humans  come out of the comic book and on to the big TV. There is so much to Love. The writes brought a simple story to TV viewers from a complex story line. Hope to see more meta humans in the next Seasons. The opening trailer of the The Flash 2014 version is getting kind of played out. Seems it could be remade. Then again it might be the characters narration. It seems to lack a deep voice.Looking forward to the cos play action that comes from the series. The costume department is really working strong to bring a complete experience to the viewers. ","8"

"The Flash",2014-12-15," I started watching this show only because of Arrow. Arrow, in my opinion, is the best superhero TV series out there. This, is not. I was mildly entertained throughout the first few episodes, a few plot holes or inconsistencies doesn't dissuade me, I can still like it. Then the last episode came out, #9. The show took a turn for the worse and the inconsistencies became all too apparent and the acting in this one was terrible. Everything was bad. Up to this point I'd give this show a six out of ten for the fact that I don't really care as long as the writing and acting is acceptable. But episode 9 was cringe-worthy and I started doubting my sanity. However, if you like Arrow, I think it's worth trying out and see what's going on and don't take our word for it, because it's certainly worth watching a few episodes. ","5"
"The Flash",2014-12-02," The Flash is not only one of the most brilliant new shows of 2014, it is an incredible step up for superheroes on television with more powerful actions, characters, and style than Man of Steel offered. The Flash is extraordinary. Barry Allen gets struck not just by lightning, but by an opportunity to redeem himself after a life of being left aside and pushed around. With his skills he manages to find more people like him that abuse their new powers for violence and crime. Along with the help of Caitlin Snow, Cisco Ramon, and Dr. Harrison Wells the flash battles the power possessed criminals that are out to destroy Cental City. We also can't forget about our friends in the police force Joe West and Eddie Thawne at the front of every crime. It's time for the Flash to run its way into television history. ","10"
"The Flash",2014-11-30," THIS SHOULD NOT BE CONSIDERED A SPIN-OFF! This is an evolution of superheroes, in the television show industry. 'Arrow' was created because WB/DC needed a product, similar to the chemistry of Batman and what better character than Oliver Queen/Green Arrow. I mean billionaire playboy becomes vigilante? Come on, in comparison Green Arrow is a lot like Batman, it's uncanny. Let alone the fact, that Oliver Queen and Bruce Wayne share a few similarities in their characters. As for 'Arrow' the show, it has the same dark, realistic feel that The Dark Knight trilogy had, (and the same can be said for Man of Steel). And I love that WB/DC are going this way about it. The show has proved it's worth for being an epic adventure for Oliver Queen and an awesome introduction to the character, as well as a kick ass TV show on it's own.Though in comparison between the Flash and the Green Arrow, the Flash is a much more involved and important character than the latter, in respect to the entirety of the DC universe. By this I mean, everything in some way is connected to The Flash e.g.  The Flashpoint  story arc for instance. He has more power in his tiny red gloves, than some people give him credit for. I mean, some fans of the comic books, might even say that the Flash is more important than Superman or Batman, (even though the majority of the mainstream public, look up to these defining superheroes more). I mean the Flash brought back comic books, at a time when they were deemed inappropriate for children! I am of course, referring to the beginning of the Silver Age of comic books, which began with 'The Flash'. He was the little guy, in the midst of all these other famous superheroes like Superman, Batman, Wonder Woman, Captain America and The Human Torch. Yet 'The Flash' was the underdog, that inspired and defined superhero comic books and their franchises to this date.Which leads me to this TV show...When I first saw Grant Gustin on 'Arrow', my initial thoughts weren't exactly promising toward his acting or charisma, let alone the fact that they hired a fairly unknown actor for such a big role. But how wrong I was, he's good at playing the little guy because that's what he is and that is who Barry Allen is. He's the little guy, who inspires everybody around him and it's only now that I can see the potential that the show, Grant Gustin and this incarnation of Barry holds. For every obstacle that this Barry Allen faces and overcomes, it deems himself even more worthy to becoming the definitive live action version of 'The Flash'. I mean in episode 6,  The Flash is Born  that punch was the first time that I realised and saw that this version of Flash could very well be 'The Flash'. It looked like he was nearly flying, like the very first superhero that is 'Superman'. Grant Gustin has really grown me, I just love watching him now. He's just so lovable as his character and as an actor. So cool... So, so COOL!I want this show to do so well, that WB will consider these versions of the Flash and Green Arrow to being included in the upcoming Justice League films. I mean jeez... I'm actually enjoying 'Arrow' and 'The Flash' more than 'Man of Steel'. That being said, I can't wait for 'Dawn of Justice', Ben Affleck as Batman is going to be so cool!! This opinion and want for them to include Stephen Amell and Grant Gustin in the Justice League film, stems from the reality that it's easier to create a universe in a TV show. I mean, by the time 'Dawn of Justice' comes out, Zack Snyder will only have 5 hours at best, to have shown his universe. In comparison to this, Arrow will have finished it's 4th season and The Flash will have had two seasons. By my calculations, that means that the TV show's universe will have had a total of 92 hours worth of stories and character development with a much broader universe to enjoy.For me, this Flash is 'The Flash'.

"The Flash",2014-11-10," In the beginning, I thought the acting was sub-par and that the story seems pretty boring. I'm warming up to all of the characters, especially Barry. I'm still a little turned off by Caitlin and Iris just seems like another Laurel (there for emotional investment, vapid as a character). Tom Cavanagh is the exception to all of this. I think he's a great character and I would love to see where he develops.The one thing this show does well - which is what keeps me coming back - is that they have the cheesy, awkward humor down perfectly. It's very true to the comic atmosphere and I think Grant Gustin was a great choice for Barry. My favorite part of this show so far have been a short guest appearance from Green Arrow and longer guest appearance from my favorite Arrow character. So... as far as The Flash itself, I guess I'm just not invested in anyone, yet. I will watch a few more episodes and see what they can do. ","6"
"The Flash",2014-11-10," Okay, The Flash, can run and move fast, and that's about it. This is a pretty boring 'Super Hero', and is in the bargain basement of powers and abilities, and I can't see this show getting any better with this one premise.The Barry Allen character is just so much like Peter Parker, it adds to the dullness of the show. The other characters are just cardboard, clichéd, and forgettable, and not one of them is likable. The so called mysteries surrounding Flash, are not at all gripping, and I don't find myself interested in finding out there conclusion.The only point worth mentioning is the visuals, especially when Flash battles the villain in the pilot episode.I'd say this show is strictly for under 10's only. ","3"
"The Flash",2014-11-09," Nothing in this show makes any sense.. This proves to me that American television is getting dumber and less creative by the month!The kid wakes up after nine months of being in a coma and just walks out straight away, with a tan and perfect hair.No one seems that impressed that he can run at the speed of light..The lab which blew up the whole city is still operating and although they claim to have lost everything, they can still afford to run this highly technical facility.. Oh yeah.. and its run by a bunch of kids. It seems kids are doing everything in this show.. where are the adults? Are we supposed to believe these 20 year olds are running advanced scientific laboratories? Actors look so dumb and out of place it makes me want to grab a cheese grater and slowly rub it over my face, causing me as much pain as humanly possible, only to distract myself from the fact that I just watched this show.If you cannot see how cheesy and bad this is, you have become immune to the American junk that is all around us, I urge you to watch real television. PLEASE SAVE YOURSELF THE TORTURE! ","2"
"The Flash",2014-11-05," It seem this studio continues insult the intelligence of the Audience. after they brought us  the arrow  and  the tomorrow people , 2 of the most stupid TV show ever made, they got credit to continue flood the screen with another insult TV show.I really don't get how someone can write so poor plot, unless he is 10 years old(Maybe this is the solution for this joke?).what else I really don't get is, how they get screen time with such plots? where are the good old shows like: prison break,lost(without the end),heroes,24(the first 3 seasons)?a lot of good other TV shows stooped after one season and  the arrow  is already at season 3,really??? ","1"
"The Flash",2014-11-04," This show is great. While not as great as Agengts of Shield, it is still one of the best superhero shows on air. I never thought the CW could make a show as good as Smallville was, but this show may prove me wrong. It has a lot of tie-ins with Arrow that helps build the CW's DC universe.If you like comic book shows then this show will give you everything you want. A lot of easter eggs for the die hard comic fans, good special effects for a TV show. Nice pace of action/humor, and it doesn't change things to much from the comic. For fans of Arrow this show is a great spin off that tops the show it was spun from. It is not to dark and gritty and stays very light hearted so that it is something that young and old viewers can enjoy. Some shows get a little to violent or complex to where little kids that love comic characters cant enjoy, but this show is great fun for the whole family. ","10"
"The Flash",2014-11-04," The acting in this is painful to watch. The cast is horrible. Boring and unappealing. The plot and dialogue are just embarrassing. Who is watching this? I assume the same guys watching Arrow/Glee. It's seems to be written for very simple people with a certain expectation and that isn't talent. I can only hope this show ends up being canceled to make room for something worthwhile. I honestly have no idea how Berlanti is able to keep getting shows out. Perhaps it's just a lack of good idea's in TV right now so Berlanti is just in the right place at the right time. Seriously cringey show, as is Arrow. My advice is don't waste your time and intelligence watching this. Hopefully this only last one season. ","1"
"The Flash",2014-11-04," If you've watched the arrow you've seen this show - story, relationships, dialogue, the pretense of being a discourse in moral values while in truth being utterly superficial. It's the arrow with a geeky kid as the hero in place of the millionaire playboy.It's another addition to the trend of making shows where story doesn't matter, characterization doesn't matter, just another show rigidly following what the networks perceive to be a successful formula. why look for creative writing when you can just churn entertainment out on a factory line.Honestly, show's like this would be better if they didn't pretend to be something they're not - they wouldn't be good, but better. The preachiness is hilarious. ","5"
"The Flash",2014-11-03," The pilot of the show (episode 1) to be fair was good. And after watching episodes 2 - 4, unmasked the dummy that CW has sold us all. The casting is meeh (love Flash's crush - she's hot!), the effects are cool and that's where the positives end. The dialogue is mind-numbingly cliché, the plot is stupidly simple and it's an exact copy-paste of Arrow meets Smallville.Long story short, this is the stuff when you go to visit your girlfriend and she insists on watching it with you for you to get some after.Overall rating 3.5/10. Probably might rise to 4. ","3"
"The Flash",2014-11-03," Since the release of the trailer i have had high expectations for this series. Not only because Flash was my favorite among the Justice League but also because the special effects looked amazing.However, this show is not even close to living up to my expectations. Here are the things I do not like about the series:The script contains to many cliché dialogues. They make me cringe. Furthermore, Flash exhibits incredible speed all the time except when fighting villains. For example, in the episode, Going rogue, the villain is just a man with a freezing gun. Flash could easily decapitate him before he could even pull the trigger. However, he chooses not to and wait several seconds before trying to save other people. Most villains can be dealt with a gun. Usually Flash is not needed. ","5"
"The Flash",2014-11-01," Back in 1940 Gardner F .Fox created a unique superhero who was the fastest man alive after breathing in the fumes of Hard water for over a 12 hour period Jay Garrick discovered that he was the fastest man alive and decided to use these powers to help those in need. He called himself the Flash. With a WWI soldiers helmet on his head a red shirt with a lightening bolt on it he looked like Mercury. The Flash lasted in popularity until roughly 1952 when He and the rest of his team mates in the Justice Society of America made their last appearances. Afterwards the comics industry hit a massive slumpFlash Forward to 1956. The comics industry is in a slump. Nothing is selling well except for Superman Batman wonder woman Aquaman and Green Arrow. Aquaman and Green Arrow only survive because they are the back ups to superman and Batman. but still something needs to be done. Enter Julie Schwartz. Schwartz is a young editor at DC Comics and he is toying with a idea. To bring back the superheroes. He wants to revive the Flash but not Jay Garrick. He likes the idea of a fastest man alive doing impossible things . So he turns to Writer Robert Kanigher and Artist Carmine infantino. together in a weekend the three of them plot the origin story of the New Flash to be seen in DC Comics SHOWCASE PRESENTS. Showcase issue four hits the stands featuring the Flash and a new age begins the silver age of comics. The New Flash is police scientist Barry Allen who was struck by lightening while standing in front of a rack featuring every known chemical known to man. The lightening bolt strikes the chemicals and creates a reaction in Barry Allen it rewrites his DNA to give him incredible speed. The Flash was a Hit Barry Allen was a scientist and science featured a lot in the Flash stories. Now Flash forward to 1985 Barry Allen was killed during the Crisis on infinite Earths. And became DC's patron saint of noble heroes. During the early 90's a TV Show THE FLASH starred John Wesley Shipp as Barry Allen as the Flash and it did well. but it missed the boat in terms of characterization turning Barry Allen into a hip guy who worked hand in glove with Star LAbs and fought crime while sharing a love triangle with Two women. While the Shipp series was fun it wasn't the Flash ,Now DC is trying it again and pouring he Flash into the same mold as Green Arrow. While ARROW isn't Green Arrow from the comics it's a good solid show with great chracterizations. And a knack for telling a story. They borrowed the formula and poured the Flash into it making it almost a carbon copy of the Arrow. Grant Gustin's Barry Allen is young. Younger then Barry Allen originally was supposed to be. But he brings a freshness to it. And the fact is the show gives him a reason for being the Flash. Despite his being uncertain or his team in being uncertain. The first four episodes were highly enjoyable. And I look forward to seeing more of them. If they can keep up this pace they may truly have a winner here. Where Gotham and Arrow are gloomy and dark. The Flash is light and fun. And it's a good adventure show. Like I said if they keep the pace. And the invent full way of creating the Flash's famed rogues gallery. This will be a show to watch. ","10"
"The Flash",2014-11-01," The story, execution and the characters all seem to fit the situation. It's just too obvious. The man that small Barry saw when his mother was killed is none other than he 'HIMSELF'. He runs fast enough and travels time...goes in the time when his mom was killed and tries to save her but fails. I wont disclose what kills her. This part is similar to the story in Justice league:Flashpoint paradox. The Graphics is just too awesome. And the physics freaks will of-course love this. Worth a watch but is not worth the rating given here. A 7 is perfect. It may get interesting there are more episodes to come out. Well hope for the best. ","7"
"The Flash",2014-10-28," I've only seen one episode and it was good. The criticism is that it is not True Detective or The Wire. Well you are comparing premium cable's filet Mignon' to the WB's ground chuck. That standard disqualifies all other television as being anything other than trash because those are the high water mark for TV. This show does not aim to be poignant or transcendent. It's based on a comic book. It's supposed to give you some interesting villains, some cheap thrills and good special effects. You're here for some easy exciting escapism maybe while you're studying or doing something else. It accomplished this for me. The acting wasn't bad, the lead I would actually grade above average. The appeal of comic book super heroes is the classic and obvious battle of good vs evil. I like that they aren't trying to do too much. It wasn't awkwardly reaching for something profound. The comic book was not The Walking Dead. It was a clean cut hero story and this is what you are getting. ","7"
"The Flash",2014-10-28," As a fan of Arrow, I was interested in seeing how this show would play out. I have to say that DC is killin it with this show. They have learned from their mistakes with Arrow and improved on it with the flash. The writing is funny and witty. The acting is pretty great. The villains are all quite interesting. The man who plays Barry Allen is great. He's got just the right amount of corny and hes a funny guy. I love how this show doesn't take itself too seriously. Arrow did get a bit dark, especially with Season 2. This show is much more upbeat and carefree which is a nice change of pace. After a few episodes in, I can say that this show is off to a very good start, and if it keeps going this way, it's gonna be as good, if not better, than Arrow. ","10"
"The Flash",2014-10-27," I'm only on the third episode but man am I hooked! The effects are really on par for a series, especially one as effects heavy as this. I was really expecting some lame speed effects like in Smallville (which got better with age and budget), but they are really cool, especially in the First episode.I will say that when I say similar to Smallville, I mean as in the premise of the first season or so. Like monster of the week Buffy style.A massive shock wave of... erm stuff...(I forget) has affected the whole city like in Smallville how everyone and their dog (literally there is a super dog in that series) got affected by meteor rocks... or what you kids would call...  kryptonite . You kids with your touch screens and your hashtags... I'm getting off topic, it's cool, watch it. Not groundbreaking, but fun. ","9"
"The Flash",2014-10-27," If you like teenage-TV, you will like this.This series is childish both in acting and visuals. I would consider it somewhat like twillight and transformers. Some older kid is the hero, and there is no brutal reality included. The doctor, the engineer, the scientist, the journalist, almost all are just old kids no more than 22... Even the oh SOO evil villain is a kid, just with a false looking frown, black clothes and a leather jacket.The effects are high quality, like the previously mentioned films. Unfortunately this is not enough to save the show. The acting is goofy to say at least. IT is a typical hero, trying to make funny comments, fighting the bad guy, saving the girl.Three is nothing new or exciting in the show. Why it has gotten above 8 is a testament to peoples lack of taste. ","2"
"The Flash",2014-10-26," When I saw the pilot I was actually positively surprised how well they integrated the Flash on a TV setting that can't rely on big budget effects like they have in the movies and also the story was not too bad, however it went downhill from there. It's a lot like Smallville at the beginning, with a monster of the week setup and a small overall story arc. But the dialogs are just unimaginative and really corny, in fact so corny that I find myself cringing threw them or skipping these parts of the episode all together. I don't mind that they have this teeny stuff going on, since CW has to cater a bit to it's usual audience, but they always talk about the same thing and it's a lot worse than it ever was on Smallville or Arrow. Also they opened up too many small plot holes during the first few episodes so that I'm losing interest really fast. Too bad, it could have been a nice addition to the already great comic line-up on TV, but imo it's the weakest of all. ","4"
"The Flash",2014-10-26," I joined IMDb just to write this. I started to watch this series because my cable started showing it. I remembered The Flash series from my childhood and it was awesome! I used to skip my homework just to watch it because it was 1993 and we couldn't record it.Now I was excited to see the series once again but to my surprise this show is a total bullsh*t. Those fake acting, out of order scene cuts and inadequate story line (dialogues), it looks like someone is in a hurry to do this and get done with. There is no passion in this series, well technically at least and the CG effects are really really poor. I mean Indians are making better quality CG than this! No offense to anyone but this series does not deserves anything above 4.Thank you. ","2"
"The Flash",2014-10-26," I really wanted to like this latest attempt to portray DC Comics'  The Flash  character on the small screen. I grew up in the early 70's reading all the Barry Allen character's comics and he was my favourite of all the super heroes going around at the time. I also enjoy the show's progenitor  Arrow , itself based on another DC character, but like with the Oliver Queen character, the story here is changed to suit the demands of today's American TV audience.To be honest though, there never was much depth in the original comics anyway, Barry Allen was a blond, crew-cut 9-5, police scientist regular guy with a reporter girl friend (later his wife) Iris West, who fought a Rogues Gallery of costumed villains with his super-speed and super-vibratory powers. Here Iris West is changed into a young black girl and her absent-minded professor father in the comics to a right-on detective colleague of young Barry's who's got his back. Shades of Oliver Queen's troubled love-life from  Arrow  and of course there are parental issues too with the imprisonment of Barry's father for killing his mother likely to be the  Fugitive -type running plot throughout the series. There's also a back-up team to assist our hero, again just like in  Arrow . To be fair I've only seen the first episode but I think I know what I'm in for, namely, flashy (no pun intended), special effects and shallow characterisation. The young actor playing Barry Allen seems too callow for the part. The SFX are mixed, the blurring as Flash whizzes around town is fine but the close-ups of him on the run make him seem static. I like the costume as it doesn't deviate too much from the original and I liked the discreet nods to the DC universe with references to Grodd the super-ape and Ferris Airlines (Carol Ferris is Green Lantern's girl-friend in the comics), plus of course there's a mutual admiration hook-up with Stephen Amell's Arrow thrown in for good measure.My hope would be that they play up the super-villains aspect of the comics as well as developing Flash's powers beyond just running around fast all the time. I don't think I'll get it somehow as our boy gets sucked into a tug-of-war for Iris's affections and a drawn-out plot to free his dad. I'll keep watching though, I owe it to my teenage-self. ","5"
"The Flash",2014-10-24," Okay here's an analogy. Imagine getting a beautiful meal laid out in front of you and your just about to put your fork to the plate getting ready for a delicious bite of well-done steak, only for the manager of the restaurant to grab the cob from your plate and slam it down your throat causing you immense amounts of pain as you try to force yourself to remain cool and collected and not experience a  food -boy aneurysm.I guess the real question here is, Did you see the cob coming? Could you feel the consternation as your corny end neared? Of course you could, everyone could, it's just a matter of whether you'd let yourself believe it.I really wanted to come on here and rip to my damnedest about the corny nature of the flash, but that's just the idea of the show. It is corny, it is hammy, but it's all in good hope that the majority of superhero fans will see through the poor adaption as they see there favourite superhero hit the small screen. Face it people, it's not that good.I'm giving the show a 6 because I'm only 3 episodes in. I mean I wasn't a big fan of the first couple episodes of breaking bad, but as I got further and further into the show, I started to like it more and more until I couldn't wait to see the finale. I'll come back and change my rating if the show gets better. ","6"
"The Flash",2014-10-23," This wasn't a necessary spin off. This series could have been handled as recurring characters on 'Arrow'. The speeded up running around is monotonous. The cast looks like supporting cast. Grant Gustin is dorkishly charming but not leading man material. Candice Patton and him have no chemistry. Danielle Pannabaker looks a bit bored. This show lacks the A list (for TV) quality cast that 'Arrow' has. After a month it's just kind of lame more so than 'the Tomorrow People' which was canceled. The clear his father thing is so clichéd. Don't know why it's attracting such large viewer numbers. Can't see it lasting to a second season. ","3"
"The Flash",2014-10-11," To start with, The Flash was a pretty bad opening episode and if all following pistes are like this one, it will be a mockery of the great hero. You could get better acting talent from a school play and whoever was writing the dialogue shouldn't of been payed for what he delivered. The story showed all its card and was predictable. It didn't leave me wanting more, like it should have. i wasn't expecting some ground-breaking TV, but not this!!! However, one redeeming factor was the crime scene in the first 10-15 mins was quite good, with his thoughts being shown, but its far from original and can be seen in Fight Club. Hope it gets better - fast (pun intended). J ","3"
"The Flash",2014-10-11," I expected it to be a usual superhero show, but it was definitely different. The acting was well done, and Grant Gustin's humour reminds me of Andrew Garfield in the amazing spiderman. The flashback part of his mother dying was touching and Flash's meeting with his dad made us realize how deep the characters are. I liked it that it was not dark as dark and gritty is getting a bit mainstream nowadays. The show needs to be different and if it's funny it will stay good in the long run. Out of Gotham, Arrow, and Flash, I prefer Flash the most right now. The cast is perfect for the story and the arrow appearance was good. Overall it was super-awesome! ","10"
"The Flash",2014-10-11," I just watched the first episode and I must say that it really blew me. The effects and story were just WOW. (I can't see this being a spoiler as anyone who has seen the trailer or the Arrow episode would know this). I loved how it tied with the Arrow. I hope they do a few more episodes where the two heroes work together. I am not a massive DC fan but have read some of the comics in my time and followed all of the JLA episodes and DC animated movies and The Flash episode felt like what I remembered, it also links pretty well with The Flashpoint Paradox.For anyone saying they showed all card... I don't think so, it was a great pilot and gave enough information so that viewers who are not familiar with the DC universe would understand what was happening. For anyone that want to know more go and read up on the Crisis stories, the Speed Force and some of the more notorious villains such as Doctor Zoom:) ","10"
"The Flash",2014-10-10," I am just very disappointed. I think the ages of the characters really detracted from the general believability. I would have really preferred someone who looked more in their early thirties than someone... like they cast. This is just Flash Smallville. We have already done this before. If you liked Smallville and want Smallville only with The Flash... then sure. But if you were looking for something new and fresh, then this will be tired.I really preferred the Barry Allen who played him in the 1990 series that was canceled well before it should have... But I guess it was nice seeing him as his dad... It just... ug.I really felt that if it wasn't for the amazing special effects, there would be nothing holding this series at all. ","5"
"The Flash",2014-10-10," Grant Gustin stars as Barry Allen, a crime scene technician for the Police Department who at 12 witnessed the murder of his mother for which his father is in jail for. After a freak accident his metabolism has developed in such way that he can run incredibly fast and with the help of local scientists he has decided to use his new found powers to help people.I'm definitely not an Arrow fan, nevertheless I thought of giving this show a chance, as someone who's not that familiar with Flash I thought it'd be interesting to watch, but had mixed feelings because of CW's reputation to cater to young teens. Boy, was I wrong.I find this show to be amazing, well written, well paced, lovable characters, humorous, hearted, full of sentiments without the obligatory soapy drama.Barry, Cisco, Catlin and the rest of the cast make an amazing show. Besides, I like Jesse L Martin, I saw every season of L&O and I think he is a nice addition to the show. Only time will tell but they're off to an okay start. ","9"
"The Flash",2014-10-10," I watched the pilot episode, it's not that bad has far as comic book shows go. Grant Gustin has the main lead is affective in the role, not to mention he looks like Andrew Garfield's kid brother. The writers made him pretty likable and someone for the audience to identify with.The effects are pretty well done, and the hero's outfit looks pretty satisfying, almost similar to Daredevil(2003). The rest of the cast are memorable also. I really don't mind a new retelling of the fastest DC superhero, but in some parts I can't help but feel they where turning The Flash into another Batman, but has the series goes I hope they come up with clever story lines, Has for 1990 version of The Flash, feeling like they didn't know exactly where to go with that one.But I hope this show will go in many places, and there is a twist en voling a certain character.

"The Flash",2014-10-09," The Flash is one of the best superheroes ever, as a kid I always regretted he had not enough pages on DC Comics: maybe his red costume or his simple superpower but there is something inspiring in him.I just watched the first episode of the new TV series and I liked it very much: characters were cool (Harrison Wells' crew above all) and plot was catching. Special effects were OK too (car crushes were surprisingly good) and I know I'm hooked.And oh, by the way, I know Sarah Connors is right: Internet will take the lead and we will have to fight for our lives against Terminators. But for the time being you can live anywhere in the world and watch American TV series. And that's cool too! ","10"
"The Flash",2014-10-08," I am big DC comics book fan. I love the Flash, and I am very happy he finally got his own TV show. I hope he gets a movie soon. The TV show pilot episode was amazing! This is a great adaptation of DC comics Barry Allen. The show has a great story, music, characters, humor, everything about it is enjoyable. I am very excited for the show. I hope it stays on for a while, this is the type of TV I want to watch. Smallville was my favorite TV show, and now besides Arrow, I have found a new replacement for Smallville. Even though it is still early I am very excited for the flash. It has potential of being amazing show, and it was cool how they put John Wesley Shipp (the original TV flash) as Barry's father. CW is doing great work with arrow and now flash, just plain awesome. 10/10 Run Barry Run! ","10"
"The Flash",2014-10-08," It looks as though this is going to work well. The pilot was enjoyable and has scope for development.But before the purists start shaking their heads and muttering. THIS ISN'T the comic. It does have some differences from the earlier TV rendition and the comic book. If it was the same and had actors that looked/ sounded the same as before or were identical to them what would be the point in watching it ? It's a TV series of a comic book character and it has (so far) been done credibly and solidly. It has taken the basic premise and used it. The characters need some fleshing out and the actors need to grow into their skins. Hopefully the story lines will improve as the series grows.Watch it with an open mind. It will be worth it if the pilot is anything to go by. ","8"
"The Flash",2014-10-08," The CW's latest superhero series is THE FLASH, based on the long running DC comic; the character of Barry Allen, a forensic investigator, was given a try out on THE ARROW last season, so fans got a sneak peak and knew what the expect. This was one of the few new shows this season that I was actually looking forward to seeing, and it did deliver on its promise. Unlike GOTHAM, over on FOX, it didn't try to pack too much into the first episode. The thing I liked most about the show was that it had a hero who actually seemed to get a kick out of having super powers and enjoyed thwarting the bad guy. Barry Allen's The Flash is a good contrast to Oliver Queen's the Arrow (who has a nice cameo) who is all grim determination over in Star City. In casting Grant Gustin, they made Barry a lot younger than he was in the comic books, but what did anyone expect from The CW; the mysterious death of his mother and the unjust imprisonment of Barry's father is the Big Dark in this Flash's past, but it does not consume him the way it does for some other super heroes (talking about you Batman).The other good thing about THE FLASH is how the creators are trying to work the larger DC universe into it, with it gallery of Meta Humans and Super Villains. The explosion at STAR Labs, which gave Barry his super speed, has released alien energies into Central City and presumably the wider world, and though the laboratory mishap is an old comic book trope, it still gets the job done when it comes to creating plot possibilities. In the pilot we saw Barry take on The Weather Wizard, and the previews gave us a glimpse of Wentworth Miller's Leonard Snart aka Captain Cold. This season also promises appearances by Heatwave, Firestorm, General Eiling, and a return of THE ARROW'S Clock King, played the superb Robert Knepper.There is a good supporting cast headed by Jessie Martin as Detective West, whose daughter Candace Patton is the love interest; true fans will remember John Wesley Shipp, who plays Barry's incarcerated father, as playing The Flash in a short lived 1990 TV show. Tom Kavanagh is Harrison Wells, the head of STAR Labs and Barry's benefactor, but in what has become a cliché for these kind of shows, is revealed in the final scene to be not the man he appears to be (maybe ZOOM, the reverse Flash). The CGI was pretty good for this kind of show; the fans standards are pretty high these days, especially after seeing Quicksilver in X- MEN:DAYS OF FUTURE PAST.I first encountered The Flash long ago in a great cartoon on Saturday morning, and I still think animation is the best way to do super heroes, but this live action Flash is a good effort. And while we're on the subject, will someone please bring back Saturday morning cartoons. ","8"
"The Flash",2014-10-08," Are we getting dumber as an audience? Since plots and narratives are getting more simple and obvious in the Hollywood realm. The Flash shows all its cards straight away. Good guy vs bad guy, a pretty girl that will probably need saving, epic end-boss, obvious love-story. Characters literally explain their motives, almost while looking at the audience through the camera. Don't know what a particle accelerator is? Here let me write it down on a chalk board!Legendary series like The Wire, Sopranos, True Detective, and more, feature enticing narratives, pushed forth by symbols, layers of meaning , human complexities and engaging acting. They are OK with keeping some mystery and tell multiple narratives in multiple manners. They push the viewer to think, anticipate and take him or her seriously. ","5"
"The Flash",2014-10-08," Watching The Flash's Pilot made me want to write my first review ever.As of how this series maintains a 9.0/10 avg rating from 2084 users is something I can only understand if all of its cast and their close relatives have been voting for it!!!First of all let me say that I'm not a comic book fan but I enjoy the way comic book Super Heroes are depicted in today's Series, Movies, etc... I found The Flash really annoying to follow. My main issue would be how fast the first episode/pilot is paced as it feels like the story jumps from one scene to another without any continuity or reason and way, way, way too fast, just as if they were trying to give the audience way too much information fitting way too many scenes in the first 45 minutes. The dialogs are a little bit forced, as they normally are in Comic Books, but in a TV series scenario they feel way too unreal given some situations.On the plus side, the cgi effects are well executed and the acting is quite up to par. It feels as it has a decent cast choice (I guess all the bad actors were hired for Gotham).I will be giving The Flash a second chance once they release the next episode, but should it fail to improve I doubt I will waste my time on a third episode.CO ","4"
"The Flash",2014-10-08," So finally it's here. After swearing not to follow another CW cheap series after Supernatural ends, which hasn't happened, I found myself catching up with two seasons of Arrow in a matter of days after ignoring it for 2 years, just because a friend told me that Flash is featured in it and there'll be a stand-alone show for him. I had been waiting for something for Flash for years, with its exciting ideas and possibilities, and now, the first episode didn't disappoint.The show appears to be following some standard superhero and CW routines, which is frustrating and annoying sometimes, but also can be done well. It's at its worst when it gets into relationships and characters we couldn't care less, and at its best when...you guessed it, when it strikes you with the actions. Some over-familiar elements have to be addressed here. Anyone who has seen one episode of Smallville can tell the unmistakable similarity between their pilots, namely the big idea that create our one-episode super-powered freaks. Only what used to be a Kryptonite meteor-storm becomes an unknown energy breakout in the city. Then there's the  my dream girl's dad is a cop and he wants his daughter out of it so I'm filled with guilt  formula that has been used just way too many times in recent years. From the Amazing Spider-Man series to Flash's sister show, Arrow. Seriously CW? You guys really that short on scripts?Speaking of Arrow, Oliver's guest appearance is most welcome here, even though he didn't really do anything. It gave me some expectations in his coming 3rd season. But to be honest, I usually have to fast- forward some Arrow sequences that involve his girlfriend Laurel or his sister. Green Arrow is a very limited hero, so a large part of the show has to be focused on relationships and character development, which usually in CW shows range from mediocre to downright unwatchable. The Flash, on the other hand, although share some of those problems, does promise a kick-ass action that wakes me up instantly. It's not of movie standards of course, but it's satisfactory enough it made me say  so that's where my Supernatural budget went. So where does it stand among the many superhero-themed shows today? It's still hard to tell because it's only the pilot, but for now I would place it above Arrow and Agents of Shield. Gotham? It's also a new show and it looks promising, we'll just see. ","8"
"The Flash",2014-10-08," Despite the fact that it is a reboot of the 1990 series that starred john Wesley snipp who played Barry Allen ends up playing Barry's father and the title role is now played by grant gustin and does a rather splendid job playing the role. The story deals with Barry who is trying to find out who was the one responsible for his mothers murder and finding out who framed his father. What I like about Barry despite the fact that he starts out as a geeky and socially awkward that you wouldn't expect to be a superhero but when a thunderstorm causes the particular accelerator to explode thus putting Barry in a coma for nine months and giving him his super speed. What Barry finds out that he is not the only superhuman with abilities. While the show is lighter in toned than arrow but the show is still enjoyable. ","8"
"The Flash",2014-10-07," I saw the pilot episode tonight with my sister and we can both agree this blew our expectations out of the water. This is coming from polar opposites; a comic buff and a casual just trying to catch a decent show after work. The effects were movie-esque, stunning for a TV-show especially when compared to its predecessors(Smallville's Flash 10 years ago as well as the 90s Flash TV series 25 years ago). The acting is fantastic and on point. Gustin, although he doesn't look the part, is an incredibly charming Barry Allen. The support cast is great, for the most part.Won't go into too much detail, but what won me over was the honesty to the comics while all the same adding in original characters and plot so that it leaves long-time fans surprised as well. The back story and power origins are near exactly how it was in the source material(the comics), CW did not streamline it to make it  more realistic  or  less cheesy . The first episode reveals that they will not limit Barry's abilities. Where Arrow will be their more realistic street-crime TV series, the Flash will have him up against his super-powered comic villains. This may not seem that important to the average viewer, but I'm in tears of joy to see an awesome character done right.Plot: 10/10 Acting/Casting: 9/10 Atmosphere: 10/10Final score: 9.66, repeating of course ","10"
"The Flash",2014-10-07," As a big fan of super hero movies and television, I was very much looking forward to the first episode of the Flash. Particularly given Arrow is one of my favourite shows, and this new version is a spin off, or at least heavily connected to that series.As with Arrow, many of the elements and characteristics of the original comic book hero have been kept, although many are also adapted or even ignored to appeal to a more modern and mainstream audience.As with the original comic book character Barry Allen (Grant Gustin), is a police scientist, or CSI investigator in this case, who is still a highly moral individual despite his history and profession. This was an important aspect of the character that had to be kept as it was central to who he was. In Justice #8 (2006), Batman says,  Barry is the kind of man that I would've hoped to become if my parents hadn't been murdered.  Like the original character Allen is also always late, however unlike the original Barry Allen this version is much younger, and is not married. He does however still reside in Central City.Of course viewers of Arrow will already be somewhat familiar with this version of Barry Allen, as he was introduced to audiences in the second half of season two of that show. This was a good move by the producers, as it creates an existing connection between the character and the audience before the new show actually airs.The series starts with a flashback from Allen's past when his mother was apparently killed by some strange (electrical?) phenomenon. His father was jailed for the murder and remains in prison, although Barry believes him to be innocent and has been investigating the death on his own for many years. No doubt, this investigation will be a continuing theme throughout the series, or at least the early seasons.The circumstances that transform Barry Allen into the Flash are again similar to the original comic book in that he is struck by lightning and doused by a mixture of chemicals. Although in this version a particle accelerator built by Star Labs triggered the storm when it blew up after being turned on for the first time. I suspect this too will play a major part further down the track.Particularly given Allen awakes from a nine month coma in Star Labs (or at least what was left of it after the explosion), and that is where he discovers his new powers, and also how to use and control them. Star Labs and its owner Harrison Wells (Tom Cavanagh), also supply Allen with his suit. But is Wells helping Allen for purely altruistic reasons, or has he another agenda that will reveal itself it coming episodes? Jesse L. Martin (Law and Order), plays Detective Joe West who helped raise Barry after his father was sent to prison and works alongside him. His daughter Iris West (Candice Patton), who of course was Allen's wife in the comic book, is more like a sister in this series, although Allen wishes for more.While it had its faults I really enjoyed the first episode of the Flash, and look forward to seeing the direction the show will take. The production values were high, which is to be expected as DC and Warner Bros. are behind the series, so the special effects were also of high quality. The acting was solid, and the script while not providing anything really new, did allow for some intriguing possibilities in the future.If you're a fan of super hero shows, and in particular Arrow, I highly recommend giving this series a go. While at this early stage I would not wish to compare the two, one thing that is obvious is the Flash will not be as dark as Arrow. Whether that's a good thing or not, is entirely up to you. 7/10 ","7"
"The Flash",2014-10-07," Yes, I know, the fanboys are not going to be happy with this review because most of them live in an alternate universe where ANY comic (graphic novel) that makes it to TV is automatically an object of worship about which nothing unkind can be said.But the pilot, the  origins  if you prefer, was way below what it should be.Here is the thing. I grew up with the DC world, in real time (the 60s), I have seen every theatrical release of a comic hero ever done, and on this database I am (egad) a  top reviewer.  So said, and acknowledging the decades-old battle between DC and Marvel for comic supremacy, I was happily surprised when DC endowed Arrow with rich quirky characterizations and great dialog, elevating it to fair competition for AGENTS OF SHIELD. (The latter has the Whedon brothers behind it, the real  superheroes  of TV writing) I had high expectations for FLASH and not one was met. When I see that tiny grimace on the face of Grant Gustin, I do not see a superhero trying to adjust to his powers, I see an actor trying to adjust to his character. Big difference.The supporting roles in the pilot seem weakly drawn, and the pep talk from Stephen Amell should have come with a warning for diabetics.Sure, this series will find its sealegs over time and the fanboys will forgive almost everything, but the fact remains, a weak start.

"The Flash",2014-10-07," I absolutely loved this pilot!! As a comic book fan myself I don't mind the few changes as it makes it more modern.It always is going to seem cheesy because it is a comic book show. You cant have everything perfect. Also I love how they added some of theistic from the Toby Maguire Spider-Man as well nice touch! So looking forward to more of this show. I also enjoyed the costume change as well. That definitely needed an upgrade. I also really appreciated the meeting between Flash and Arrow. Otherwise it wouldn't have made sense as they do live in the same universe. I would go on but all I can say is the show has potential to be one of the best TV shows running right now!! ","10"
"The Flash",2014-10-07," This show had an amazing pilot that never made me tire of action or story. The story is fairly done and though DC is taking its movies down a grittier line, we still have Arrow (our Emerald Crusader/Dark Knight) and we have Flash (our Crimson Speedster/Man of Steel), however Barry isn't invincible, and this show brings out the truth of becoming a superhero with powers. Flash shows us the hopeful side of DC as well as bringing that hope into the every week's heart of fans. Side Note: In light of the huge rave Batman V. Superman is getting, we get to enjoy (Flash and Arrow episode 8) CW's Batman V Superman before Warner Bro's Batman V. Superman XD. This show shows extremely high potential and is living up to the expectations set up by its great liner-backs (Arrow, Man of Steel, The Dark Knight Trilogy, etc..) 10/10 ","10"
"The Flash",2014-10-07," I finally have found a show to replace Smallville. It has the right amount of action with good actors and solid story lines. Love the heroes and villains. I love that they added Tom Caughlin to the cast. Not sure how I like the leading lady but the girl who plays Caitlin is a sure thing. I loved her in Sky High. A must add to your Tuesday night lineup.I was disappointed with Arrow. I was hoping they would have brought in the actor from Smallville and I hate the leading women in the show. She can NOT act. At least the characters are likable and believable. The young kid who Plays Barry/Flash is perfect like Tom Welling as Clark/Superman. I also am happy that they explained a lot in the first episode.
