"Arrow",2017-11-10," This show is ridiculous and unconvincing. Dialogues are awful, acting is bad and the script is insulting viewer's intelligence. Mother's secrets could have been a great show for itself and are, along with the island flashbacks the only reason I'm still watching. The bad guys and villains aren't scary at all, action scenes aren't exciting, some of the actors have a charisma of a cooked octopus when they're trying to be tough; that's actually funny from time to time. Absolutely the worst part are the relations between characters driven by kindergarten dialogues which are embarrassing to watch and listen. ","1"
"Arrow",2017-11-10," This was one of the best TV shows you watch for comic book genre, It started of great well lit up scenes with loads of action, suspense and a good story-line, suddenly all of that was thrown out and made a weak series in which the main character reveals himself all the time and the action is terrible to watch, no suspense, no general direction of the character, in almost every episode its the same dialogue  Oliver if you want them to trust you, you should let them know who you are, and Oliver takes of his eye piece and says  I am the Green Arrow  L.O.L What Dafuq.The show is just going down hill, specially that now the main character is now Felicity (sleeps with all the Billionaires and take their fortune and keeps them under her payroll) worst character, Thea Queen 2nd billionaire famous line  I am out . Just keep the group small and the action hardcore like 1st season, identity reveal yeah stop that, let the character start killing again, and please don't bring dead people back to make their own show.Season 1 - Great. Season 2 - Just OK. Season 3 - What is happening.Season 4 - Why are you killing the show. Season 5 - I give up, cant watch anymore. Season 6 - Stopped watching. ","7"
"Arrow",2017-11-07," The action of Arrow is awesome! but i feel that it has become a little boring because there is absolutely no humor, Felicity talks too much, and many other flaws. Thats why i give it a 4/10 rating. Otherwise, the series' action is perfect.#Flashfan ","4"
"Arrow",2017-11-03," This show is amazing and it gets better each day . Season 6 is spectacular. This is the best DCTV show in the Arrowverse. The show matures and grows each year . The leads of the show are spectacular and their chemistry is legendary . Great cast . Great story. Got a hold of this show last year and if I had blindly followed the haters remarks online, I would not have tried to check it out on my own . Guess what ? The show is amazing !! ","10"
"Arrow",2017-10-27," I really loved this show at first but its become very hit and miss as to weather an episode is any good or not. It started out great (8/10) it was kinda dark and ruthless but unfortunately the writers started emphasizing on the characters feelings way too much. Also the fight scenes although slightly better now became super cheesy and felt like I was watching power rangers around season 4.I really hope that they start focusing more on the villains and plot more again. Also it definitely wouldn't bother me if they killed off most of the annoying cast members. ","6"
"Arrow",2017-10-27," The First Season Of Arrow is a Great Season, it doesn't even feel like a superhero show (in a good way) the action scenes and flash backs are great and look like a scene from Mission Impossible or Kingsmen! The villain is top notch, the emotion is there, absolute greatness. Sure, it stalls here and there but that's expected when you have to fill 23 hours. the first season is great 8.75/10 IMOThe second is best so far, Deathstroke is the best villain, other than him the villain of the week's are also great e.g. the doll maker and clock king. the flash backs are also the greatest 9.5/10 IMOthe third season is where things go downhill, till the mid season it was shaping up to be great but after  The Climb  It became really mediocre, Ra's AL ghoul was an okay villain and the finale was really anti climatic. 6/10 IMOThe fourth is the worst. there is realistic feel to it, Damien Dahrk is a magician while Oliver is only an archer/hand to hand fighter. Thus the stakes are raised too high also Schism is the second worst episode ever. 5/10 IMOThe fifth season is a revival and is the second best season, Prometheus is a phenomenal villain and the stakes have been taken down a notch (THANK GOD) the finale is the best episode ever of Arrow, the only bad episode was  Underneath  and its quite possibly the WORST EPISODE TOO. 9/10 IMOoverall you will have a blast with the first two seasons, will have to sit through the bore that is season 3 and 4 and will be hooked at season 5, HIGH HOPES FOR SEASON 6 ","8"
"Arrow",2017-10-21," Like with Smallville and The Flash I have not seen every single episode but on some occasions, I do watch this show but only when there is a crossover or a certain actor in a particular episode. Like Peter Stormare who did good acting as Count Vertigo for two episodes and Matt Ryan who was John Constantine for one episode which was very funny. I also think Stephen Amell did great as Green Arrow and Felicity Smoke is pretty hot like Cathlin Snow from The Flash is. It is an okay show but it is not as interesting or likable as The Flash or Smallville. ","6"
"Arrow",2017-10-17," Every year Arrow is becoming more boring . 1st and 2nd Season of Arrow is very interesting great Story. But is seems after 2nd Season their are lack in Story Writing. Same old type of Stories Nothing new and interesting .As a fan of Arrow I am very disappointed and i expect more from Arrow. ","5"
"Arrow",2017-10-10," The first 2 seasons of the show was amazing however after that it got stale and boring. I decided to give up less than half way through season 5. The flashbacks become uninteresting. The villains after 2 seasons are boring. Love story is soap opera material. Season 4 made the show unrealistic with the sci-fi magic. Arrow was more interesting when he was working alone without any sidekicks. ","5"
"Arrow",2017-10-04," The first two seasons of Arrow were brilliantly done. The cinematography was illuminating, and it had a good plot. Somewhere along the line, though, the writing went south, and I know where we can point a finger to: Marc Guggenheim. It's bad enough that he killed off Laurel, but apparently, he wants another to take up the mantle. Rather than giving it to her Earth 2 counterpart, like any ordinary writer does, he gives it to a character named Tina Boland, whose real name is apparently Dinah Drake. Never mind that the real Dinah actually appeared before, and that she was Laurel's mother! I swear, I don't know how in the world these writers are able to find jobs. They suck at it. Then there's the Felicity relationship. Not a bad character, but when you focus on shipping these two together, when clearly, within the comic books, Green Arrow and Black Canary are an item from day one! And she constantly makes some of the most bone headed plays, yet Oliver never calls her out for it. He's such a wuss. He's not Green Arrow. Green Arrow is funny, witty and doesn't mope around. Stephen Amell is a good actor, but they should have stopped the whole Batman persona around Season Two or Three. They had a chance to make things right with Season Four, yet they come away from that one even worse. And they didn't even know who was going to end up in the grave. Really? You threw the grave plot line out there, without knowing WHO was going to end up in it? To this day, I still say William, Oliver's son, should have been the one who died. This would have made his fight against Damien Darhk much more personal. In fact, who wouldn't have wanted him to die? John Barrowman is a good actor, but they've lost all use for him. Oliver's excuses for letting him live fall flat when he sold out his son in exchange for protection. To me, that's unforgivable. I'm sorry, writers, but you have failed this show. If you want to keep me interested, fire the show-runners. Better yet, cancel the show, before you make things much worse. ","7"
"Arrow",2017-09-29," From the first season I thought that this show was unique and had a lot of promise; it was full of intrigue and frustrating characters who seemed to be neither good or bad in a way contrasting to so many superhero films/series. To say how much I enjoyed the show in the first and second seasons I was thoroughly disappointed from there in and yet I stuck around for two more seasons. The worst things about the show was how repetitive the villains became and how easily supposedly dead cast members were somehow brought back to life. I just wish this show had finished at it's peak after season two! ","6"
"Arrow",2017-08-11," I used to think Arrow was a great show until the first episode of season 3,that was when the show went downhill in my opinion.I first like seeing a dark version of the popular archer Green Arrow from DC Comics and seeing popular characters that were supporting characters of Green Arrow come to life in the Green Arrow's own dark story which seemed pretty interesting for the first two seasons.But when the show had it's season 3 premiere and it introduced Ra's al Ghul and more stories similar to other Batman stories started to be on the show,that's when the Green Arrow of the cw started to feel more like a parody and Felicity,his main love interest on The CW started to feel like her getting paralyzed and being named Overwatch was stolen from the story of how Batgirl/Barbara Gordon got paralyzed and got the nickname Oracle and fell in love with Batman.And I still can't believe the writers didn't mind killing of the Black Canary in season 4,who is the real main love interest of the Green Arrow and not Felicity Smoak. ","1"
"Arrow",2017-08-11," The action scenes are excellent and the story line if you are fan of super heroes in comics but the relationships between them are like the bold and the beautiful!like an American or Turkish soap opera!!!so beautiful faces with so boring personalities!!laurel??pffffff so predictable and flat as a woman!only felicity keeps the level up OK it is not game of thrones to have complexity in the characters but why so flat feelings?? P.S are we serious???im in season 2 and it's getting worse the romance part is awful soryyyy I mean stupid!!are the comics like this???mr director please this is not a soap opera!! PS2 at the end season 2 was much better and the love story between felicity and arrow seems the only real one!i hope to continue like this!!manu Bennett great performance as in Spartacus,he is a great actor he made season 2 more interesting PS 3 I quit watching at season 4...it could be a good show but unfortunately the script and the production are poor and in the soap opera's level...that's why I lowered my review to 4/10 What a pity :( ","4"
"Arrow",2017-07-27," I love superhero movies...I mean love em...I love Marvel and DC movies I do not have a favorite between the two I just love em both. I haven't read any comic books so I have to research origin stories and stuff. With that being said..The TV shows are a very different, which is to be expected. I still like some of em very much. Well I can safely say I really like the Flash. It is expected that superheros shows are cheesy I mean come on...sometimes the cheese on top makes it better. With that being said Arrow is to cheesy for me...I binge watch every show I watch and I watch a lot of shows (quite a range of em). The Flash, and Arrow do a lot of crossovers that is why I began watching Arrow so that I could follow that story line because of the cross overs. I am in to the 5th season and I just don't think I can I watch another a season. I will get through this one but my God! It is like the characters aren't growing at all. 5 yrs in to the season and Oliver is still the same whining, brooding woe is me character he was in season 1. How can he be so pathetic and at the same time be so cocky to think every thing that happens in the universe is some how his doing? Who is he GOD? The constant self torment, it is like be the Arrow or don't already! Kill or stop. At the same time every freaking season Thea has to go find herself. She loses sight of who she really is every season, come on. Who is writing this crap? Can she please find herself and be good? It has been 5 years what is going on? Of course there are the canaries. Can they just die or freaking live already? It is sooo ridiculous the same story written every season.The betrayals. How many times can Oliver MCQueen get betrayed by someone he trust before he learns to stop being an idiot? He is supposed to be the mayor and the Green Arrow protecting the city on two different fronts yet he is constantly trusting anyone who comes into his life and being played. Come on. A person has to have better instincts than that to run a city or be a super hero! This season with this new team!This new team is awful. I mean awful. There is literally 0 purpose for any of them to be with Oliver. They can't fight, they don't have any powers, their instincts suck. The only one that could do anything was the one with the suit that had power. Mr. Wonderful or whatever is good at tech stuff but who needs him when they have Felicity, except he is also good at being a punching bag. The Jason Voorhies want be is a terrible substitution for that other guy they had that Thea was dating (I am terrible at remembering names).I have started this season so I have to finish, but right now it is killing me. Every scene, and every episode so far is just so dumb. ","3"
"Arrow",2017-07-21," Arrow piloted in 2012. I loved the first season. Oliver Queen returns from his island he was stranded on and decides to fight crime because of his father and to make Star City better so he becomes the vigilante known as the Green Arrow. The first season was amazing and had a great plot. Stephen Amell had quality acting and the actors for Felicity, Diggle, and Laurel are all good. So I thought it wasn't going to get better. It got better. Season 2 was much darker and was highlighted by a new villain. It contained more quality acting and more Oliver flashback scenes. So after that I loved Arrow. But it didn't last. Season 3 wasn't necessarily terrible but it lost something about the first 2 seasons that made it great. It had a different vibe and it just didn't have a great plot. Season 4 gets too supernatural and season 4 is a low point for the series and I didn't enjoy it that much. I reluctantly watched season 5 which initially isn't great but by the end it recovers from season 4s problems. I would recommend this show but it's not perfect. It does have some weaknesses but it's a good show at its best ","8"
"Arrow",2017-07-21," I have watched four seasons, and this show has gone from great to fantastic! First of, I am not very familiar with the comic, but I have done some reading up post watching. The first season has a lot of introductions, explaining and character growth. The second and third season expands on this and while the good parts becomes better, the not so good parts starts to show more. Some say there is too much drama in the show, I say yes, there is drama, bu that makes the characters, motifs and bonds that much stronger any you get a real sense of what they are fighting for. By the end of the third season I felt like I was feed too much of an excellent meal, and really hoped there would be some changes until season four. I really got what I wished for! Oliver Queen finally starts to smile a lot more and leaves his previously troubled self behind. The chemistry between the characters is almost touchable and the fight scenes are simply amazing. Just watch episode 6 of season 4 for a great example. This particular shot just goes on and on without any cut. Simply breathtaking!Arrow is heavily tied to the Flash series so it is almost mandatory to watch them side by side in the right order. I personally don't mind this as I love Flash also. ","9"
"Arrow",2017-07-06," Arrow is just the show, you'd watch, when you are bored to death. Aside from that, this has the best background story, you'll ever experience from a life series. On the other hand, it gets milked by the present to an extent, where it just gets boring.Judging by the book, the Author really made a poor job. The setting, acting and everything else was just so there was a barely standing hero-series. => Normal guy becomes hero, kills and arrests bad people and has all the women he wants.=> Bad people wanna kill him and the women, he looses the women. => Hero stops them. => Hero becomes hyped, kills and arrests more bad people and has all the women he wants.Looping all the way to the end of the series.This kind of reminds me of Superman mixed with Robin Hood and Batman.Sure, there are some parts where I laughed and really got hyped by the next episode, but comparing to others, these moments were minor in arrow. As the 3rd Season started, I suddenly felt, why this series has such a bad reputation. Everything went viral, to complete confusion. The impression I got, worsened and kept its pace.For everyone considering watching a mainstream Hero-Vigilante-RobinHood-Richguy-Series. Why not just watch arrow? Considering that: I dare you to watch past season 2. ","8"
"Arrow",2017-07-03," If you're lucky you have yet to watch this horrible show. There is so much wrong with this show that I'm actually having trouble thinking of how/if I will present all the issues.First off, even if this show was well written (which it most certainly isn't) it wouldn't show up on screen due to the human statues that are delivering the dialogue. Stephen Amell is an absolute board. Sure, he's good looking but come on CW, he's terrible! It's as if the casting directors went to the nearest Abercrombie and Fitch photo shoot and chose the best looking guy to be their lead! Secondly, am I the only one who thinks that characters must have strong motivation to change? If characters make huge decisions as a result of small events those decisions are seen as cheap and meaningless. This show is the cheapest of them all.My third and final complaint (that I will list) is please stop recycling lines, it's gut churning.Unless you like poking fun at terrible shows don't go near this one. ","1"
"Arrow",2017-06-28," Arrow is certainly the best DC superhero TV show along with Gotham. Features DC characters such as Green Arrow, Deathstroke (the best of the lot), Black canary and Felicity Smoak!! The reason why Arrow is better than many other shows such as Iron Fist is because of the whole flashback and present thing that goes on... the way in which the show is made is unique and that's the best part about the show!!The 1st season is watchable but then the 2nd season arrives which is amazingly awesome just because of a single character and that is none other than Deathstroke!!Watch this one... it's amazing!! ","10"
"Arrow",2017-06-22," It was pretty alright at first, but is now a crappy show, with lame plots, and lot of boring and annoying characters. The fight scenes were alright at first, but they're trying to look cooler with no avail, with unnecessary spins and stuff, the action scenes are rubbish and hilarious, with awful choreography. ","1"
"Arrow",2017-06-22," Arrow may be the worst superhero show on T.V. Season 1 & 2 were good but after that it went down hill. The writing is terrible and the acting is worst. Everyone on the show is melodramatic. Everyone is so serious all the time. The writers constantly write the story into a corner and us The easy way out to fix the situation. Eventually everything become meaningless bc u know they will just take the easy way out. Ex: Magic pill , futuristic technology, dream sequel, secret twin and clones..etc. Plus the felicity can hack into literally anything in the world. She might actually be the strongest superhero in the show.One of the main characters was shot and supposedly was  permanently  paralyzed then in like three episodes the character gets a magic chip or something installed in their spine to magically heal themselves. One fake out is okay but the show only consists of fake outs. To the point that it becames predictable. Nobody ever dies except the fact that they have fake killed off every character on the show. Every arrow episode ever : actor 1 : I can't trust you. If u go ahead with your plan we can't be friends anymore. Actor 2: I have to. By the end of the episode problem is resolved and the gang is back together. Rinse and repeat ","2"
"Arrow",2017-06-21," I really enjoyed watching season 1. The story line had a purpose, I wanted to know how he survived and so on. The ending of season 1 was also great, but after that it just felt the story lost its momentum. Season 2 started with really nothing, everything sort of had to restart, and for me it couldn't. The nail in the coffin was when Sara Lance showed up apparently surviving the boat accident as well. Even though they showed the situation when she was lost at sea. After that it just fell apart for me and I could not watch a single episode. ","5"
"Arrow",2017-06-14," MAY CONTAIN SPOILERS Wow... Just plain bad... Green Arrow is the worst super hero (it pains me to write super) ever portrayed on screen... movie or TV.. yeah even worse than daredevil the movie and catwoman with Halley Berry... THINK ABOUT THAT FOR A SECOND!This show fails across the board... directing, acting, writing... But the biggest failure is demographic.. show is too stupid and cliché for adults but too serious for kids... Main protagonist is just a regular guy... like really nothing special about him (except banging everything that moves and abbbbsss), he cant even fight.. AT ALL... he gets his ass kicked in almost every episode by regular guys not to mention elderly.. And the message it send to younger audience is plain wrong... Its OK to harbor mass murderer as long as they are family??? What? Female protagonists are portrayed like emotion driven morons who cant think or do anything by themselves... Like every female protagonist cry at least twice per episode, there is less crying in soap operas... Ohh and the cringe worthy  drama  is the pinnacle of bad writing... This review box doesen't support enough words for me to explain everything that is bad with this show!I would not recommend this show for people with brains! (sry for my bad English its my 2nd language) ","1"
"Arrow",2017-06-13," I really liked this show up till the 3rd season. Then it seems it got infected with the SJW bug. Same goes for The Flash and Legends of Tomorrow Every episode has some cultural marxist spin to it. They had an episode about gun controlled that was so flawed it sounded like a twelve year old wrote it. They didn't think people should be allowed to by an AR-15. At the same time he has dozens of M-4's in his secret layer and two of the heroes go around shooting people every episode. The idea that the criminal mafia's and gangs would stop using guns if they were illegal is just one example of why they need to fire the writers. There is numerous episodes in which the women make sexist comments towards men. Of course the men just have to apologize for being born male. SJW's have destroyed movies, video games, and TV shows. There needs to be a great purge in the media and entertainment industries. ","1"
"Arrow",2017-06-02," I have always really enjoyed arrow but I will admit the last couple of seasons were weaker so I am happy to say that season 5 Is a real return to form for the show. The premise of the season sees oliver queen attempt to train a new team of vigilantes in an attempt to stopping a serial killer while trying to be star city's mayor during the day. Stephen amell is oliver queen and he is absolutely fantastic in this role, he totally nails the character and you really empathise with him. At times his character goes through hard times and he totally sells the anguish that he goes through so well and this is probably his best season for a dramatic performance. The supporting cast is used better this time, felicity smoak played by Emily bett Rickards becomes a lot less annoying this season and was used perfectly in her role so she didn't take over the show like I believe she has in previous seasons. Out of the new team I really liked rick Gonzalez take on wild dog and once you learn more about his back story you really do sympathise with him and care about him. David Ramsey is once again back as john diggle and even though he has slightly less to do this season he does a great job in the role especially contrasting Oliver. Prometheus is the villain of the season and I really liked his character, he is a dark reflection of oliver and once his big reveal happens it is even better as you see these two character's going head to head. The story of the season is well done seeing oliver forming these new relationships with people and learning to trust them. Also as mentioned before I feel like the villain fed into the narrative very well and did the job well. Also I actually kind of liked the flashback storyline this season, don't get me wrong it's not as good as the first two seasons but it is pretty fun to watch. The script is really good because this is the darkest of the dctv shows so it's drama is heavily relied upon and I thought really well handled. When the humour is needed it also is done pretty well to help break the tension. The style like most seasons of arrow has great action scenes that feel very gritty and real that sucks you into it, I also really enjoyed the links to the first season that is a big theme of this season. However, my one criticism of this season is that there are a few filler episodes around the half way mark that deviate from the main plot and I didn't enjoy it as much. This is a truly fantastic season of arrow that includes possibly my favourite finale of any of the seasons and the whole season is a must watch for comic book fans. ","9"
"Arrow",2017-06-01," Arrow is A DC TV Show of the superhero character Green Arrow,portrayed by Stephen Amell.I feel that Arrow is the best DC TV show,after which is Flash,Gotham and Legends of Tomorrow.Arrow has great actors,themes as well as good CGI and the villains are great.From Prometheus(portrayed by Josh Segarra-Best villain ever),Deathstroke(Manu Bennett),The dark archer(John Borrowman),followed by Ra' Al Ghul and Damien Darkh,the TV series is filled with action,drama and a little bit comedy.I highly recommend readers of this site to watch this show.However,the images of violence can sometimes be disturbing to some watchers. ","9"
"Arrow",2017-05-10," Before The Flash, I started the Arrowverse with well, this. And certainly my initial impression for the 1st season was highly positive.It is true even in the comics that Green Arrow was Batman with bow and arrows, but through the decades it has it's own nuances. While Oliver Queen's character and motivation isn't as compelling as Bruce Wayne, Ollie became a relevant figure in the DC Universe.4 seasons in and this is where I believe the show succeeds; Arrow the TV show wasn't trying to copy Batman even though on the surface it seemed the same; it tried to be it's own thing and that it works (most of the time and where it counts anyway.)The show does have flaws particularly with regards to the writing on Oliver Queen's love life which is just distracting. I think this is due to the lack of motivation in Oliver Queen's character, something that even the comic book struggles with, so I can close an eye on it.But also due to this, the direction of the show can lose focus at times and not as well paced as it should be. Again, the writers are simply working with what they have and that's not a whole lot compared to the Flash, which is why you will also see some borrowed villains from established Rogue Galleries. The real tragedy here is that while the writers have done a good job in presenting an often forgotten DC hero to a new audience, they haven't been able to build new ground on existing Green Arrow foundation which admittedly, isn't an easy task.But in all intents and purposes, they've succeeded in making Arrow relevant again and that should congratulated. ","7"
"Arrow",2017-05-07," The dialogue alone is disgustingly simplistic and common colloquialisms are misused or just downright opposite of their general meanings. If that isn't enough, the plot is ignorant of its own devices, which their writers seem to forget is what creates a believable and cohesive story line. I generally like well a designed super-hero story. This is neither well designed, nor is it  super-hero . It's more of  stupid-hero , oops I crapped my pants style of non-intellectual storytelling. I gave it 3 stars, because I almost made it through the first half of the second season. Alas, I could no longer accept the horrible dialogue, with so many new plot holes. TO THE WRITERS: you can't mask your incompetence, no matter how many sex scenes, or lesbian kiss scenes you place there to distract from your horrible stupidity, or your lack of understanding of common social behavior when speaking...out loud....to a f-ing audience. People like you are why the avg IQ is steadily dropping, thanks arrow writers... ","3"

"Arrow",2017-05-05," I'm only in Season 4, and only watching it while waiting for something better to show up. If you enjoy soap operas but would like them spiced up with repetitive gloomy fight scenes, you'll probably enjoy Arrow. That's assuming you can tolerate interminable flashbacks, lots of whining, shouting and weeping, and almost no humour to break the tedium. There is a bit of magic and high tech wizz bang stuff, and one or two characters occasionally pop in to an episode to lighten the dark mood. However, overall the show is slow, repetitive, angst-ridden, and lacking the spark that other shows of its kind have. Some of the lead characters/heroes are portrayed as being quite stupid, too - that's down to the writers/producers I guess.It's the worst of DC and not a patch on Marvel. ","4"
"Arrow",2017-02-16," I liked this show initially, but after awhile they started getting to be more and more of a soap opera, until season 5 when they just flushed themselves down the toilet. This show is now to become blatant leftist propaganda, starting first with gun control promotion, sacrificing the story to promote a political agenda. Bad form. ","1"
"Arrow",2017-02-10," This Season 5 | Episode 13 made it completely unwatchable. I won't watch any more episodes again. Some really dumb writer wrote this episode and rags contained a nuclear bomb as if it was a boiling milk. What a stu pid idea! That just made it look like a child's joke that ain't funny. I was dragging along with the episodes even though some had pretty bad solution to problems. However, this Season 5 | Episode 13 is the worst. Scratching it from my list. Writer of this show things viewers are as dumb as a pig. What a pathetic story line! Don't waste your time anymore on this show. I'm hanging on the Flash and hopefully, writer of that series is not as dumb as this one. Anywho, I wasted enough time on this and no more. ","1"
"Arrow",2017-02-01," This is the best superhero series that i have ever seen, good job guys!! I love it and can't wait to watch every episode. I was captivated since the release of the pilot episode in season one. The first season continued well, i loved the drama and the ways Oliver and his friends dealt with it. Season two was even better than the first one, i loved the plot twist's, the involvement of Roy Harper as a Arrow's trainee. Since season two i wanted to see Mr Deagle to do more action and I'm glad that my desire was satisfied later in the other seasons. It was very good decision return Sara as the  black canary  and even better idea for her sister continuing her legacy. ","10"
"Arrow",2017-01-27," Don't get me wrong, I enjoy Arrow. But I can't love it. I'm a comic fan, not so much Arrow or most mainstream titles. I love the heroines, and this is where my gripe is..I'm a massive Batgirl fan and i mean all things Batgirl. Birds of Prey second favorite. ( The birds of prey generally consist of. Batgirl, Huntress, Black Canary) many more have filled in as well(Katana, poison Ivy for examples). I also collect Black Canary. The Arrow give's no respect to Dinah Lance.(the black canary). In the real Dc universe, the black canary is considered as one the best and feared martial artists, to such a degree that she holds her own against Batman and most hero's or villains for that matter, and has beaten Arrow more than once, and would take any character on that show..Earth 2 Canary is what most books are based on.. So when I see Felicity Joke being able to knock her out in 1 hit, it make's me wonder if the writers of Arrow even know about the characters they portray. The few episodes they had Huntress(Helena Bertinelli) Who's Batman's and Selina Kyle's daughter also from Earth 2.. Show's they just love throwing any characters in without any real thought.(Mad dog, Mr terrific.. Absolute Joke's) It's like portraying Captain America with a bazooka instead of his shield..Please start showing more respect for the great characters you portray.... ","6"
"Arrow",2017-01-25," This is one of my favourite TV shows of all time. At first, I was skeptical, and only watched it because I was watching Legends, and didn't get a few things. But I am glad I did watch. The first two seasons were bloody brilliant, a perfect ten out of ten. I loved the characters and the plots, and eagerly awaited each episode. Season three was a bit disappointing, at least some of it. The first ten episodes were good, Roy being the Arsenal was bloody brilliant, and I personally loved the new characters of Ray Palmer and Maseo. Yet the entire plot of Oliver becoming Ra's was pretty disappointing though. Season four was just bad. Really the only things I enjoyed in it were the Olicity moments, which in the end ruined the season. Season five has looked promising so far. The only problem I have is that Team Arrow is overcrowded, but I do like the new team. Prometheus is awesome, and it's been a pretty epic ride so far, and I'm looking forward to plenty more. ","9"
"Arrow",2017-01-21," !!! This may contain spoilers !!! I will try to avoid spoilers but just in case... (because I hate spoilers myself). We try to find shows that already have seasons out because we binge-watch and I hate waiting for episodes. We started Arrow late last year and just finished season 4. I agree with several other reviewers about the first two seasons; great! We were hooked through he first two seasons. On that I have to give it a 9. It started going downhill on season 3.If you ever want to enjoy any of these action shows, you simply have to just ignore a certain amount of technical BS. The realities of physics and  it just doesn't work like that  that producers seem to ignore. The thing is that most of us with any sort of technical knowledge have to suffer through producers stupidity, but there comes a point when it becomes so bad that you just cant get past it. Who was it that said;  Truth is stranger than fiction because fiction has to make sense ? Arrow showed promise until there became more and more times I had to ignore stupid decisions from supposedly smart people and the all-to-common trauma to a persons body that you just don't recover from. Another reviewer complained; how do the arrows not come out of the quiver when he flips? that is ridiculous. I could easily design a quiver to hold the arrows -and there may be already some out there. However he also asked how it's possible Arrow pulls out exactly the tip he needs automatically with no apparent choosing? That is a valid question and is one of those things we are forced to overlook. Remember Hawkeye's revolving tip selector in Avengers? Excellent way to address that.Our family started criticizing the show at first for the stupid decisions, The fight scenes became noticeably amateurish and very poorly choreographed. I'm sorry but bringing people back from the dead (I'm talking dead and decomposing)is crossing the line for us. The show just went from being a great super hero action show, and turned into a soap opera complete with shoving gays in the face of my kids. Another thing is consistency. It started out that Arrow had some mad skills and would shoot weapons out of the hands of criminals. He did not hesitate. But it seamed the greater the villain, The more he lost that ability and everyone seamed to stand with there thumbs you-know-where (hesitating I guess for effect)as the villain performed his bad deeds. Too many opportunities were missed to keep you in the mindset that they were skilled operators.Season three was just questionable for us (like a 5 rating), but season four just completely went off the chain with soap opera, lousy fight scenes, stupid decisions and God-like powers leaving us feeling like we've been duped again, sucked in with a good show to hook you so you will sit through their psychotic thinking that they want to shove down your throat.Stop after season two and you will still think it's a good show. Three and four are just down in the gutter. I hope this is informative for you. ","5"
"Arrow",2017-01-18," Before I begin my review, If you are interested in watching the flash / arrow or if you watched the flash. Arrow is the perfect option. It's such a good show full of twists when turns, plot twists and nail-biting moments. If you are deciding whether to watch flash or arrow first I would definitely say arrow as there are spoilers in flash regarding arrow. But this show is a great one. There is barely any humour it is more based on action scenes and intense moments with very view funny moments as the show revolves around a Arrow and him stopping criminals. So in conclusion this show is a great one full of moments that will make you gasp and blow your mind, But if you are looking for a more light-hearted show, this isn't for you. Ahmed ","9"
"Arrow",2016-12-20," I was thrilled with the first two seasons even considering one of my favorite shows. I love the story and the action was entertaining. The main villain Deathstroke was a great villain in both the season and I think he is the best actor in this whole show. But after starting the third season and watching the season, I can say that it is absolutely terrible. The acting and dialogue is on par with Disney channel shows. The plot is so mediocre and in points I was laughing so hard at some of the scenes. Not because they were funny but because they are so terrible. I was even excited because I heard the main villain was Ra's al Ghul. I thought this would be the best season yet, but no I don't want to finish the season. After watching the 2nd season of Daredevil and going to this, it's obvious which is the better show (Daredevil). The positives I can give are the visuals and the villains are somewhat good. I questioned if I actually enjoyed the second season or if I was blind to good TV shows. The only reason I give this 4 stars is because the first two seasons are good and I would recommend you watch them both and skip the rest. ","4"
"Arrow",2016-12-19," I rated this show 5 out of 10. 5 for being interesting to watch Season 1 and 2 but really went downhill from season 3 and 4. The plot was growing strong for the first 2 seasons but what annoyed me the most and made me want to quit this show was Laurel and Felicity.1) Laurel bitches way too much.AND... 2) Oliver has to put up with Laurel's nonsense and bitching after numerous times of being told not to do certain things which get them into trouble. 3) Apparently anyone can be a superhero with just weeks of training. 4) How does Laurel become the Black Canary when she only took boxing lessons? All of a sudden she has the courage to jump off 20 ft roof tops/ swing from buildings, grapple/kick, and learn mix martial arts in just a few weeks? I thought she was a freaken Lawyer man 5) Martial Arts acting really went downhill in season 3 and 4. 6) Felicity and Oliver love scene? The show really made a thing of them two, did they run out of ideas that they went from saving the city for Oliver's dad to falling in love and revolving the show around Felicity? 7) and apparently Felicity can hack into anything at anytime. I am almost done with Season 4 but only continued because I don't want to binge a different show on Netflix while I am still on this one...Also, Thea is hot but also falls under those who learned how to fight in just a short amount of time... ","5"
"Arrow",2016-12-19," I can not but say that I am disappointed with this TV show. First season was quite awesome, all was fine, but then, it kinda lost its purpose and all was about making more money on action and action and action. I really dislike this. Good thing in this TV show was the start, the story, all was okay until some unreal things started to happen. Let me name all of those that I still remember: Oliver can do flips, rolls while no arrow ever fall out, Oliver knows exactly what arrow to take from his quiver even though most of them have different tip, he never draw his arrow first and then walk with it ready, instead, he walk with empty bow and then draws the arrow against several armed people who , as it seems, always miss him. How can a special forces team miss the guy with the arrow? The moment he moves his hand back to draw an arrow, special forces unit would kill him for sure in real life. OK, we get it, he is super fast archer even though it doesn't look like that. What else? He manages to kill the Ra's Al Ghul. This is so pathetic. Think about this, a leader of assassins talk to Oliver queen instead of simply killing him while he had a chance... That's so lame. Another crap moments were when unreal things started happening: Flash pops up, the CEO with super tech suit, Felicity who is obviously the master of everything and best hacker in the world. Please... If you want to watch this TV show, watch only first season, others are just NO. ","4"
"Arrow",2016-10-24," OK first off I like the show mind you but I mean they show him all messed up in first part but now he wasn't even on the darn island. All 5 years they have him all over the place so why in the heck he so homeless looking. The time-lines are getting on my nerves as well 5 months later 12 Min's early I'm like Jesus stop already.Having said that he is a great arrow but some of cast selections really confused me. Plus now his new team I really don't like at all they need powers I say.I wish they stick with one thing instead of jumping also to flash and other shows I mean can't flash do good on its own don't really need to show it the parts don't even have anything to do with the main story lines its just added stupid parts. ","4"
"Arrow",2016-10-11," I was skeptical about this series when I watched the 1st episode. I only continued to the next after watching the Flash's 1st episode where Arrow appeared with all his coolness. The following episodes were OK to watch doing something else in parallel, until I reached the 7th. There I was completely hooked and devoured everything including 3rd season, as soon as I could. The problems I had was with those annoying flashbacks. Even if there were some interesting stories, the past is the past and it is useless to cover half of the episode just to tell us how he learned to fight and make enemies. Still the action was interesting and the drama (when it was avoiding melodrama) was acceptable. Amell, Barrowman, for the guys and Law for the women were my favorite, the rest were OK, while I never liked snuffly Holland and omnipresent Rickards.The 4th season had really great potential and first episodes were very promising.  Ghosts  and Constantine were fitting very well, but suddenly the series lost its focus. Characters were not properly introduced, but were coming out of nowhere to make an easy finale for one and only episode etc etc. I'm now at s05e01 and although Arrow seems to return to his origins and the flashbacks are more delicate (missing 5 years, this should be the last season with flashbacks!, hopefully), we are already informed that his days as lone-avenger will be off soon. And I will stop watching because I don't want to see same story again and again. The only reason I might watch is to be informed about its status before cross- overs with other series. It's a pity because the character Arrow is much more interesting than Barry Allen ","6"
"Arrow",2016-10-10," This show started off great from season 1, onto season 2, then it began to slow down a bit in season 3 and 4, but it picks up again with action in season 5. There are many story line build ups, and great flashbacks, and it also compliments with the action and fight scenes. One major critic of the show will be how the writers will often attempt to put in too many love sequences in a super hero show, another will be how the story doesn't follow up as well with the Green Arrow comics. If the show sticks to its action first and love story later, it will stay more consistent to what fans would love to see, and this will keep the show alive for a longer number of seasons. The best part of this show is that it provides its viewers with crossover episodes, and team ups with other super hero shows such as the Flash. These crossover episodes provides more action and delivers a comic book genre type of team up for fans or even non comic book fans to enjoy. On a side note, season 2 of this show is by far the best TV show season I have ever watched. Even if you do not have time watching this show, just watch season 2, you won't regret it. ","10"
"Arrow",2016-10-05," Started out great, season 1 and season 2 were so good, I was so excited for season 3 but it was simply disappointing.Just when I thought it couldn't get any worse season 4 came out and proved me wrong. This show needs to be canceled. From a great superheroes show it became a cheesy boring soap opera that makes me wanna puke every time I watch it.Do yourself a favor and avoid this show. It's not even worth the first two seasons since it went downhill so badly. Thinking how great it was and how lame it is now makes me wanna cry, if I knew how bad its going to get I wouldn't have even started it in the first place. ","1"
"Arrow",2016-10-02," As i don't want to write spoilers, i wont give many details. This is my opinion IMHO:The show starts quite good, i had fun for most of the first season. The second season was kinda meh, and had some lame parts, but was OK overall - that mirakuru stretch was just awful - BTW why didn't they invite bane? If you had hopes that the show could get better and not worse, wait for Season 3 where the story writing really goes downhill to a point that it's unwatchable, the chapters are 40 min long, moistly half of it is soap opera like talking and planing. Many things he could have done solo, now he needs the help of 2 or 3 friends just out of convenience (like fighting some random bad guy) Pretty much anyone can use a bow and arrow as its super easy (sarcasm), and also suddenly everybody becomes a fighter, even Thea - this is so lame! And BTW, oliver is a real jerk, he couldn't even give felicity the bottle of wine he promised in the first season (yes, this bothers me). Overall the directing is bad and amateurish, the show is very lame and stupid, inconsistent, has bad acting like a bunch of wax figures (mostly oliver and laurel) bad outfits, lots of clichés (like the bad guy that talks too much). Also the show is more like a soap opera and that got on my nervs - i don't'care about so many details of olivers sex life, of who is dating who, of all the flirting. Isn't this a superheroe movie? or is it a superheroe soap opera??I Coulnd't finish season 3, and i will not watch further.well, you get the idea right? if you like a smart and interesting show, with good writing and acting, skip this one.if you didn't already, then take a look at shows like continuum, chuck, torchwood, daredevil, burn notice (just to say a few).

"Arrow",2016-09-30," Unfortunately, I would be heartless to give this film a zero star rating but that is about all it deserves,thinking of some people actually wasting time to do this saddens me. There are lots of things to criticize about Arrow starting from their inoriginality down to the excess exaggeration.What surprises me is how the producer did things that made me wonder if there was actual thought put in the production especially the death of Thea and the rise of Sara.Another thing that spoiled the series apart from the relationship with laurel lance was Laurel herself.She kept on doing things that were poorly thought to say the least,in addition to developing super fighting within such a short period.Luckily for we viewers I heard she died which automatically earns a plus on the producer side unfortunately the damage had been done. Irrespective they might actually have a shot to bounce back, Afterall aren't all superhero films enjoyable ? ","3"
"Arrow",2016-09-11," Dear Oh Dear. I actually (unbelievably ) watched 2 whole seasons of this, because at first I thought it had potential, and the story was OK. I expected it to get better. It is a fantasy about a superhero, so I am happy to suspend disbelief and take it for what it's worth. But enough is enough ! The point it really lost me was not the bad acting, Beverley Hills 90210 type relationship drama or the rest of the criticisms thrown at this show. No, it lost me when EVERYONE ends up being a superhero too. Like his skinny sister who could hardly be strong enough to knock down a six year old takes martial arts lessons and after 6 months or less is an ace superhero herself beating up beefy bad guys. Then his girlfriend Laurel or whatever, ( also so skinny she could barely stand up in a strong wind, let alone get in a fight ), takes lessons at a boxing gym and after 3 months, hey presto, she becomes a masked superhero too, and is wiping the floor with bad guys. Impossible , I hear you say. No way , I hear you say. But no, the writers expect us to swallow that. Like another reviewer said, this could only appeal to 6 year olds, or people with low IQ. ","1"
"Arrow",2016-09-11," (Warning: Spoilers!!!!!!!!!!!) Hi, my name is Thunderin' Tim and I'll be your reviewer today. So I started watching Arrow and after only 10 episodes felt the need to deliver a review to the millions of awaiting fans (cut to a scene with me behind a signing desk and nobody waiting in line). There is a fair set-up with lots of potential. There is a big flaw, many things I liked, and some smaller issues and flaws <U+0096>I will discuss it in this order so it's not all good or bad but a nice mix.Flaw <U+0096> Slow Down Brotha' Just relax a little. The pace is ridiculous. The first episode: Oliver Queen was in a boat accident and he stranded on an island with more stuff going on than Lost and he comes back after being presumed dead and he returns to the party life but is also a funky version of Robin Hood at night fighting crime whilst juggling a social life that includes his new step daddy, his wayward sis, an ambiguous mom, a best friend who possible slept with his former girlfriend, whose sister was his lover and died in the same boat accident and the girls' father, who's a cop, hates him and<U+0085>. Slow down please! I thought this and then I saw I only was 20 minutes into the show. It's not necessary, it feels rushed, and it doesn't give you time to really like or understand the characters.Good stuff <U+0096> Let's Kick Some Butt I like the Monster of the Week style of this early episodes because it reminds me of early Buffy, early X-Files and early Supernatural and that's not a bad thing. I like Ollie and the actor playing him. I dig Dig. Thea is insanely hot. I like the Queen Family dynamic. I like the fighting scenes, makes me want to beat someone up and then run away like a real super hero. I like the flashbacks to the island, and I especially like the crazy Asian dude on it. I like Felicity although I hope she doesn't turn out to be a Garcia from Criminal Minds character, who solves everything the same way every episode.Issues 1)Hypocrite: Queen suffers from HHH, and I don't mean the wrestler but Hollywood Hypocrite Heroism <U+0096>the disease that makes a main white male character judge people for doing the same as he (Jack from 24, Jack from Lost etc). This becomes clear when he is obsessively protective about Thea, who as a teenager goes to clubs, has love interests, and drinks (normal teen stuff). Queen hates it violently whilst himself having did half of Starling City and being a party boy from the same age. Then in episodes 7 and 8, he meets a girl, does her of course, and upon finding out that she kills bad guys, that are either Triade or Mafia, you know, what he has been doing EVERY EPISODE, he is morally outraged and tries to stop her. With what right? You do the exact same thing.2)She's your sister, you creep!: Ollie and Thea have a weird, almost flirty relationship. He's overly protective, threatens anyone who looks at her whilst being male, she's very touchy, even touching his scars and muscles. But the worst moment is when he catches her making out in a bra. The boy gets a three second warning before being drowned in a bucket of his least favorite soda, but Ollie keeps watching Thea whilst she redresses. Dude! If I walk in on my sister like that I will leave and apologize, or tell the dude to get lost WHILST AVERTING MY GAZE. Not look at her like a pervert.3)Less Than Zero: The BFF character is nice and all, although the 2 of them look like they left the pages of a Bret Easton Ellis novel, but he gets so little background I found him rather useless. Yes he slept with Laurel, and yes he's Ollie's BFF and yes his father cuts him off, but none of it tickled my senses.4)Give me the D: Ollie casually informs him that he knows who killed Dig's brother; informs him how he knows; and informs him he already killed him with all the intensity of debating the baseball results you don't really care about. It's his brother, tell him sooner and better.5)Go back to Ferguson!: the cop character, Laurel's father, is annoying the hell out of me. You're not Riggs from Lethal Weapon nor do you have his goodwill-factor, so take a chill pill.6)Leather Locklear ( High Five!  I shout to an empty apartment): out of all fabrics used to make clothing, the worst one when you expect to do more movement than an Olympic Gymnast, is leather. Why not wear cotton or silk since it gives you much more moving room? DC's and Marvel's obsession with putting hot guys in tight leather outfits brings up some awkward questions.Preliminary conclusion: I like Arrow but it will not make Top 10 List. It doesn't intrigue me like X-Files or Californication. I sort of miss the DC feel to it. There are good characters and some nice acting, set design, special effects, and story line, but it also feels rushed and at times, times which call for passionate acting, weirdly passive and muted. The women in the show look fine, as do the guys I would imagine. It looks sharp and high budget. I'm highly curious where it's all going. There are many flaws and slight annoyances, like everyone being either good or bad and Hoodie rarely missing where other highly trained bad guys miss more often than early Stormtroopers. And everyone let's Ollie get away with way to much stuff, but all in all I like it and it didn't put me off and I will keep watching it to see what will happen.Will come back later ","7"
"Arrow",2016-09-09," This show USED TO be great!!!At the moment i am at the end of the 3rd season and i think i won't be watching the show any more. Writers have been doing their job very poorly and there are many flaws!IF ANYTHING CAN RESCUE THIS SHOW IS FLASHPOINT! AND I MEAN IT! JUST GO BACK AT LEAST AT THE HALF OF THE THIRD SEASON WHEN NO ONE KNOWS AND ALL THAT STUFF WITH THE POLICE, IF IT IS TOO MUCH TO GO BACK FURTHER. IT WILL MAKE SHOW GREAT AGAIN!There is no need for other side kicks than Arsenal!Only Arrow, Diggle, Felicity and Arsenal! Please ! ","3"
"Arrow",2016-09-05," The series starts off on a high but keeps falling to new low as the new seasons come in. When the show was only about an arrow drawing vigilantly, it used to be fun, but each new season introduces ludicrous plot. Now we have super humans, magic, people returning from dead and lots of stupid script and plotting. Season One <U+0096> Introduces us to Oliver Queen aka Arrow, didn't know much about him although a lot of parallels could be drawn with Batman. This season has strong plotting, intriguing story, witty humor & good cinematic action sequences. The acting starts on a low but the cast find their feet by the end of the season. (8/10)Season Two <U+0096> It's about the reformed non killing Arrow & the story supports the agenda perfectly. Lots of character development for the supporting cast making for an overall better team, we get to see a lot more of DC universe and it look promising, we get cameos of the Flash & the Suicide squad. The plot revolves around a Demon from Arrows past, the intrigue of past made for a fun watch. The bad guy in this season was probably the perfect antagonist to the Arrow. Besides being a better actor, his presence and skill were just superb. The finale of the season did get overblown with the introduction of superhuman and the ending was not as strong as I had expected, still a superior season than the first one. (8/10) Season Three <U+0096> Starts on a high then loses itself until an exceptional mid season episode of a dual high up in mountains and then spirals down for a new low by the end of the season. The way League of Assassin was used turned out to be a botched up job. This season had better actors & acting just the script and plotting were terrible. The policy of not killing a non-reform-able mass murder was so frustrating. (5/10)Season Four <U+0096> The plot was ridiculous, spoiled it all for me. Enjoyed the cameos of Flash, Vixen & Constantine but the guys from Arrow itself had only self-pitying or obnoxious roles. The show has turned into a romantic soap-opera having good action sequences. (3/10) ","6"
"Arrow",2016-09-02," A Nolan-Esque show that managed to balance comic book vigilantism and family drama simultaneously that sadly became relationship orientated, outweighing the comic book elements that were much loved. Season one and two are by no means perfect however definitely provide enjoyment to both comic book fans and the general audiences alike. Darker, gritter and cliff hanger filed Arrow set the trend for most comic book shows to come. Dealing with themes that include; Redemption, Identity, Addiction, Trust and so much more the show manages to feel fresh while recycling the that of what has already been done. Unfortunately season four does not follow its predecessors, even though the second half of season three was a large step-down from the prior seasons, it still manages to be one of the worst comic book show seasons to date. Filled with pointless story lines, aimed to prop up and centralize a relationship, introduce meaningless characters and create even more relationships. Hopefully the fifth season can bring back what once was. ","5"
"Arrow",2016-08-30," Review of Season One: I'm no huge superhero fan so it's with some trepidation that I sat down to watch ARROW, my first fully-fledged superhero TV series. The good news is that I ended up liking it, although I wouldn't say love. The series is flawed by being overlong and endlessly dragged out with trivial plot points and villain-of-the-week story lines, but it still has an interesting set up and lots of good stuff to counter the bad.One of the main problems I have with the show is Stephen Amell as the protagonist. I find the guy a conceited jerk, his arrogance extremely off putting, and that opinion only cemented itself as the episodes went by. On the other hand, David Ramsey gives a strong turn as Arrow's sidekick Diggle, and Paul Blackthorne is very believable as the weary cop on his tail.The show has a bit of an odd format whereby half the scenes are told in flashback, exploring Arrow's history on a desert island where he gets involved with some renegade soldiers. These flashbacks lack impact because they've already taken place and are kind of shoehorned into the main, present day narrative. But they do allow for a couple of cool actors, namely Byron Mann and Manu Bennett, to do cool stuff, so I didn't mind too much. ARROW is an easy show to watch because action scenes are inserted into every episode and the action is choreographed as it should be: violent, hard-hitting, and fast-paced; it doesn't disappoint. It's a more than watchable show, which is why I'll be coming back for season two.Review of Season Two:Season Two of ARROW is firmly in the category of 'more of the same'. It follows exactly the same template as the successful first season, with the main story told chronologically alongside various flashbacks to Arrow's time on the desert island and his interactions with Slade Wilson (the great Manu Bennett, still the best thing in the show). The contemporary material has more of a story arc feel to it here, less villain of the week, more building towards something big.The action scenes are quite fun, although repetitively staged at times and always seeming to take place in the dark, which gets a bit annoying. I didn't like the last episode, which utilises confusing choreography and time-swapping to poor effect, but otherwise this show is pretty decent. I'm still no fan of the main actor but the supporting cast are fun and you get people like Colin Salmon and Summer Glau turning up just to show you how it's done. ","6"
"Arrow",2016-08-24," We all know who Bruce Wayne is, Who Clark Kent is, and who Diana Prince is but not many are familiar with who Oliver Queen is. After you watch this show you will definitely remember the name Oliver Queen. I truly love it when comic book companies make a great TV series with a character who previously wasn't as famous and well known as they were prior to the TV show. Arrow is a great show that explores DC's darker side. The Dark Knight also know as Batman has some of his greatest enemies cross paths with The Arrow, which ends up with both men having to fight till death. Some villains discover who The Arrow truly really is under the hood and that puts his friends and family at great risk. Oliver Queen also known as The Green Arrow is one of my new favourite comic characters of all time. For the record before this TV series was even released I had no clue who Oliver Queen or The Green Arrow was. I owe the creator and cast of this show a big high five and hug for doing such a great job in bringing a not so familiar name to the small screen. Some of you may say  but hey I know Oliver Queen/The Green Arrow, I have seen him in a animated series as a kid growing up  Well the unfortunate part is that not many people have seen the animated series where Batman and The Green Arrow fight side by side to stop crime in their cities. This show does not lack in action, comedy or deep emotional moments. It has everything it needs to be one of the best DC TV series today. From season 1 to now you truly have the privilege to see Oliver Queens mindset and views on life drastically change after each new experience he encounters. Whether The Green Arrow dodges death or saves his city once again Oliver Queens life will never truly be normal. Everyone he loves and truly cares for will always be at risk. Arrow starts off as a realistic crime TV series but then later on develops into a true comic book masterpiece. Comic book TV shows have always been around even when some of us didn't even exist. Arrow truly put DC Comics on the map with this great show. The Flash and Legends of Tomorrow wouldn't even exist if it wasn't for The Green Arrow. It truly started something great for DC in the TV industry. Comic book fan or not, Arrow is for an audience all over the world. Before this show I had no clue who The Arrow was and why they would make a show about a comic book character who not many are familiar with. It makes all sense to me now... Introducing new characters from comics we no longer have so much access to is a great way to expand the DC universe and get new fans to adore a character who has been hidden or over shadowed by other superheroes. In my honest opinion I strongly suggest viewers to give this show a chance. You wont regret it. Some comic book fans are probably already sold way before reading a review or seeing a trailer online which is a good thing as this show definitely does not disappoint . But to those who have no knowledge of the DC comic book world please don't get discouraged as this show is literally for anyone. Comic book geek or not this show truly makes you want to see more and more after each episode. Arrow started it all when it comes to DC's TV series success and believe me it will continue for many more years to come. I truly hope people watch this show. They are in store for an amazing experience :) ","10"
"Arrow",2016-08-21," 'Arrow'd'. A show being Arrow'd means it went from being great, to utterly terrible. Arrow has been Arrow'd. Remember when Arrow was easily one of the best Superhero TV shows ever? And was even one of the most quality shows on television? When the writing was gritty, mysterious, and left you wanting more? When each character would enter the show, they'd bring a new and dynamic approach? How every villain would differ from the other? If you don't remember that, then you probably started watching after s2. And for that, I sincerely apologize.Now let's get down to business. Arrow used to be great. Hell, Arrow used to be a lot of good things. Now there isn't a positive thing to say. The writing is below par, the story lines, the plots, character and/or development are all terrible. Felicity isn't the problem, it's the writers. Guggenheim & co. They took a very good character, and milked the absolute crap out of her. Felicity Smoak should of NEVER been a main character. She was at her best when she was only supporting. Characters like Felicity should never be main characters on Superhero shows. Soap Operas & drama's? Hell yes, for sure. A character that brings nothing more than romance, and Soap Opera-type drama should never of even touched Arrow. Now the overall writing. It's bland. It's cliché. It's BORING. We are COMIC BOOK FANS. We don't come here to cry over relationships, or intend to see 40 minutes of pure drama. We come to watch Green Arrow beat up bad guys, save his city & just be downright awesome. (Keep in mind, this review is for the present Arrow, s3 & 4. S1& 2 is a whole different ball game.) And lastly, the acting. Let's talk about the god damn acting. Back in the golden age of Arrow, we experienced good acting. We were drawn into the characters, the actors made us genuinely care about them. Amell was strange, dark & mysterious. He was destroyed inside. Bennett was brutal, he was menacing. He never let up. We wanted to hate him, but Manu's dynamic ability to show us so many sides & layers to Wade Wilson was phenomenal. Now we get sub par level acting. No dynamic abilities. No layers. No thought provoking performances, or performances that make us go  OH MY GOD . It's the type of acting you expect from a crappy Romcom. And ironically enough, it's the sort of acting that you expect from a Soap Opera. Overall Arrow really doesn't deserve the popularity it's still getting. It's a clear & utter cash cow of a project. Passion & dedication completely went out of the window when Kreisberg & Berlanti left and gave Guggenheim control. Nobody is involved with Arrow that actually cares about anymore. Writers & actors alike. Now all it is, is a shell of its former self. A show completely destroyed & ripped to pieces by itself. 1/10 DO NOT WATCH S3, S4. I highly recommend watching S1 & 2. Those seasons were amazing. Also, I don't recommend tuning in for the upcoming seasons. I have no faith in Arrow anymore. Tune into other shows. I highly suggest Netflix's Daredevil. Daredevil is the sort of show that Arrow would of been if Guggenheim was nerve given complete control. Hell, Daredevil is even a step up from the early Arrow seasons. ","1"
"Arrow",2016-08-11," Arrow is a show that has a lot of meaning to it that included in each episode. You can take many things from watching this series but more than that you are able to see over the period of this series the sacrifices that Oliver Queen must make in order for the greater good. In order for him to save the city he has to be more than a man but by doing that he has to become less human. The meanings from this series can be taken out and applied to real life situations. That in order to achieve a certain goal you will need to make certain sacrifices. During the duration of this series you are able to see how Oliver Queen has developed as a person and as a hero and sometimes lines are crossed for the greater good. By doing so however you are able to see the differences of how Oliver Queen handles such setbacks. The realistic part of this show is that if you choose the life of a crime fighter people will always get hurt and may even die and that even though you wear a mask your loved ones are still in danger.

"Arrow",2016-08-06," I love this show, always have, always a will, it's what first got me into watching live action comic book to shows and films. Everyone's character is awesome, and as long as Oliver and Felicity aren't going through any drama, him having a happy, healthy relationship is a fresh touch too. What I can't stand is Laurel's character, I hope Katie Cassidy is nowhere near a self-indulged/obsessed moron in real life cause it just means she's a tremendous actress. Someone could be going through the final stages of their death and Laurel would be there to say  but how do you think this makes ME feel? . You can literally predict when she's gonna be self-obsessed because she makes almost all topics about her. I want you to play a game for me, well two games. 1. Drink every time she manages to swing a subject so she becomes sub-topic, and 2. Take a lick of your rum and raisin ice-cream every time she says  me  or  I  and I promise you, you'll be wasted after 10 minutes. I only mentioned rum and raisin ice cream because of the low alcohol content, so the statement should be supported by its own legs. Anyway, Arrow is amazing, and I don't mean to sound harsh, or callous, but I'm glad the character Laurel is dead because I hate the sincerely self-obsessed/indulged/righteous, the ones who truly get upset and screechy because the person in hand wasn't thinking about them for once. I realise this was more of a rant than a review, but I've speed watched seasons 3&4, and it just got to me. ","9"

"Arrow",2016-07-11," Okay. Here it goes 1. Bad acting(Mainly by Arrow,Speedy,Lancel sisters& Felicity) 2. Poor direction and writing 3. Bad fighting choreography 4. Terrible costumes 5. Bad acting 6. Ripping off scenes and moments from Nolan's batman trilogy 7. Bad acting 8. Felicity Smoak 9. Bad acting 10.Sometimes is just a boring soap opera The cringe is too muchMost of the cool stuff happens inside your head. You have to imagine it up. I only stick around and bear the show because am a DC fan. Just stick with The Flash. Miles better than supergirl anyway Producers of Arrow,you have failed this series. ","5"
"Arrow",2016-06-29," To be honest, the first half of season one was slow, but after that, this has become one of my favourite t.v. shows to date. It's stories are strong, characters interesting, (except Moria and Thea and thanks for offing her at the end of season 2 Slade) and some of the awesomest action sequences this side of The Walking Dead! If you don't know a lot about the comic story lines published by DC, that's no issue. They don't really follow any stories from the comics which is my only real complaint. Anyhow, this show is awesome and you should check it out! It's entertaining in all the right ways that a superhero show should be. I can't wait for it to return. ","8"
"Arrow",2016-06-21," After an OK first season this show didn't start to go down, it fell of a cliff. I don't know where to start if I'm honest, the acting is terrible, the  actors  were clearly chosen based on their looks rather than their skill. The directing is not great and while season one had some good fight scenes things got worse and worse as the show went on. Green Arrow's initials are GA, which is appropriate because this show should be called Gossip Arrow (GA), it's a soap opera with people getting shot by arrows. There are plot holes all over the place,the writers use deus ex machina moments to get the hero from most situations and the story goes to complete sh** after season two. This show's target audience are either teen girls or people with really low standards (probably both) Don't waste your life on this so called show, if you like superheroes just watch Daredevil, in terms of quality Daredevil is Mozzart and Arrow is Nicky Minaj.

"Arrow",2016-06-20," I started watching this show in a rather a circuitous way. I was watching Flash, which I really enjoyed and in one of the Flash episodes, I came across some Arrow characters. My 14 year old son suggested that I watch Arrow first. I just finished all 3 seasons (69 episodes) on Netflix and compelled to write this review.The first season was sort of fun and crisp moving. Having said that, what started as a  Super hero  show turned out to a day time soap Opera of a dysfunctional family with debauchery, stupidity, ambiguity & just plain O'l dumbness all around. So, why did I watch all the episodes? Simple, the female characters in this show are smoking hot!!. Willa Holland as Thea queen, Katie Cassidy as Laurel Lance, Emily Bett Rickards as Felicity Smoak to name a few.Now, let's talk about some of the characters in the show. I promise that there are NO SPOILERS. 1) Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell): The main character (i.e. Arrow). Good looking and very handsome, no doubt. However, he is little slow witted. Starting season 2, he does not want to use lethal force and that repeatedly comes back to bite him in the a**. I am not a violent person, however in some situations as a supposed savior of the city, you have to use lethal force2) Laurel Lance (Katie Cassidy): Oliver's girlfriend and a wannabe vigilante. How can anybody be so dumb and be a vigilante without any training. She gets her beautiful ass kicked repeatedly. She is really hot and her curves are kicking.3) Thea Queen (Willa Holland): Oliver's spoiled little sister and is a real babe. Her mid riff is absolutely gorgeous. I don't want to talk about her more and give away some surprises.4) Felicity Smoak: Blond and brainy (that is not an oxymoron). I just adore this character. She is funny, chirpy and touches your heart with her double entendre sentences. ","5"
"Arrow",2016-06-20," The struggle for redemption, forgiveness and becoming a better person. This is what this show is all about. Throughout every season, Oliver's desire to keep his city out of danger is tested but as always, he manages to overcome anything thrown his way. This take on DC's 'Green Arrow' keeps you hooked throughout every season and never leaves a moment of action-packed ass- kicking. There are, however, some episodes that do let you down but, 'Arrow' does not disappoint and keeps you at the edge of your seat every time.Playboy Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell), decides to go on a trip with his father. But after an accident, he gets stranded on a mysterious island called Li-An-Yu. After five years, he returns to Starling City as a reformed man. But Oliver is back with an agenda - to get rid of all evil poisoning his city... with the help of a bow and arrow. What ensues is Oliver's on-going battle with his own inner-demons whilst punishing those who is a threat. With the help of his friends, John Diggle (David Ramsey), Felicity Smoak (Emily Bett Rickards) and Laurel Lance (Katie Cassidy), Oliver learns to manage his break down his own walls and work as the vigilante known as 'The Green Arrow'.Amell's portrayal as the newly reformed Oliver Queen intrigues you instantly and makes you wonder about his story and his motivation. His right-hand man John Diggle quickly becomes a brother-figure to him which Oliver takes time getting used to. Ramsey's performance of the ex- military is great and acting as 'the voice of reason', provides the viewers an insight into the rational side of a catastrophe. Emily Bett Rickards as Felicity Smoak is just... the perfect casting. Her as the bubbly I.T girl is amazing and her ramblings distracts you from the action - only if it's for a few moments. Katie Cassidy as Laurel is great too and as Oliver's ex, definitely is an example of how an ex should be... supportive and a great friend.The first season, as are all first seasons in every show, is the introductory one where you get to know the characters and what their agendas are. So you don't get to see much. But, the subsequent seasons takes you down a darker route, where Oliver's main goal is one thing and one thing only - making sure Starling City is a save place to live. The flashbacks does take you away from the primary story, which can be frustrating, but manages to give an insight into what happens to Oliver when he is stranded on Li-An-Yu. Overall, I think you can give this show a chance. The dark tones are refreshing and there are some comedic moments which provides relief, so you don't feel depressed after watching an episode. ","7"
"Arrow",2016-06-19," Okay i realize this show is gearing itself for the demographics of 15-23 with anyone older probably still living at home with parents (coincidentally like our  hero  Oliver Queen. The pilot was really promising but the subsequent shows are mediocre at best. Some irritants: 1. i swear there must be 3-4  i'm sorry but i was wrong  maudlin moments in each episode. It's pathetic and lame. 2. His sister is annoying = personality wise, that dreadful whinny voice. Have more vertigo will ya sweetie? 3. The characters & dialogue = including the villains - are out of central casting of the 90210 abandoned lot 4/ The hero in every episode is always doing some workout routine shirtless. Okay. The kid is in shape but we get it already! 5. Another rich kid super hero. Oh how original! Living in a mansion that he probably leased from Bruce Wayne.My favorite and most anticipated moments in the show are the flashbacks to the island where Oliver was marooned on for 5 years. It's got a  lost  feel to it and it keeps me somewhat curious and wanting more.But the show itself? They could do better. It's more cartoon-like than it is dark. ","5"
"Arrow",2016-06-19," You have failed this show! The first two seasons were brilliant. -meaningful flashbacks -great villains -good pacing -fitting dark tone Season 3 had a drop in quality, and season 4 completely butchered a fantastic show. In season 4: -horrible meaningless flashbacks -worse acting -terrible villains -unfitting lighter tone -illogical story lines with many plot holes -more like a soap opera than a superhero/crime drama TV show -butchering of major story lines like Andy Diggle, Oliver's child, HIVERating for season 1 and 2: 8.7/10 Rating for season 3: 7.5/10 Rating for season 4: 5/10 ","6"
"Arrow",2016-06-16," I just watched the end of the season 4 and I feel so big sorrow how good serial can go to hell. There are many good serials which in last couple of years show up. From Flash, Gotham, Marvel line to Arrow and all have one fatal flaw; when they start they are very well prepared and great on storyline, believability and pace<U+0085> in many of them second or latest third series the strain on fast creation and script writing with checking if it has even a logical continuity goes to hell.That's when you watch the last couple of parts of season 4 you are just thinking it would be more merciful if the show just ended. Brilliant story telling were replaced by long reminiscences of being or not being guilty. Commander who send's their troops against main villain which in the end is the level of all powerful, just knowing they are going slaughtered. Spartan who as ex-soldier is having complete break down and do not follow any orders (in general ever). The mighty Arrow who goes to make a speech to people on street which magically save the day {when in normal day most of the people would not even care}. Magical hacking which sends something to infinite loop, which ends in 24hours. Pathetic  Spiderman end cliché  when in the most crucial moment fighting the main villain people start throwing stones<U+0085> Damien Dark who by the way in blink of the aye killed approx. 20 people and evaporate bullets; controlling by mind things miles away - cannot kill that one pathetic person.Arrow when started was great show, amazing even. Now it's a pathetic sentimentality rewind of all possible cliché which were ever written and can be repeated on weekly basis just to get the show running. ","5"
"Arrow",2016-06-13," After achieving dizzying heights in season 2 everything fell apart. Admittedly season 3 wasn't too bad, but season 4 was forgettable and regrettable that I wasted so much time watching it, hoping that it'd eventually get better but that hope turned into a despair with each episode.Put it short, what once was a crime fighting super hero show that was both fun and exciting has now been turned into as laborious ill fated love drama which seem to be intentionally catered towards girls rather than faithful fans of previous seasons. For this reason, there seem to be a trend of girls giving high ratings for the season 4, citing their love for Olicity...If I wanted to watch self centred girls exercising girl power in the form of bossing your loved ones and accusing them at every opportunity of some ill doing and lying, then I'd watch Sex and the City. And yet this is what happens in just about every episode of Arrow season4, with Felicity being its main instigator, who is about a couple of steps away from boiling a bunny. I can understand what the writers are trying to do, create strong female character equal to Arrow, but this isn't the way to do it, they couldn't have made a worse example of it. There is no need to get into how awful the Felicity character has turned into this season, many have mentioned that already, but one cannot get away from the fact that she represents everything that is terrible about season 4.I have no idea what's in store for season 5, but anything short of killing off Felicity will probably mean the continuation of the same drab that was the season 4, and what a shame that would be to completely ruin what once was a great show.

"Arrow",2016-06-07," I must say that is very good, have excellent adaptations , in fact the character of Ra's ghul has a 10 , did not give it excellent because even without being disguised as much notice your makeup, but as for the series think it has much filler but from there on out is an excellent series and highly recommended , my favorite character is Felicity :)I think history and how they have been engaging characters is great, to say the crossover are sensational and the fact that competing is sometimes fantastic , subtracts emphasize that I am waiting for the next season , in which I hope to surprise me with the following but no enemy character who appears on the scene.I know it's difficult to do this and continue with the relationship between series but I trust the writers and have not been disappointed , make a micro universe which has grown and I think the cast could hardly be better, my best wishes to the series.

"Arrow",2016-05-30," The show was once good, in fact it was great. The first two seasons proved that arrow was a great show and had the pointal to be even better. While there were some issues like never really showing any blood, that was just a minor detail. Now the show is garbage and should be canceled. The show started to get worse every season and is losing its way. Season 3 and 4 focused more on the side characters and his relationship then Oliver and what he does. The plot is now just plain silly and the characters and what they do is dumb. IN the season four final the enemies drop the guns that they have without using them and start a fist fight, oilver gets the whole town(that for some reason was no police or military) to help him and beat the ninja's. It is a plot a kid can come up with plus it is a end of the world scenario. ","1"
"Arrow",2016-05-26," At the beginning this show it was a massive hit, great stunts, acting and everything until season 3 which was the peak, Slade Wilson was a great villain and the actor was awesome. The show was very entertaining at the time, then we got season 4 first few episodes i started to doubt why did i like this show in the first place, they introduced this new villain Damien Dark, who for some reason have an entire army and no one can do anything about it and the Arrow fights them with his team solo, i liked the idea with Slade Wilson, but now its happening all over again, i got bored by the second episode till the end of the season. the only good thing that happened that they finally killed the black canary  Laurel  she was so annoying and useless, the other thing that i hated about this show is the island, what are they actually thinking, they gave an excellent background story from season 3, and now he is on the island again doing things that i don't actually care about, they didn't even bother to give him a wig or anything to tell that they are not shooting both scenes at the same time, it was so lame and unnecessary, i didn't feel like i was related to the island anymore which was the reason why i started watching this show. i think this show should end now, another season would be a catastrophe.

"Arrow",2016-05-23," I cannot put in words how awful this show has gotten. It started of so well in season 1, carried on being great till season 3 and I loved it. Now it's gotten to a point where I actually started to hate it and I just want it to end.If you are already watching this show and did not make it past season 3, you might as well just start watching My Little Pony after season 3 because the Arrow we all knew has died, and so has the purpose of the whole series. This show is ruined, and so will be your life if you ever decide to watch season 4I cannot take it anymorePLEASE MAKE IT STOP!!! ","1"
"Arrow",2016-05-20," What started as a promising show years ago, is now complete garbage. They all died and they all come back to life. Its like watching a Spanish tevenovela. And the flashbacks from the island, oh man. So bad i wanna cry. The Oliver Queen character is progressing same atm and on the island. And it doesn't even make sense. The parts with magic are so confusing, they tried to fill the gap with flashbacks from the island but its just so f bad. Also the magic effects look like something from a kids show like power rangers. I really cant find a good aspect of this show. And i tried so much to do so. This season will be my last, cause id be taking this show of my list. For the end sorry that my garbage English has the same quality as this show. ","1"
"Arrow",2016-05-18," WTH? 8.0? For what? Camera shakes consistently like it is a found footage movie. The action and acting is the worst. Like watching them over act. Stone wall acting. Anything on CW is towards the younger people, like teenagers and 20 something.I loved Supernatural until they totally went religious on the show to fight the demons. Pretty much all the shows on CW are for the 20 something and younger audience. This is not good TV, it is just biased towards the younger generation.The camera shaking is annoying as heck. How can people enjoy that? Unless, you are a found footage lover. Which, I am not one at all. Hate them with a passion. There are so many trailers that fool you into seeing the movie and you go to the theater to find out it is all shaky camera.Nothing interesting about found footage at all, and to hear people say the horror movies that are found footage are scary is beyond annoying too. Nothing to watch on television except this and this is not even that good. Surprised it has lasted this long on television, but usually the crap last longer than the better stuff that gets canceled.

"Arrow",2016-05-13," This show is absolutely excellent. The story lines are interesting and involving, the characters are well developed, and all in all its just a must watch for DC fans. However there is one massive issue. Laurel. She is a whiny, overacting, pathetic, weak willed, narcissistic, selfish, egotistical, manipulative, useless, inconsiderate, disrespectful and just generally awful character. I simply cannot stress how much she worsens this absolutely fantastic program. So I warn viewers - please continue to watch the show and to battle through her whinging. Even as the canary she is just the most feeble and naff vigilante/hero. Sara was kick ass! And then Laurel took 2 weeks of boxing classes, cut a mask out of a cereal box, decided to become a hero to  avenge Sara blah blah blah  and proceeded to become even more of a liability to the main team. The gimmicky canary scream just worsens the case. Every single fight scene is simply Laurel running in, making a stupid face and screeching like a canary before being subsequently battered and chucked aside like a soggy piece of bog roll. Deservedly so. In the comics she was shown as a strong and independent woman! Yet in this she is portrayed as a desperate, needy, over-demanding cow. ","8"

"Arrow",2016-05-11," Creating live-action comicbook adaptations comes with a risk. For starters, you begin the game with the racial bonus of a big, rabid fanbase. Of course, the mass and the degree of rabidness here are direct functions of popularity, and if you decide to work with a rather obscure title, the bonus reduces accordingly. On the other hand, this also sort of imposes a certain responsibility on the creators, as they are compelled to pander to the existing fanbase by way of peppering the flick with lots of fanservice, avoiding plot twists which would send the fans into a berserker rage, and so on. Choosing not to limit yourself with the guidelines set by the original work is akin to choosing not to play your half-orc as a barbarian. Feasible, but wasteful. The bigger the fanbase, the bigger the waste. So, there you have it, a double-edged sword.Arrow is a reimagination of the popular DC franchise, the Green Arrow. A reinvention of its rather famous characters and recreation of major story lines. And a whole other slew of new-age terms which mean,  Okay, we can still milk the heck out of this cow; all we gotta do is start with a story, tack names from the comics on our characters, and make stuff up as we go, calling this a Green Arrow adaptation all the way. May sound harsh, but the truth is, the producers decided to start out with a half-orc mage, and the characters and setting bear scant resemblance with the original comic, even after four seasons and all those comments over how they will grow closer to their classic counterparts as the series goes on. Apparently the producers thought they could do what Nolan did with Batman and tried to make a show based on classic superhero fantasy but without the fantasy. That obviously did not do, however; avoiding spoilers here, the series began including more and more surreal elements after the first season, so maybe that is what them creators meant by bringing the show closer to its roots. But this Oliver Queen still has nothing to do with the playful, charming Ollie the fans know and love. Due to all the brooding and grit, people compared him to Batman rather than Green Arrow. I call bogus. He straight-up started out as the Punisher. He is just barely growing out of it.So why 8 out of 10? Because it is jolly good fun. And suspense. The writing is not Shakespearean, but all these twists and turns and cliffhangers always keep you on your toes and make for an all-around entertaining experience. The flashbacks allow for organic character development, actually displaying why who is doing what at the present, making sense of decisions by showing where people come from, or even sometimes characters coming to understand the lesson the flashback scenes taught them back then. Coincidences may appear to come out of nowhere at times, though, but they are excusable for the most part, owing to the fact that every comicbook story needs the odd deus ex machina here and there. Dramatic conversations, however...well, the dialogue comes across intolerably cheesy and forced more often than not, prompting you to yell,  Oh, for the love of...  But then they go back to the action, and the action is pretty good. The production quality is on par with a typical action movie, and yes, I am talking theatrical release here.Faithfulness to the source material be damned; these folks are telling their own story and they are doing a darn good job about it. So if you are just interested in good old popcorn entertainment, promise yourself not to cry  What have they done to my Ollie? And where is the beard?!  and get on it. Oh, yeah. No beard. Sorry about that. Only a stubble. Does it count as a spoiler? Because I am not checking the spoiler tag just for the beard. ","8"
"Arrow",2016-05-10," Season 3 was mediocre, but season 4 has a huge drop in quality (shoutout to Marc  Franchise Slaughterer  Guggenheim). If you are a fan of the series, do yourself a favor and stop watching. The Flash is really hitting it's stride if you're desperate for CW superhero shows. This season of Arrow is just a crudely stitched together collection of tumblr fanfics. The characters have lost any real personality, and just serve to move the plot forward (this season is plagued by writers using half- baked concepts to push the  plot  forward by brute force). They frequently make decisions that defy any form of logic as well as any character traits of note. Any development that the characters have made in the past seasons has just disappeared, seemingly because they oppose Guggenheim's Mary Sue couple. Also it would be a misconception to think that the villain is the basis of any overarching plot. He's just a side note to said couple. Really this season seems to lack any direction whatsoever. It's like the writers are giving up on trying to provide any cohesive story. And to make it worse, while they could look back to some of the source material for some good ideas, they spit in its face in favor of their own rambling mess.As a side-note, I feel that the length of this show has been a huge detractor from the start. Even in it's glory days, the seasons probably could have been trimmed in half or lower and tell the same story. A lot of the time on this show is wasted on silly stuff, and could it could be a huge improvement to trim down the story to something more concise and save more for the effects budget. But honestly, is nobody in the studio checking up on them? Was this really looked at and approved by real people in the entertainment business? It boggles my mind that this could make it to air on such a well known show. The CW's superhero shows have always been aimed at a more  teeny  audience, but at the levels that Guggenheim has taken it to, it seems like he would be better off writing those fanfics and letting someone with moderate respect for the story's integrity take over. I love the actors in this and wish them the best, but the only hope I can see for this show is to retcon this season and get a fresh team of writers because this may be the biggest train wreck I have ever witnessed make the air.

"Arrow",2016-05-03," This is basically Batman Begins as a TV series, if Christian Bale used arrows and killed his enemies. The one reason that this show is not worse is the first season. The fact that he kills people during the first season definitely adds to it, and especially if you enjoy anti-hero dynamic, you will enjoy it. Some people may start to get emotionally evolved with the characters, some people may not. This TV show is really only for people who enjoy superhero movies before they watched this, and those who enjoy an antihero dynamic. The first season is the only reason this is a s high as a four. The rest of the show becomes EXTREMELY clique and standard, and it starts getting pretty stupid. Just watch the first season, save yourself the pain. ","4"
"Arrow",2016-05-01," ARROW is one of the best series i met with.those who watching just to watch how it is going they don't like it better. but those who watch it with interest it is the best show.i gone through all the seasons and episodes strictly speaking am kind of strongly addicted to this series the plot of the series is like all the series, to save a city from criminals.actually it is a parallel story series in which two stories of our hero ARROW (Oliver Queen) runs parallel. a story of present and a story past five years.he didn't possess any superpowers like any other comic superheroes. he has some extraordinary skills learned in past in that five years. there are many connections between the past and present stories in every episode.Sometimes FLASH and other superheroes are seen in ARROW.Finally,am about to tell that i love this series,and hope you will love it if you have understood the theme of this ARROW.#################GREEN ARROW################### ","9"
"Arrow",2016-04-28," Unfortunately, the writers have failed this show. Arrow used to be fantastic. I looked forward to it every week. Watched it as soon as it was out. Now I'm not sure I want to continue. Season 4 is the worst by a long shot. It's so bad that it's made me question whether I liked Arrow in the first place. Pretty sure I did. Seems like DC is really struggling to make a good show these days. Flash is still pretty good. Legends of Tomorrow is mediocre and I'm having a hard time caring about the characters. With Daredevil and Jessica Jones on the Marvel side, and Fantastic Four / Man of Steel / Batman v Superman / Supergirl on the DC side... I'm seeing just how far downhill DC has gone, while Marvel has gotten continually better (and had a good starting point).The writing in Arrow was good in s1-s3. By s4, it's just gotten cringeworthy. The whole Oliver/Felicity dynamic used to be pretty good. Now that takes about 80% of the attention of the show. It was good as a side-plot - worth about 5-10% of the plot. CW has turned it into a cringy romcom/drama. Not a superhero show.If the writers don't fix this show, I'm done, and so are countless other fans. Just look at the reactions to the last couple episodes. ","3"
"Arrow",2016-04-28," OK season 1 and 2 were good to great at times, was always on my list of  must watch  for the week, but these days its  if I miss a few I don't miss anything I liked Arrow when he was sort of Batman like, skill/shadows/using knowledge to overcome greater numbers or guns, but these days thats long gone, they just walk down streets in the open, and there is a whole bunch of them on the team now.Its more like Robin Hood and his merry men, where in the past he might get away with moving quite and in shadow, this lot run all over, jump openly in front of bad guys...the list goes on.The Flash nails it, he has his team but they are the brains, very few times they will take point, 90% of the time its Barry, it works well that way, not having a whole troop follow you around (most of who pull of the same stuff as the Arrow without the training he went through....League blah blah..not all)For me they need to ditch half the team, have him do solo stuff more, odd team up, focus on Arrow and his skill, and speaking to others who watch the show, many feel the same.

"Arrow",2016-04-26," I'm writing a 'spoiler free' review, so don't worry guys!!!Season 1 :Rating - 10/10S1 was full of action-packed stuff and was fun. It has lots of plot twists and the actors have done a good job in depicting their respective characters with a convincing plot. In short , Season 1 of Arrow is worth watching. Season 2 :Rating - 10/10S2 carries the same action packed sequences with a more interesting plot and it thrills the viewers. Again, the ending was convincing and I personally feel season 2 had the best villain. Again, its worth a watch.Season 3 :Rating - 8.5/10After expecting a lot from the hit series, I was disappointed after watching the 3rd season. The fight sequences became sloppy and boring. Even though, the main plot is as thrilling as ever, You can basically feel they are dragging it to finish it in the end. Last 3 episodes were fun so I have nothing to say about that. But in some episodes, I felt that the action packed series changed into a soap opera, considering the lot of crying, a character blaming him/herself for many things and some other character convincing him/her that its not their fault. It gets sloppy .... I was so disappointed after watching this season. But I couldn't stop it because I always believed that the 4th season could be better like the other seasons. Season 4Rating - 7.5/10After the disappointment from the 3rd season, I expected some new action from the fourth season. BUT, The plot is boring as hell, I wonder whether they follow the actual comic story. Every episode is boring, with too many fillers. Fight sequences - rubbish. OK , not totally rubbish, but it's bad ... I think 19 episodes released till now... There was hardly any plot in this season. Heard they are making a Season 5 for this show... Again, I hope they make it better this time... I don't believe in third chances.I recommend DC fans to watch this show. For casual viewers who want some entertaining plot, you'll do fine with the first two seasons.and for people who watch 'the flash' or 'legends of tomorrow' or both, it'll be a good watch because those three are inter-connected with the characters and the plot. ","6"
"Arrow",2016-04-19," First, I want to start off this review by saying that I was a loyal DC Comics fan when I was younger so I tend to show favoritism to shows that stay true to the comics. The first 2 seasons of this show were great. Of course there were some filler episodes as is the case with shows that run a full length of 23 episodes in a season. One of the reasons why the miniseries format on Cable and streaming services are of higher quality- less episodes so the writers can be more creative and don't have to spend 23 episodes to build to a conclusion at the end of the season. But even with all those challenges, Arrow was able to be a GREAT show with all those episodes for the first 2 seasons. At the beginning of season 3, the writers lost themselves. It seems as if their creativity ran out and plot lines and episode villains were recycled. The desperation of these writers to gain back the respect of their audience has lead to departure of lead characters which surely had tarnished this show's quality forever. This show is currently on season 4 and I truly believe there is no going back. I give this show a 6 because the first 2 seasons deserved a 9 out of 10 because of the quality- the last 2 seasons deserved a 4. You can make the argument that Arrow was the show that paved the way for shows like Daredevil, The Flash, and Jessica Jones because of the quality in the first 2 seasons. That is no longer the case. What a shame... ","6"
"Arrow",2016-04-18," It is one of the stupidest series ever, first 2 seasons are good but as you start with 3 rd season it feels like some stupid kid has written the script. its so stupid you almost laugh on the characters. The most stupid character is the white cannery, you just wish that that dumb girl wouldn't have been in the series. please refrain your see Lt from this stupid hero series. there are many better series to watch on. avoid this monotonous season. if you wanna see a comedy series you might opt for it. it has hilarious, dumbest,and stupidest characters ever in a super hero franchise. oliver queen you have failed my expectations. hahaha xoxoxoxo.

"Arrow",2016-04-17," its not just reference to laurel's death . they keep killing every1 like its some GTA going on . and killing a black canary ?? are u kidding me ?? just because killing a villain is straightforward doesn't mean u can the most important member of cast. THIS SHOW DIED WHEN RA'S AL GHUL KILLED OLIVER QUEEN  ever since , they are just stretching it like anything. island story is f***ed up by baron rieter. i mean it was soo cool when DEATHSTROKE was there. soooo original !!! and now everything tossed to garbage . IF U CANT RUN THE SHOW THEN Don't ! a main superhero u killed , that too by some F***er whose powers are like a 9 yr old fantasy boy. not to mention his comic alias is also nearly = 0 . i see why people like this show .....  MADE BY IDIOTS FOR IDIOTS  <U+FEFF> ","10"
"Arrow",2016-04-09," This review does contain spoilers!!!!!!!!! It's was tolerable up until season for and that's when things get unrealistic and there were always stuff like that but it did't annoy me enough to stop watching it. But in season for episode 19 when they killed off laurel lance and she isn't coming back just made me really mad. I have decided i will give it one more chance but if Damian dark doesn't die I'm gonna stop watching the show for good.They also lead a big secret to season five which I'm not even gonna watch which really annoys me and it wasn't even realistic how she died she was fine then she said something than she went into cardiac arrest and the doctor tried CPR for thirty seconds and then gave up without using the defibrillator a second time ","1"
"Arrow",2016-04-09," I loved season 1 and 2 - the characters were good, the plot was decent and the series was simply very enjoyable. However, with the dawn of season 3 the story started straying from the path of superhero show and became more of a soap instead. The characters lost meaning, we saw more and more forced relationship drama, characters got killed then resurrected then killed again - the writing is a total mess now. The writers seem to focus on all the wrong things while making the story into an unredeemable trainwreck of an adaptation. Hell, actually, I can't with clean conscience call it an adaptation now, because it just borrows character names - everything else got changed too much, to the point of not being recognizable anymore. This isn't Green Arrow - this feels more like horrible fanfiction.Show needs more competent writers who don't think people watch only for  will they, won't they  - that's extremely annoying.I don't know what happened between season 2 and 3 but the drop in quality is just astounding - the plot doesn't make sense, the characters are simply ridiculous. Make it stop. ","5"
"Arrow",2016-04-07," I really loved this show in season 1 and 2. The show started out as a good show in season 1, and got a lot better in season 2 with Deathstroke. Season 2 even had Deadshot and the Suicide Squad, which I loved. There were a lot of Easter eggs for comic book fans, and the show was good for both casual fans and comic book fans. Then came season 3, and things went downhill. It was not all bad. They introduced Ray Palmer (The Atom), and that was cool. But they butchered his character, making him seem like and Iron Man knockoff, giving him a super suit that can fly, and can shoot blasts of whatever they're calling it. What they should have done was give him a suit that ONLY allows him to shrink and be basically Ant-Man (comic book fans know that Ant-Man is an Atom ripoff). But instead, they made him Iron Man who can also shrink. That's number one. Number two is the League of Assassins. While I love Nyssa, using the League takes the show from a borderline Batman ripoff to full on Batman. And then there is  Olicity . Putting Oliver and Felicity together is just fan service to the casual fans who wrote fan fics for  Olicity . And then in Season 4. The big bad that may make me stop watching the show. Killing Laurel. They butchered her character by making her unlikable in season 1, and making her sister the Black Canary instead of her, is an insult to the comics. They wouldn't even give her her actual powers, instead making it into a weak choker necklace that she rarely uses. Then they kill her. Just by stabbing her with an arrow. Killing her off means they should change the name and remove the DC brand, because this is no longer a Green Arrow show. Bottom line: Watch season 1 and 2, maybe parts of season three, since it wasn't all bad. But don't watch season 4. No matter who you are. It's bad writing, and a disservice to the comics. ","6"
"Arrow",2016-04-04," It really hurts giving the show such a low rating cause it doesn't do justice to the first and second season. I miss the feelings that were generated after each episode ending. You couldn't wait for the week to pass so that you can get your fix again :P. Nowadays the show is like Gossip Girl with masks. Please stop with the stupid puns and introduce real villains to the show (DCU provides endless choices), and by all means KILL FELICITY OFF...I believe I speak on behalf of all the fans when I say that this show must go back to its original darker style.I hope this change comes soon after the  promised  death of a character this season. ","5"
"Arrow",2016-04-03," Arrow is a very good show initially. Sure the acting is not always great, and a few of the characters are annoying, but until about mid 2nd-season this is very entertaining and has great character development. But thereafter... oh my... If you want a good show, stop watching after the 2nd season. If you, on the other hand, want to see pretty much every character on the show running around with a bow and fighting bad guys after 2 weeks of training without getting shot every 2sec, then you might like the rest as well. In this show you, as a woman, can go to the gym and practice boxing for a few weeks and then you are ready to fight grown men by the dozen. And this is not the only premise which is ridiculous to say the least. The show still produce one or two episodes which are good, also after season two, but in general the show becomes so boring and so predictable and get so many plot-holes it is hard to see its the same show. Only a few guest appearances by The Flash and a few scenes here and there keep the spirit up. Also on this show they cannot die. Someone get a sword through their chest? Well throw them into this puddle of water and whamowhamo they are beating up bad guys again. Someone explodes? No worries! Its all fine. Stabbed to death in prison? Pfff, thats nothing, just get up and shake it off... In the beginning of the show it was exciting and although you sort of know the heroes will pull through, it is never a certain, they even lose once in a while. But keep watching and you suddenly know that even a dull pointless character that really should have died in prison, actually survives and comes back later.I still have some hope for Arrow. It can still turn things around, but if not I really hope the next season is the last because the show has been dying slowly for a couple of years now. Personally I love the basic gang from season 1 plus the Thea Queen character, the rest should just die in some horrible attack which would rejuvenate the show, bring some excitement back and give us a feel of dread again. Oh, and Oliver should stop dreaming and flashing back to that stupid island by now. Every single episode, even as the show goes on, he flashes back to his Robinson Crusoe days. Stop it please! ","5"
"Arrow",2016-03-13," Well I like this series Arrow.its so funny,Its full of good actors and the plot is alright.Anyways,there's something I hate about this series.I mean,I'm with the person I know(e.g.Oliver Queen,I know him,he's my friend.I look at his face(e.g facial hair, and lips everyday)but when he's wearing a hood,which only covers his forehead,I won't be able to know/see who he is.He has the same facial hair,but I won't see that he's Oliver Queen.Again,I have a daughter(Laurel),I know her because I look at her face(e.g eyes) everyday but when she wearing a mask which does not cover anything at all,I won't be able to see and/or know that that is my daughter I'm talking to.That's so stupid.I was going give this series a rating of 10/10,but I'm giving it a 5 because I subtracted a 5 from 10 because of what I wrote above.So if you thinking of watching.Don't.But if you got nothing else to watch,watch Arrow.The series is funny but kinda stupid. ","5"
"Arrow",2016-03-11," ARROW = AWESOME.This isn't about a superhero this is about a hero which means that he does not have any super powers like many others have . This can be seen by an adult or a teen . There are many twists and suspense s .Stephan Amell had done great stunts .This TV series is and action packed adventure one . And once again ARROW = AWESOME. Accordin to me this is the best TV Series I have ever seen. John Barrowman have also given excellent performance. Emily Bett Rickards ,without any doubt have also performed well.This is indeed an excellent TV Series for a newbie or a pro.Susanna Thompson is also given some amazing performance. ","10"
"Arrow",2016-03-07," After Smallville I approached Arrow with great caution. However this turned out to be a very all around TV series, much more evolved than Smallville in terms of quality of the production. The hero is not perfect, he learns and develops. Flashbacks are much more than a glimpse of past, they keep you wondering and the way writers tie past and present events is masterful. Stephen Amell is not only a great action star but his mimics and tone of his voice really gets to you. You can clearly see the difference of his tone when he is the  Arrow  and when he was the kid before the island. Even the main villains like Slade Wilson, Malcom Meryln and Ra'as are quite likable characters. The only irritating part in this series is Katie Cassidy's performance on Laurel. I'm not sure if the writers are deliberately portraying her like this but I'm very happy that Oliver Queen was not stuck with her as a lover for the rest of the series. ","9"
"Arrow",2016-02-28," I have been just watching some episodes from season 3. The obtrusively repeated  torture is necessary  formula makes one ask, weather the CIA is cosponsoring the series. The repeated  we are here to keep the city save from terrorism  and  torture is a necessary evil to do just that  leaves a foul taste in ones mouth. Considering it comes from a country which terrorizes the world with war while financing and training the terrorists they are claiming to fight as a pretext to invade oil rich countries, this series is a picture book of propaganda. The characters are a bit hollow too and the hero is - of course - your good neighborhood billionaire of the 0.001 percent. While real billionaires have gazillion of lobbyists doing their biding and politicians waiting in the lobby for there paycheck, this peculiar billionaire is playing with bow and arrows and is doing the torturing without CIA aid all by himself. Nice pictures for dumbed down though in the Nighted States. ","1"
"Arrow",2016-02-24," I would love this show, except that it regularly gives a dose of incredibly bad  moral  lessons. The latest came with episode 15 of season 4. Felicity finds out that Oliver has a son from a previous relationship, something he didn't tell her because the birth mother demanded that he keep it a secret for everyone else, to shelter the child (William) from Oliver's tumultuous life. Oliver's been through hell and back to prove himself to his friend and his fiancée, and still that's not enough - she can't  marry  him. It's all Oliver's fault. He's the  bad  guy and everyone's expected to attain to a standard of perfection, that of course nobody in the show lives up to. Ridiculous. And the degree of Felicity's selfishness in all things Oliver is really quite obscene and disgusting.Well, one less show to watch. Too much with the BS! ","1"
"Arrow",2016-02-20," With the recent release of season 4, I was going in hoping for some great new incite into the character Arrow.The first 3 seasons were surprisingly good and I loved the back story showing how he became 'The Green Arrow'.Alas it's starting to take a dive for the worse. Firstly the whole Felicity relationship/trust and all that nonsense is really wearing thin and getting in the way of what could be a far better story. PLEASE throw it out. At least her misfortune made for an interesting twist as the character was making me want to throw something through the screen.Secondly the flash back scenes are not tying in well with the episodes and are becoming more of a random filler than integral parts of the main story.Thirdly, the fight scenes are becoming boring. They seem so over staged and ridiculous there's almost no point in having them. I was overjoyed that the league was dissolved as the whole angry daughter of Ryule was becoming monotonous.Here's hoping Season 5 can get back to the ground work days of Seasons 1 and 2. Those really had me getting into the character. Now I think the problem is there focusing to heavily on the characters around our main hero and this is detracting from the core element of the show.Also, I know many will not like this but they need to have characters die and stay dead. Bringing them back is getting cheesy. It's not exactly going to be shocking if a character dies anymore as there's a good chance they will miraculously just re-appear in a future episode.Think 'Game Of Thrones'. The deaths of characters you like shock you and they don't come back which adds to the story.Essentially any believability with realism has been thrown out the window for a terrible Cosplay like inferior imitation. The whole, make all the women right all the time and the guy is just a person who makes all the mistakes really gets on my nerves and is anti-equalitarian. It's sexist against men and doesn't make for smart drama at all.To conclude I'm giving the overall series so far a 6 where as until Season 4 it would have scored a 9. This mirror's Episodes 1,2 and 3 of the Star Wars movies. Essentially I wish they had never made Season 4 of Arrow, it's ruined a great series.Holding hope for Season 5 but if it's got more of the same, where in for a forgettable show. ","6"
"Arrow",2016-02-13," I absolutely love everything about this show. This show has inspired me to be an actor and how Stephen Amell portrays oliver queen, I think is one of the most outstanding performances off all acting. My dream is to one day be apart of the DC universe.I really can not say enough how much bringing Diggle into the arrow as the leader/voice of reason is truly amazing. The storyline for all seasons so far has been fantastic (if you really concentrate and focus on them and the flash backs). The way this one show has also made two more shows because of there success explains why you need to watch it. The flash and legends of tomorrow have been absolutely fundamental as well. I can not wait too see if they are planning on bringing Batman, Night wing, Aqua man, and whoever else. ","10"
"Arrow",2016-02-13," I really liked the first season of Arrow. It was a dark show about  superheroes  wandering the street and delivering justice. It was something that Smallville could not be. Grounded, believable. Had some of the soap opera feel, but it was toned down to an acceptable level. After the first season many of the better parts including the high body count started to retreat into the background. I always held Flash to a lower standard due to its more  One Tree Hill  approach to the story, but ultimately as of the time of my writing Arrow hit the all-time low for me, as I am now struggling to watch it while I have a decent time with the latest episodes of the speedster. Unfortunately, I do not think Flash got smarter or better, it is just the fact that it is consistent, I always get the stuff that I expect. I have to look away when those cheesy moments come up. In the fourth season of Arrow they introduced supernatural elements to the story. Seems like they needed something like meta-humans to stay attractive. While I am mostly settled with the presence of Damian Darhk, I cannot fathom the fact that they are resurrecting long dead people. Resurrected story lines are almost as ridiculous as the fetish to make everyone related to the main characters meta-human, a criminal or just simply not normal. I understand that these shows are for young adults basically, but I still cannot believe that something should be this much predictable and stupid. Also, the new island stuff is laughable, it does not add anything valuable or new. And of course they needed to write the now canceled Constantine into the show. ","6"
"Arrow",2016-02-13," I have tried and tried to love this show, as I was a long time DC fan, but boy does the writing leave a lot to be desired. Great cast, I don't blame them. The star is impressive, super beefcakey for the girls I guess, really impressive climbing pull ups... the overview is good... vigilante story turning a corner. Silly is the only word I can use to describe the direction that it did turn down. Groups attacking a city to that degree and the National Guard doesn't get a chance to help. Surely a few costumed archers can save the day though. Earthquake machines, secret islands, the Lazarus pit seems the least of the oddities, but sure, it can bring life to the dead with only minor PTSD.The recent fight scene with Raz Al Gul was so incredibly disappointing and unrealistic, I nearly barfed. I far more enjoyed the batman cartoon's version of the league of assassins, who, initially were more than any one of our Arrow heroes could deal with, but now they seem to be able to knock them down like bowling pins.I know that this stuff is fantasy, but silly is what it's turning out as. As in the Flash, the actors are NOT the problem, the writers are just sub-par. The show is feeling far too formulaic, and the actions of most of the characters are just unrealistic.  if you let me out of this prison cell, I'll give you this rock I'm holding in my hand through the bars .Please try to write something slightly not lame... I really want to enjoy the DC universe as much as I am Marvel. ","3"
"Arrow",2016-02-11," This is not a bad series but not the best either. I gave it 5 stars for the simple reason of it not being original, trying to turn Green Arrow into more like Batman by using Batman's arch villains and the teen titans arch villains, and trying to make Oliver Queen more brooding like Bruce Wayne. Plus using one of the plot lines from Batman's history and using it for Green Arrow's was about sickening for me. Check out the end of season 3.Then there is flash back scenes that happen like every few minutes tends to be annoying. The multiple girl friend drama and the other excess drama tended to be writers block and ended up being filler to make the episode last for the entire duration.Now since I got that off my chest, if you know nothing about the comics then you might enjoy the series if you can get past the excess drama and half of the episodes being flashbacks. ","5"
"Arrow",2016-01-08," Another Comic Book Superhero show that gets high ratings because... its a comic book superhero. People are easily entertained, and by the 8+ stars this show had on IMDb there's no reason for Hollywood to change a thing. You can throw any piece of superhero garbage out there and people love it. I honestly believe if you made a comic book called The Hot Dog people would watch it.The Hot Dog is about a guy (Timmy Frankfurter) who works in a meat processing plant. The cooperate CEO's are having the lab work on a new meat preservative that the FDA is unaware of and has not been tested, but could make the company hugely more profitable. They accidentally leave some of the new preservative laying around and Timmy is accidentally injected. The preservative disfigures him, resembling a walking, talking wiener, but in turn, makes Timmy preserved himself, rendering him impervious to anything but fire. The Hot Dog shoots a relish like substance from his nose that sticks to anything it touches, thwarting any oncoming attack. Or he blows an onion-like gas out of his ears that burns peoples eyes, basically incapacitating them....Now, I understand that makeup and CGI will have to work on a Man/Hot Dog with ears and a nose, but I'm telling you people would watch it. Just put in a couple outlandish-looking weapons, 2 or three big explosions each episode, and finally (of course) 2 hot girls making out and I guarantee 3/4 of the reviewers would give it 8-10 stars. They'd write crappy reviews like,  Original. I was entertained and strangely hungry throughout the entire show.  or,  I felt for the Hot Dog and his inner battles. It reminded me of my battles choosing between ketchup and mustard...  I once heard someone say that people will applaud anything, and it is so true. People are entertained because they think they were supposed to be entertained... People, it is okay to actually think.BTW, If anyone wants to by the rights to The Hot Dog, please contact my agent.So, to my long awaited Arrow review.... It sucks! ","1"
"Arrow",2016-01-08," Arrow is successfully disappointing in every aspect that I could think of: (big spoiler alert!!! )1.Directing- The scenes are poorly directed. Lets start from the poor performance of the characters which I believe could have done better with another director. For example Oliver (the Arrow) is believed to be dead for 5 years, when he comes back home from the dead he get a soft hug from his sister (Really??? a hug ??? you could think he went on a bushiness trip and came back), don't get me wrong I'm not looking for much emotions in this series but this is a poor understanding of the situation. Other then the performance the scenes are just not professionally filmed! another strong example is at one of the scenes Oliver is talking with his mother not arguing of fighting but using cold sentences to each other) and all of a sudden his sister ,which observed them from far distance, claim that they had a fight (OK maybe she can read their lips). there are so many scenes that I can give you but you got the point and I should continue to the next thing. Second thing which keeps going all the time is that the Arrow is using arrows and his enemies using guns,automatic weapons and they keep missing the target.As far as I can tell the arrow doesn't have a super dodge ability, and it seemed too lame that police officers, S.W.A.T teams and special forces soldier all miss the Arrow and even the camera angle doesn't let you thing that there is a far distance between them (oh God this is insulting). Third thing is that many time the Arrow is hunting some evil guy and they seem to miraculously disappear right in front of him!! (OK maybe he is not that a sharp hero).2.Plot development- OK this even worse the the poor directing. for a whole season Oliver is murdering people who allegedly corrupted the city.He is the judge and the executioner (Ok this will change as the series goes). but what really bothers me is that most of the characters around the Arrow doesn't seem to worry about the killing spree .Only 2 characters does, and only at a very late part of the series. Another thing is that there are 3-4 enemies that keep come back at the first and second season. I love when a character is suddenly comes back to the series but this is happening too many time!! with the same characters !! come on the DC universe has plenty of villains, use them! Another is that the Arrow identity isn't kept as secret as you expect, at some point everyone knows who is the Arrow except new villains. One last thing that shows again how the plot is poorly developed is that the characters had done some terrible things one to another (cheating, lying, kidnapping,drugging, murdering ) but they somehow in an unreasonable way forgive each other or even worse - help each other (!?!?). I could keep on criticizing this series and keep on with the spoilers (the big one is at middle of season 3 which I decided not to mention here) but if you read this far you probably make up your mind already so Ill save you from more spoilers/criticizing .2 good things I have to say about the Arrow (the reason why I rate it 3/10 and not 1/10) 1.The connection to the DC comic world by joining interesting character to the series (especially joining forces with another TV series. A step I think had never been seen before on the screen). but this happened too late I suppose to save this poor series. you probably ask yourself why I keep watching this series, only to understand another good, amazing, thrilling and Flashing series. 2. Villains that are though enough to beat down the arrow - this is comes only at the middle of season 2 and season 3 but it surely add a lot to the emptiness of this series . and of course the Arrow ridiculously defeat them somehow thanks to the director.In a sentence - this series could have been much greater, but it managed to be a disaster (i.e the Arrow character at Smallville was way much better). this is a real insult to your intelligence. think twice before staring to watch this big disappointment. ","3"
"Arrow",2016-01-07," A lot of the reviews for the show say that Arrow isn't any good because it's repetitive, unoriginal, poorly-scripted, etc., and I completely disagree. THIS SHOW IS ABOUT HOW OLIVER QUEEN BECOMES THE GREEN ARROW. It's meant to be an origins story, so I agree when people say the characters (especially Oliver) make the same mistakes more than once, but it's supposed to be that way. This show is meant to portray how Oliver Queen went from being consumed by darkness (as Arrow) to being a symbol of hope for Star City (as Green Arrow). Oliver has a really messed up background, and this story tries to explain how he overcame his definite trust issues and overbearing protectiveness to BECOME A HERO. I never read the comics or anything like that, but my main reason for loving this show is because of the character evolution. It's crazy to watch the current season and go back to watch the first episodes of season 1 because the show is so incredibly different now. Oliver has gone from being a murderer to becoming a hero, and that means the tone of the show has changed entirely. Something else you have to remember when watching this show is that it's television. Every show (especially the ones on the cw) needs drama to survive. You have to keep the show interesting, and the characters have to be doing something new every season, or it'll get stale. So far, the writers have done a pretty good job at this. They do recycle old material ever now and then, but they've done an okay job so far. I will admit that the first couple seasons had a lot of filler episodes, but so far in season 4, there haven't been many (if any at all) that didn't directly go back to main big bad of the season. There have been a couple that were meant to set up the new show Legends of Tomorrow that I could have lived without though.I will agree with other viewers when they say the show can be inconsistent because there are a couple of things that tend to get annoying. Like Laurel Lance. The character doesn't serve any purpose that someone else can't fill, and I'm still trying to figure out how she got so good at fighting within like 5 episodes. And is she even a lawyer anymore? Things like this are why I couldn't give the show all 10 stars. All in all, though, Arrow is one of my favorites, and I'll continue to watch it until the series finale. ","8"
"Arrow",2016-01-03," If you want to watch something entertaining, captivating and exciting then you must watch this. But keep in mind this show does not fully satisfy the most solid-reasoning demanding minds because there are events lacking logical explanations that make this show somewhat inconsistent.If it was not for these flaws, I would admire this show more, but even so this is worth the opportunity to be watched for one or two episodes to make your own opinion.The acting is good, not great but delivers what is supposed to. However, the actresses involved in fights should be more fit if we are expected to give more credibility.Most of the fighting moves are better than for example Daredevil (which is quite great overall) but there are still some moves that need to be practiced more.Production is OK for the budget but I would like to see more realistic explosions not those Power-Rangers-like sparks.I want to recognize and thank the writers and everybody involved in this show because I think it is not easy to entertain us watchers for 4 seasons so far and have good ratings.

"Arrow",2016-01-02," In season one the Arrow is just a murderer, plain and simple. The acting is bad, the characters are bad and unrealistic, it's pretty much a soap opera.He has an  enlightenment  by the end of S01 for no apparent reason (much like Ben Affleck in daredevil) so at least that part gets better by season two, since he stops murdering people, but almost nothing else changes. The acting is still cringeworthy, the characters are still pulled straight out of Santa Barbara. I don't know why I stuck with the show until halfway through season 3, but I did and it doesn't get any better.The action is fun I guess so the show has going for it but other than that, it's really no good (it's certainly not an 8.1 in my book).

"Arrow",2015-12-31," Great...Really Great in TV Series World...Only 1 Star is less because of this described below...But Why this Great story has unbelievable behavioral pattern. It is obviously feel that even matured superhero keeps secret a thing which he should not and gets result as worst And also accept after every time that I should have told earlier (Most spoken Dialog after You have failed This City Dialog in Whole Season). Lets think its okay for 1st time but frequently after this he is doing same mistake which is mismatch to matured character (Even Child can learn that this should not be done again). Also Laurel & Thea making mistakes every time and didn't learn things from their mistakes which is also feeling an Idiot to me watching this And in this scenario Arrow knows what is right and wrong and even after he forgives and not doing any precautions or making strict steps which must be required like it was a child's mistake. Make it real if you have such a great story and Superhero. Arrow can't be loser in this normal action after surviving 5 Years. Everyone keeps secret from each other and also alleging each other when others secret comes out. They are not children to unable to evaluate this even by series of experiences. Laurel & Thea are always making things worse and Arrow is not learning from this or even doesn't try to them not doing again. ","9"
"Arrow",2015-12-20," Entertaining at first simply because we all want to know what happened on the island and how he managed to survive but they show us slowly, teasing with bits and pieces of the past that will either intrigue you or cause you to give up on knowing. I understand that it's part of the  mystery , not revealing the entire 5 years of his disappearance but it's starting to feel as if they are keeping us in the dark so they can use the past to introduce whatever crazy plot or storyline at any given time.There's action and entertainment I will admit but later it gets so repetitive that you will be able to guess the outcome before it happens. Also, there's the irony of him always  lying to protect  his loved ones in which , the lies cause more damage than the actual truth. Half of the bad things that happened wouldn't have had he just revealed his identity. Entertaining on a Sunday with no cable ","5"
"Arrow",2015-12-18," As a Chinese, I have to say the Chinese people (except the Sichuan restaurant guy) are FAKE Chinese. The Chinese accent from them makes me feel disgusting.

"Arrow",2015-12-15," Major Spoilers Ahead!Only up to the 2nd season...so far 1/4 of the show is about childish tantrums and drama worthy of a soap opera. At least the whining was covered by both sexes in the first season, but with the death of the stooge Tommy (good riddance) most of the whining comes from the female characters (except Sara). Moira's slightly condescending reaction to her daughter professing love ( I love Roy ) summarizes the feelings about the inane subplots: Roy who? I said  stfu Thea  out loud at least once every episode in the second season.The best part of the show is the flashback plot that explains Oliver's time on the island. The villains aren't always a hit (The Count), but most of them are portrayed well enough both in writing and acting. ","6"
"Arrow",2015-12-15," i love this show so much season 3 was my personal favorite because of the story lines but all 4 are amazing. If you are looking for a good action, adventive, drama, sci-fi show then 'Arrow' is the show for you,also if you like 'Arrow' then you should watch 'The Flash' because they cross over and have good story lines. In the show there is an amazing romance between 'Oliver' and 'Felicity' there ship name is 'Olicity' i think they are an amazing couple and have shipped them since the beginning of the shoe when Felicity was first introduced. 'Roy' and 'Thea' also have an amazing relation ship and both join Oliver's team to help fight 'Slade Wilson' and 'Deathstokes' 'Mirakuru' soldiers. ","10"
"Arrow",2015-12-07," 1. Okay, I'm a guy that LOVES to sleep around, but the characters in this show sleep around so much it makes the girls look like total sluts. Every time Thea or Felicity or Laurel gets to meet a new character introduced into the show, they are asked out on a date and end the date humping2. So much inconsistency. At one point, two characters are best of friends / family and nothing on earth can break that bond, then next minute they're enemies. Seriously, I think the writers are 5 year olds on crack to write a show like this.3. EVERYONE becomes a super hero. The main character's lover, ex- lover, sister, hell even the next door neighbor's dog becomes a super hero (okay that last one's a joke but seriously...) Is it really that easy to become a semi-invincible god like fighter? And what is up with all the female fighters? I mean I'm not sexist or anything but please at least choose women who can do the choreography right. When Laurel Lance fights... it is... absurd to say the least. You can literally see her doing the  girly girl swing  with her punches. If they chose Ronda Rousey to do the action scenes, at LEAST the fights would be memorable, but the producers messed that up too.4. In summary, this is the most absurd, bad action, bad acting, stupidly put storyline TV show I've EVER watched, and I'ved watched TV for over 36 years, in 8 different countries. ","1"
"Arrow",2015-12-07," Fantastic show. I always look for solid character development in every movie or TV show regardless of genre and this show definitely brings it. The action scenes are great, don't get me wrong and I am sure that a majority of the audience is in it for those scenes. And the story line is likewise fantastic. However, what really hooks me is the constant traits of friendship and sacrifice that is prevalent in the show. Each member of the team would offer themselves as a sacrifice for one another time and time again. Even in Season 3 when all hope seems lost, Oliver is still trying to save his friends lives in exchange for his own life. Over all, I love the show. ","10"
"Arrow",2015-12-06," This show is amazing! The actors are great, a lot of great scenes, a lot of people were q tiny bit disappointed by the 3rd season (i am not one of them) but clearly they are not anymore thanks to this amazing 4th season! I love the story, the crossovers, the fight scenes, keep up the good work! Every time I watch an episode i cannot wait for the next week to watch the next one. I love Arrow, Stephen Amell is one of my top idols with his acting, him being a hero on TV and in real life (F*ck Cancer) and his amazingly perfect body...I wish I can meat you one day. I also cannot wait to watch TMNT 2! Please keep Arrow going for as many seasons as you can. *SPOILER ALERT* Try to shoot scenes that only involve OTA (Original Team Arrow) more often just like you did in an episode in season 4 that i adored!Thank you! ","10"
"Arrow",2015-11-30," I really do not understand how this show has an 8.1 average. Sometimes it is so difficult to fathom how the writers came up with such a clichéd TV series. Now don't get me wrong, I am all about clichés and cheesy dialogues but this show has taken all of those aspects to a whole new level with an extra strong added ingredient of  stupid .For example, Sara Lance comes back to Starling City, and just because she wears a tiny eye mask, her own sister cannot tell it's her? And what's with the cheesy  Mirakuru ? It would have sounded much less cheesier if they had called it  The miracle drug  or something like that.Another example, is when Thea Queen get's kidnapped by Slade. If you get  KIDNAPPED , you'd be fearing for your life. I mean did Thea know that Slade was not going to kill her when she was first abducted? She would have been quaking in her boots and traumatized, to say the LEAST. Yet when she is let go, the only thing she can dwell on is the fact that Oliver didn't tell her the truth about her father? Really? Wouldn't she just be happy that she  STILL HAS HER OWN LIFE ?Things like this keep bothering the hell out of me, and the ONLY reason I watch this show (albeit while biting down on my tongue), is because I want to know how the story fits with The Flash, and all the good TV shows have been watched already.If you don't care about whether a TV show makes sense, or care about storyline, or decent action, then go ahead and watch it, but for me... I'm awestruck at how stupid a show they can make.Some GOOD TV shows I can recommend:- Person of Interest- Da Vinci's Demons- The Blacklist- The Flash ","2"
"Arrow",2015-11-29," I actually enjoyed the first season of this show. I can suspend disbelief for any fantasy that is reasonable( zombies in Walking Dead that can be killed just with a spike to the brain? No problem). I even could overlook the unlikely fact that Oliver becomes a world champion ninja warrior on the island. But then came the real insult to our intelligence. We are expected to believe that his skinny kid sister (Thea) and even skinnier ex girlfriend (Laurel) can become amazing ninja superheroes with just a few months of training sessions. Suddenly they can beat most beafy badass men in a fight??? WTF???? Why is no one talking about this???Fail That's when you lost me. Sorry ","2"
"Arrow",2015-11-29," Except for its first season the show is no more any hero story just pathetic sex and city type and while reaching 4th season only thing that remains is killing and resurrecting lead roles.It makes you even on an account of thinking about your time and money waste.Much sillier plots can have amazing show but this gives no intention to watch further. Why do you just have to revolve story around silly natters of relation among the lead roles instead of a hero doing at least a bit productive.It's just a silky drama for people to watch and cry until no reason has left in them.No thrill or action just a story of a man of who is rotating among his friends and family problems and has no time for good action. ","2"
"Arrow",2015-11-27," OK this series is a whole lot better than any TV shows I've seen. This a thrilling TV show and very catchy. Just get through half of season one and you will love it. I love the how they leave you thinking of how people knew Oliver before he came back from the  dead . I'm currently watching it on Netflix and can't wait till season 4 gets out on Netflix. Love this show cause it is somewhat realistic. It can come true. You just need to be a really good archer and need to be good at everything that Oliver queen is on this show. I hope the Arrow series will continue on for 6 seasons. I guarantee if you like watching action shows you will love this show. ","10"
"Arrow",2015-11-27," I somehow endured 3 seasons of this, just because I had nothing to watch. It's not even THAT bad if you think about main story line, just a relaxing show, everything is pretty mediocre, but the main problem here is... Fillers. 23 episodes each season, about 7-8 of them are actually tied to the main story line, rest of the episodes they're dealing with maniacs, serial killers, robbers, drug dealers etc. It's totally pointless, cause you always know who will win and you always know that no one from the  good guys  will be seriously hurt/die in the process. Later it gets even worse - they're re-using same filler characters, they magically resurrecting, escaping from prison and other bs, but at least you're aware right at the start of an episode that it's going to be a lousy filler yet again.Really don't understand why they need to make 23 episodes each season when most of them filled with stuff like I described above. It's really painful to watch and kills any amount of hype so that you don't even care about main story anymore. ","2"
"Arrow",2015-11-25," This series is really not my kind of stuff : it's clearly make for teenagers.  Heroes  that can rebirth, killed but never dead, injured and wounded but always standing still, etc... I have seen the 3 first seasons because of my ex-flame was watching it every Wednesday (at 11.30 PM!) when it was aired in France on TF1. I was so bored watching this thing I often fell asleep in front of the episodes ! I just don't get the point. Superheroes series can be well-made. But this one is so dumb. If you like it, well it's just fine. But I really don't and I won't see the 4th season when it'll be aired in France next summer ! And please, the acting !!! Come on ! Start acting, not taking poses for the cameras ! I think why the producers chose Amell is only for his good looks. Not because he's a good actor... And the series... Season after season, we always have the same scripts coming from the first season's episodes ! Arrow wins, Arrow loses... He wins, he looses... He wins, he loooses... Someone died ! He wins, he looooses... He wins, he loooooses... He wins, he looooooses... Oops, another one died ! He wins, he loooooooses... He wins, he looooooooses... He wins, he loooooooooses... He wins, he... OH my Goash : I see Dead People !!! OK, Arrow is still alive... But for me, this TV-Series is already dead.Arrow ? Never more for me ! ","3"
"Arrow",2015-11-23," I stomached S1 on Netflix and I mean I was laughing hysterically at the sketch comedy that occurs on the island scenes. I mean, that is just overtly cheese...The Bruce Wayne wannabe gets his ass handed to him by non meta-human adversaries on a daily basis. I have no doubt that trogs will continue to watch this trash and keep it on the airways, so unfortunately I will stomach the bad acting and mediocre plot line because I'm a glutton for bad cinema.I hope the CW eventually merges this into the Tyler Perry universe where Oliver Queen is forced into slavery in an ironic twist and forced to marry his black bodyguard, who is a dude. In short, watch this at the risk of not liking it, and continuing to watch because network TV blows in general. ","3"
"Arrow",2015-11-23," Lets just get to the point. first, Arrow is not The Batman. They are 2 different characters. Second, Don't make any new Characters. I mean, if someone is dead, let them be died. Third, make the Black Canary useful. She isn't supposed to be a sidekick. She has potential us it. Fourth, there are many characters that could be used in The Green Arrow storyline. There is Constantine Drakon, Clock King, Clayface. These characters could easily be used for a few episodes. Fiveth, Please kill someone and don't bring them back from the land of the dead. Once dead, let the character be dead. Sixth, Speedy.... My Gode her flat acting skills. Everyone in the series can be seen acting and feel it. but Willa Holland is flat out. ","4"
"Arrow",2015-11-22," Used to love Arrow and my husband and I have been loyal fans but what have they done to this show. SUPERHEROES GALORE. LAZARUS PITS. Come on!!! They don't even mention Oliver's dad's list from season 1. Direction of show has completely gone off track. Does Laurel even practice law anymore? Her character is awful and her fight scenes ridiculous. Only good thing is Ollie and Felicity. FLASHBACKS need to stop. Enough is enough. Bring back Roy. Get rid of Atom. He is atrocious and so is speed talking new employee of Felicity. Get back to helping individual people of Starling City and to original premise of show. It was huge hit first season. Don't fix it if it was not broken in the first place. So disappointed!!!!! Ready to turn channel permanently!!! ","2"
"Arrow",2015-11-19," I have always been a huge fan of comic book superheros. The whole cast for The Arrow, is honestly perfect! I haven't really have had any disappointments with the show. It contains the perfect amount of romance in the show. I say that because I get mad if the superhero I am watching gets to caught up in the girl. I am watching a superhero! I want to see him/her save the world! I see the romance as a bonus! Another great upside of the show, every time I think I know what is coming I don't. It keeps you on your toes, at the edge of your seat wishing this was real life. I hope to see this show lasting at least 10 seasons if not more. I hope that is in their goal plan. The Green Arrow is forever! ","9"
"Arrow",2015-11-19," This show drives me insane. I don't know anything at all about the comic book character, but this show is just worthless. I realize that superhero shows come with a lot of unrealistic ideology, but this show is like a never ending progressive/socialist propaganda machine. Seriously every episode drops not so subtle hints about the evil rich people screwing over poor people all the time and how the corruption is simply because of all these horrible  one percenters  just sitting around being greedy and keeping the little guy down. It's like watching a soap opera written by a bunch of Detroit high school drop outs who can't understand why they shouldn't just have everything handed to them. I thought the flash was apretty cheesy, but this show makes it look like it has the quality of TWD. On top of it all, you have crappy acting and ridiculous action sequences. Horrible horrible horrible show. Avoid at all costs. I can't believe it got such high reviews. Go watch daredevil on Netflix to get your superhero fix and leave this show to die off. ","1"
"Arrow",2015-11-15," I see a lot of hating on the reviews, unfortunately those were written by educated people, or by those individuals who graduated high school. There has to be show on t.v. made for people who look up to D. Trump, Palin and Ben Carson. If we only had programs like Nova, Frontline and Universe, then a lot of people would not have anything to watch, which would be unfair. To be just we have to air programming that CEO's and Wall Street bankers can understand without utterly confusing them. In this world there will always be the lesser, the slow witted as it were..politicians, ceo's , corporate legal teams for example. To deny these mentally diminished groups entertainment is unethical, and maybe immoral. That is why Arrow is great programming. It satiates the dull and dim witted with what they believe to be real life situations, to give a few examples..enlisted soldiers are wealthy, sexual tension with your sister is normal, if you think it, you can do it. With these sub plots and brilliantly stupid story lines Arrow is the masterpiece of the 'Merican' viewer. Because not having to think and the over obvious observation of ridiculous sophomoric male fantasies is a right, and a state of being for many. Basically, all I am saying is that the mentally malformed should have a haven of entertainment sanctuary and if Arrow meets the metric, who am I to deny them their dreams? ","1"

"Arrow",2015-11-12," Although DC Comics definitely isn't beating Marvel in the movie industry, it has a foothold in television. While DC Comics currently has  Arrow ,  The Flash ,  Gotham , and now  Supergirl , Marvel only has a few kids' channel shows, along with the non-superhero  Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D.  and  Agent Carter . Suffice it to say,  Arrow  is definitely the best superhero TV show ever. Once a Batman show comes along, that may change, but for now  Arrow  is a perfect show to sit down and binge-watch.Oliver Queen is stranded on an island for five years, and has been presumed dead along with his father. His father is dead, but he has survived, and his return to Starling City changes the city forever. He has turned from carefree spoiled brat to a buff dude with wicked bow-wielding abilities. He puts a green cloak on with a hood that hides most of his face, puts on some face paint and goes out at night ridding the city of one-percenters.  You have failed this city,  he growls before either sticking an arrow in them or having mercy on them and stuffing them in jail instead. He's not a loner for long, recruiting Oliver Queen's bodyguard, John Diggle, to help him out. Diggle is reluctant at first to be an accomplice of a vigilante. He believes that Oliver doesn't have the right, and of course he's right, but somehow Oliver convinces him anyway. Felicity Smoak also eventually comes along to help Oliver hack and dig through secret government databases...just like a babbling version of Oracle.Oliver Queen has more problems to deal with, than just the vigilante-related problems. His family has had quite a shock, a pleasant one, but a shock nonetheless at his return. Everyone is unbearably curious as to what happened to him on the island, but he is not quite ready to share, and will likely never be. Through flashbacks his past is slowly revealed to the audience; he wasn't alone on that island, and he was tortured...quite a lot happened. He even meets up with Slade Wilson, and becomes close allies with him as they try to escape the island together.Throughout Season 1 lots of familiar villains show up, and the excitement increases. Arrow has yet to grow into the Green Arrow, and by the end of Season 1 he has completely changed. Arrow: Season 1 is a classic example of what a TV series should look like.86/100 ","9"
"Arrow",2015-11-11," Possibly contains spoilers if anyone else started watching this as late as I did: I just started watching this, got about half-way through the first season, but I won't be finishing it. As many others have stated, it's like watching a soap opera. Oh my, the wah-wah drama! The best friend who hasn't grown up one iota in the last five years, still wants to party like they did in college. (But didn't the show state that Oliver dropped out of every college he attended?) But he is going to manage Oliver's club, even though, apparently, no one actually learned anything, but we are to believe they know how to run businesses.Then you have the ex-girlfriend who's sleeping with the bestie but wants the cheating back-from-the-grave ex. This same damsel-in- constant-distress who says she can take care of herself and her job, until she can't, which seems to be every time; she just can't seem to get out or her own way. (BTW, just how did this girl, her sister, the friend-with-benefits who is now a cop, etc., get into the billionaire- boys-club in the first place? I never read the comics so I would really like to know.) Then you have her father, who also can't get out of his own way because he must get that vigilante. Gets a tip of a major crime and all he can focus on is getting that vigilante.The show could have had promise with better writers and directors. I give the actors a break as they are playing the scenes as written and directed. I think they all could have done better if they had a better crew behind the camera. ","3"
"Arrow",2015-11-10," OK when I first started watching this show I thought it would be worth following. And it was for a while but this show, like The Flash has gone so far above imaginative reality I just can't take it anymore. And oh by the way, we are now in the 4th season, it's about time to stop doing the stupid flashback scenes. This show has become one for a young preteen audience and the mentally challenged. Thank goodness what's her name destroyed that pit. It was one thing when it healed Thea but bringing people back to life and the sad attempt to weave magic into the plot. Pathetic. And IMDb some shows just are not worth 10 lines in a review. This is one of them. Lighten up a little. ","2"
"Arrow",2015-11-05," I bought the first 2 seasons of Arrow before watching it, and boy am I glad that I started before I bought anymore. I never read the comic books, so I was going into this show with no real idea of who the Green Arrow was. And I must say it didn't leave a good impression of him on me. The plot isn't well developed. Each episode has a conflict introduction at the beginning and a resolution at the end. It really takes away from the feel of it as a show, with most conflicts not carrying over into the next few episodes. If your going to hold a big angry grudge then hold it for longer than 45 minutes, especially considering the characters reactions are so overdone when they begin a grudge and when they end it. The general plot is pretty generic for a superhero show, which is fine, but I feel like it could have been so much deeper still.The characters themselves aren't great. The actors really aren't anything special, which doesn't help in selling the characters. They have a handful of emotional breakdowns in every episode, and it gets stale really, really fast. It just becomes recycled scenes, and it feels unoriginal and repetitive. And overall the characters can be pretty dumb and oftentimes feel this way thanks to these emotional breakdowns. You could say that they're just emotional people, but considering the fact that EVERYONE is like this, it makes the cast feel much less diverse and interesting. Not only that, but they are oftentimes just dumb people. Not just a few characters, the majority of them make lots of really dumb decisions all the time where the safer and easier resolution is blatantly obvious.  Look I understand that this is a superhero show but you don't have to take the most risky path Oliver because chances are you'll get shot again. The pilot and first episode of season 2 were some of the worst episodes I've ever seen in any TV show. If I had watched the pilot on TV and hadn't bought the first two seasons I definitely would not have continued. I did like that the show focuses more on the characters than fighting bad guys. Unfortunately, the characters weren't done that well to begin with, so the show was lacking in this case. The last 4-5 episodes of both seasons were often much better than the rest of the season, which provided enough reason to continue with the series after season 1 (mostly with the hopes that it'd get better). I don't plan on going past season 2, but it was nice to see that the show made it's last stand of the season a good one. The best part of the show in my opinion were the flashbacks. Often the best episodes were ones where flashbacks were frequent and clips from them were longer than 10 seconds. Overall Arrow just wasn't that great. The excess of emotional breakdowns got annoying and took away from the characters, the structure of each episode, and the shallow plot combined made it difficult to get through at times. I found that the show could very inconsistent at times, with one thing being a problem at one point but then that problem disappearing because it was easier film-wise to just not address it ever again. However, it makes up in some way due to the flashbacks and improvements at the end of each season. Unfortunately, the ending wasn't enough to keep me going for another season of forced drama and poor story-telling. Sure, it had it's good points, but in the end the show just wasn't anything special. ","6"

Nice try but ...do you really think we are that STUPID???Why America? WHY???????To sell more c**p and manufactured, unrealistic ideas about life and it's problems to the impressionable?

"Arrow",2015-09-23," I know a lot of people are currently reviewing the entire show of this to be some ridiculous TV show that has some no interest of anyone over the age of 12, but, I'm 25 and due to the fact that a majority of all TV shows now on-air currently are using DC Universe and Marvel I EXCEPTED change from the Comic Books to the TV show. Everyone is in a high-horse due to this chance, but IT has to be different to fit, because a comic book is only a 5 minute read which is only a 1-minute TV show.The acting in this is fine, you don't have to be a person which has some stupid hypocritical state to be bother by it. If there is anything in this TV show that has to bother you, like it has bothered me is the actions scenes that do not reflect other scenes that have happened.Such as broken glass in a van or the bodies that fall to the ground in one position and end up different in the next scene.If you're looking for a DC comic TV show, then you're safe to watch this without anything going bad for you. If you've read the comics you'll find some familiarity but not all. Same goes for The Flash. ","8"
"Arrow",2015-09-21," This series is so overrated , it crap , s**t p**p , so here my review I want to love Arrow, I really do.Green Arrow has always been one of my favorite DC heroes, and I'm thrilled that he's got his own very successful TV show which, to be fair, is a damn sight better than it might have been. But that doesn't mean that it's as good as it should be.My relationship with the show has run hot and cold. I watched the first seven episodes and quit. Later, during the second season, several friends recommended I give it another try, reassuring me it had gotten a lot better, so I went back and watched everything from the point I'd stopped. And I was glad I did, because it was getting better, and by the end of second season, it was pretty great. I went into the third season excited to see what the show's creators would do next, and then things got painful.Eleven episodes in, basically halfway through the season, I quit again. That was several weeks ago, and this week I decided to give it another chance to get better again, and I've now watched up through the season's thirteenth episode,  Canaries.  And it's still not must-see TV.Before getting into what's wrong with the show, I want to mention some things that are right about it<U+0085> ","1"
"Arrow",2015-09-19," *SPOILER*... Here is the dialogue from every Arrow episode ever written :   you are wrong   ,   you were wright  ,  no you stay here   ,  you were correct but also wrong   ,   are you OK ?  ,   are you OK  and especially   I'm sorry   ,  are you OK ?   <U+0085> sounds captivating doesn't it ?Biggest issue out of the way : if one decides to make a superhero series and divide every 45 minute episode in 35 minutes of dialogue and 10 minutes of actual action ; wouldn't it be an inspired idea to make the dialogue <U+0085> good ? ALL of them go trough the same thing every time and they never ever learn from their mistakes , it's so frustrating . It's like you're in a badly written reboot of Groundhog day . More good writing : occasionally they have a good story arc going yet every time they choose to sacrifice it in order to keep a cliffhanger vibe going <U+0085> that's marketing , not writing . When they try to entertain a longer story , they always bury it for a while to maintain their   every week a new villain   thing and guess what : KEEP THE CLIFFHANGER GOING !!! When the end of the season is close by , the sword of Damocles hangs above all . Enter new season , that sword turned out to be a pin our hero forgot to take out of his new shirt ... you know , lazy writing . ","4"
"Arrow",2015-09-18," *WARNING CONTAINS HEAVY SPOILERS* As of today I've only watched the first two seasons, but I wanted to review this show already, just because it's so great. This is a show about what would really happen if someone put on a costume and started fighting crime. And two seasons later we're all loving it. Let's start with the pros. The cast is all really good. Willa Holland as Thea Queen is especially good, as is Manu Bennet as Slade Wilson, aka Deathstroke. That's not to discredit the others, they're all good as well, I just can't list each one individually because a) I don't know their names and b) if I did, we'd be here all day. Something else I like about the show is how much it emulates the comics. We have standard tropes of the comic books as well as subtle references, and the occasional poke at the source material. Aside from Flash, no superhero show has ever captured the comics this well, and this show takes everything good about comics, and everything good about regular drama/crime shows, and merges it together to make what just might be my favorite show. I also like that it doesn't degenerate into cartoony silliness, and keeps the entire thing grounded in reality, and takes the whole thing seriously. That being said though, I loved that they later introduced some actual super-powers, Slade, Roy, etc. I think it would've been interesting if Roy had kept his powers, and he was forced to control them, I think that would've been very interesting. But here's something strange, people I know did not like the inclusion of super-powers, so... am I alone on this, or what? Let's talk about the finales some, and a couple other episodes that stand out. I liked the ending of season 1 because you had a really great wrap up to everything, a final duel with the villain that had a great climax, and a really tragic moment when Tommy dies and the Glades are destroyed. It's interesting seeing the bad guys kind of winning. The finale to season 2 on the other hand was more or less a mixed bag for me. Let me put it this way: when it was the personal fight between Oliver and Slade, that was good. When it was armies of super-soldiers just getting wiped out by the League of assassins, I was actually kind of bored. They diminished the threat of the soldiers to the point where you didn't feel any danger. The other episode I wanted to talk about was City of Blood, which follows Moira Queen's death, in this episode, Oliver is going to turn himself in to Slade to save the rest of his loved ones. They handled that really well, with how you don't see Oliver for almost half the episode, and his resignation to his defeat was really touching. Now on one final note, let's talk villains. First off, Huntress is a great villain (villainess?) Because it wasn't just the clichéd thing where Oliver realizes she's bad and just no longer cares about her. No, you can tell he still cares, and as Diggle points out, he would've killed her if she was anyone else. Now let's talk Merlyn and Slade. Merlyn was great because he was the behind the scenes manipulator combined with the evil reflection of the hero, and the actor just played him with the right level of smugness, that you really love to hate him. Slade was the type of villain who's super powerful and is out to tear Oliver's life apart because of the loss of the woman he loved. As I said earlier, he was played really well, and was very menacing. Between the two main villains, I would have to give Death-stroke the edge, because he was developed more, and just had more of an overall presence. So there you go, that's my take on Arrow, here's hoping the third season is just as good. ( by the way, I'll update this once I've finished watching season 3) ","9"
"Arrow",2015-09-09," ..ok.. just finished watching season one. Went in without any expectations... immediate impression after watching entire first season.. an episodic comic book with live action, with 'millionaires' no longer cuttin it.. gotta be 'billionaires.' Acting was very passable with some obvious exceptions.. overacting the main culprit (there's that comic book thing). Script was good most of the time, but the three story lines going on simultaneously was tiresome after awhile.. and the island portion got tedious and boring not too long into the season. Production values were impressive, considering the number of episodes in this season. This is like making twelve movies.. and considering that.. it must be said, they did it overall pretty well. The big exit in the last episode was somewhat a surprise, but in hindsight, they really could not have kept that threesome going back and forth any longer without being ridiculous. And as for right now.. who's actually dead or might still be alive... who cares? S2 will be interesting, I expect/ hope it will get better. As they show they know how to do it, and be that the case, if you're smart you learn from your lapses. So, now on to the next season! Sorry.. hard as I tried.. could not get through more than several episodes of season two. What this show really fails to do is come up with some bad guys that you really love to hate !! All good-evil shows have to have equal measures of both, and Arrow just doesn't do it. I'm gone. And as for rating.. S1 could maybe get a 7.. S2 is totally lacking, and deserves no more than a 5.

"Arrow",2015-09-04," I am a comic book fan and this is definitely not supposed a  comic booky  show if you will. Firstly, the character of green arrow is not even called green arrow, so this tells you it is only loosely based off green arrow. Oliver Queen is more serious but he is still a well done character. The Arrow is unsurprisingly a more serious vigilante. He definitely becomes more of a hero rather than a vigilante which is a good change. The origin is a bit different but still very well done. The flashbacks get better as the show goes on. The plot escalates well. Most of the characters develop well especially Tommy, and detective Lance. I just don't like Laurel but the rest of the show makes up for it. Any who insult this show, likely haven't watched through even season 1, so they have no reason to complain. It was good from the beginning but improves as the show goes on. In closing, watch and see for yourself. ","10"
"Arrow",2015-08-20," Something about playing DC Comics' billionaire crime-fighter character Oliver Queen turns Stephen Amell into a less than inspired actor. As in, he can't deliver most of his lines with any of the baseline conviction that either a billionaire or a super hero should have in abundance. Amell's decision to stay as far away from gravitas as possible saps energy from this show about a modern day Robin Hood meets Batman type of hero. Throw in bad guys who wait to be shot with an (eponymous) arrow rather than pull the trigger on their leveled and waiting bad guy guns, and lazy and ill-framed exterior shots reminiscent of a lackluster episode of CHiPs, and you get left with some mostly unwatchable television.

"Arrow",2015-08-20," I haven't watched a series live since literally, the first few episodes of Boston Legal. My Gwife doesn't want me playing video games, and my life, at 40, is too exciting for Ashley Madison ;) and too boring for primetime, I have to do something.So in about a month I've watched way too many series. Repetitive themes, ailing heros, too predictable, abrupt plot changes, and not enough of an audience.To all that, this is the best show around.I've watched, and liked, Game of Thrones (I think the writers might only drink more than I do), Walking Dead (solid and S L O W), another of this genre Daredevil (see above repetitive themes, and although entertaining altogether Unbelievable), the Strain, House of Cards (politics is my favorite sport), and Falling Skies (I thought only a cat had 9 lives, but a better SciFi than most movies of late).You've got good actors, good writers, a solid story, and imaginative believability, unless you've never seen what money can do, buy.I fast forward through most TV series because they stuff the content with  fillers , not this one, best I've seen, from that stand point. Season 1 alone I can vouch for, but it's a really really goodie.... ","10"
"Arrow",2015-08-17," NOTE: SPOILERS AHEADWhen I first saw the trailer for this show, having been a big Justice League fan as a kid, I immediately (and erroneously) started looking forward to watching this show. Oliver Queen to me was always like an alternative to Batman with his sort of solo act, martial arts type persona, along with added humor. However, while this rendition of Oliver Queen has both the fitness and martial arts skills down, his portrayal of the character seems almost confused at times, as he seems to try too hard to be faking the playboy type guy that he once was, while also being a serious tough guy at other times. These almost bipolar type actions detract from the character, as one would only expect Oliver Queen to be able to naturally be able to play both roles rather than one or the other. Had this series been a little more realistic, then Oliver Queen would have been effectively giving himself away as a fake to anybody who spends more than 10 minutes around him. This however, I could forgive or perhaps live with until the character becomes more refined, however there is an even bigger problem that I have with this series....THE WRITING! When I watch this show, there are often cringe worthy one liners (often times followed by the characters walking away from the person they just supposedly  zinged ), and awkward pauses all along the way, which I guess the writers/producers may have thought evoked more emotion, but it is terribly overused and makes the series feel more like a Soap Opera than an action series. I mean seriously, most true to heart superhero action fans are not looking for a soap opera styled show with excessive drama, and the plot is already thick enough on its own that a dramatic pause after every big detail really is not necessary. Oliver Queen I really think if the writers/producer took a similar style to the now critically proclaimed Daredevil Netflix Original series, DC comic's Arrow really could be a true competitor.There are a few more issues that I could go on about, like the fact that every person who shoots an automatic weapons seems less capable of shooting something than a Stormtrooper from Star Wars. Or that it is not explained until at least very late into the 1st season (as that is as far as I got before having to call it quits) how Oliver Queen became a computer genius after being away for 5 years on a deserted island even though he is somehow able to program a computer virus to steal 40 million dollars in the first episode. Or the fact that Queen brought all sorts of top of the line bulky tech and workout equipment down to an abandoned warehouse when all he seems to drive in the first season is a motorcycle without all the homeless people outside the warehouse noticing him bringing the equipment in......I could go on, but it would be pointless. This series had some serious potential, and maybe it does get better after the first season. But I honestly couldn't bring myself to watch more of the Soap Opera style nonsense that this series seems to have been successful by. If you are really looking for a great, much better written superhero series at the moment, I strongly recommend Netflix's Daredevil. This series, Arrow, is not deserving of the 8.1 it now has on IMDb, as that rating was quite misleading to me. I seriously hope this series lives on, but through the eyes of different writers, because I really do like the story line and actors. Actors: 7/10Action: 6.5/10 (the guys missing Arrow in some sequences with fully auto weapons was cringe worthy)Plot: 7/10 (starting from episode 1, the plot has more holes at first than Swiss Cheese, but at least some get filled by 3/4 of the way through Season 1)Writing: 4/10Overall: 6/10 ","6"
"Arrow",2015-08-03," Following the theme of Nolan's gritty Dark Knight, we are given the TV show about Arrow, a billionaire playboy turned vigilante. You'd think that that's where the similarities would end, but it doesn't. Watching this TV show, I felt like I was watching a lazy rip off of the Dark Knight trilogy, except this time there is far too much soap operas, not enough moral dilemmas, and a lot or racy scenes to rope in newcomers.This show's iteration of Oliver Queen is broody, a master martial artist, and tactical genius - sound familiar? That's right, Queen here is not a gruff guy with a sense of humour, he's just broody. In fact, a major plot point in season 2 practically screams Batman.But Oliver Queen's live screen portrayal is not that bad. At one point or another, I had just wished they had killed off one of the main characters because it was just that unbearable. A lot of them felt very one dimensional, only gaining depth in the later half of season 2 - which is very late to flesh out characters. This is probably due to the cringe-worthy dialogue that even the best actors would have trouble making the audience believe the emotional weight behind it.Special effects and scale of the actions scenes are very lacking in size and scope as well as authenticity. The fighting looks extremely choreographed with long panning shots generally seen in Asian martial arts films, but the thing is, the actors in Arrow don't have a martial arts background which makes the long panning shots feel caricatured.All in all, the acting could be better if the directing was better. Dialogue needs a huge overhaul, and there is a lot of potential wasted when it comes to the story. So many times, the narrative could've been more powerful if the writers were willing to take a more daring risk instead of the clichéd deus ex wrap up. ","5"
"Arrow",2015-07-30," First time I heard about Green Arrow / Oliver Queen was in Smallville. I loved this series and just at the moment Justin Hartley came to play Arrow, I was in love. The last two seasons I only watched because of him. And then there was the plan to make Arrow to a new series. The best news ever. But, there was this little problem, Justin was not the man, they wanna make the new Arrow. At first I was really angry because of that and I didn't wanna watch the new thing. But then I saw the trailer and I thought, OK, Stephen will get his chance to proof his talent. And what can I say ? He made it.Since the beginning I knew, why Justin never got this role. He is sweet and too cute to play this dark character they created for the new Arrow. Stephen is so good in his job and I do believe everything he say or do. Oh and Felicity, I love her. She is so funny and cute. The best friend you will every have. Also Diggle. This Guy is amazing. Oliver will never have a better friend than him.I loved the first and the second season. The third was not really my thing. There were a lot of stories I didn't liked. So I hope season 4 will be better again. ","8"
"Arrow",2015-07-29," Season one was inspiring, I enjoyed his workout scene. The plot was good and intense, updates and doing good in the city along with background story being explained, step by step.Season two was fine. All characters got developed.Season three was disappointing to me.Got few conclusions: 1. A hero has to be the ONLY CHILD in his family. Having a sister is problematic.2. Having Barry in the middle of season 3 was funny, but how can you possible have him to play the plot-twisting role in the last episode? It was simply absurd to me to see a character from ANOTHER show to save everyone in the dungeon.3. I don't see how Atom fit into the show. Season three feels too mixed: the intense atmosphere brought by the darkness side does not properly work with the sunny and casual part from Ray. Somehow I feel he belongs to The Flash more.4. I do hope season 4 gets better. ","6"
"Arrow",2015-07-26," Arrow is a good series not as fictional as the flash or as exaggerated as batman or Superman.its a really tense series and you can't even stop yourself from spoiling it I didn't like season 3 too much because it was a bit too dramatic. Season 2 and season one was the best season 4 is going to probably be like season 1 in terms of the mood. Season 1 was probably the best in terms of action two in Terms of darkness and three in teems of drama which nobody likes so Season one was the best. Fans are wondering when is oliver going to become green arrow I assure you it is season 4. So that's it and this is my favorite show. I particularly like deastroke. Scary ","10"
"Arrow",2015-07-22," OK - first off - it's clear from the overall rating that this series has a lot of fans - so just to weed out those who will unequivocally defend this series - let me clarify:What I'm looking for is responses form people who, maybe started optimistic - found their interest waning - but persevered, so they can tell me if they: -found that their perseverance was eventually rewarded, or -concluded that they'd wasted their time.This is a series I decided to give try - with no prior knowledge of it (Green Arrow was a DC hero I was aware of, but never read as a kid).Characters felt clunky - back story fairly average for a Superhero origin story - but enough to make me continue (it seemed like this would be a fairly entertaining, if not game changing bit of throwaway entertainment. Some seeds of longer term story lines sown - maybe it'll be OK. So I continuedFirst couple of episodes - if I had to do something I'd pause, go do my thing and return. But by about the third episode - I found I was no longer bothering to pause because it was unlikely I'd miss any critical scenes/moments. By episode 5 I started doing other things while watching it (I fancy a cup of tea. I think I'll get my dumbbells out and do my daily exercises. I need to pee) because it's that easy to follow without much attention.Much of the series seems to be populated by a seemingly endless stream of vignettes, where one character gives a short speech to Oliver before he exits the room silenced by their outburst, or they exit the room, leaving a speechless Oliver to either: -stoically reflect on what they said (and consequently hone/modify the ethics/morality of his behaviour) or -languish in the pain caused by trying to maintain a dual identity without upsetting/alienating his family friends and loved ones.It's gotten really tedious!There's nothing really new here. But that's fine. Characters are pretty dumb/simplistic. That's fine too. Problem is - there's little that's exciting here either (some fairly well choreographed fight scenes in places - but not many).Each episode: -We find out who he's targeting this week; -it's interspersed with aforementioned vignettes (where' he'll either learn or teach a valuable lesson; -there's some (seemingly) superfluous romance thrown in (like the 'will they won't they?' romance between his ex and his best mate - presumably that'll lead somewhere - but please get on with it - cuz I really don't care what take-out food they're cosying up to tonight!) -one or two flashback scenes, which loosely correlate to the morality of this week's bad guy story -get bad guy -onto the next episode.I think the problem for me is that there's not a single character or actor I've really warmed to (apart from maybe the cop/father) - nor is there a character I've really grown to despise. I find most of them just mildly irritating - or just plain dull.However, I recognise that some series don't find their stride immediately - just a some comic books didn't, until an imaginative writer came along. But if I haven't found something to hang some hope on after 6 episodes I start feeling like I'm being taken for a ride (e.g the pace of the series is deliberately pedestrian so as to elongate a thin storyline across as many lucrative ad breaks as possible)As I said: I'm now at episode 8 and about to give up, with a view to taking up knitting as a more thrilling distraction. But it's not to late for my mind to be changed ;)Many thanks. ","5"
"Arrow",2015-07-21," I rated this 5 purely because of the really irritating amount of screen time they use with all the drama about who's loving who and who wants to be with who. I don't care and i'm sure any die hard Green Arrow fan couldn't care either. Why do so many producers insist in adding so much love drama in a series that could be 100% better without it. Yeah love interests are a real thing, but why does it seem the main focus in this series? is it to draw in a wider audience? your audience are people who are initially interested in the DC/comic book genre and i can bet a lot of them have lost interest because of your poor choices by making this seem like some stupid twilight series but with heroes and not vampires.Overall though i enjoy it but i just have to grit my teeth through the painful love drama, there is no need to make the show so focused in that area, WE WANT SUPER HEROES NOT LOVE STORYS! ","5"
"Arrow",2015-07-20," It was a promising start. I will give it that. But the quality fell down equally as the story went on. Why? Let me show you some points. But it contains spoiler.Eventually everybody you know will become a superhero. Fighting ninja's like they are nothing. Another awesome thing is it takes only few months to become a superhero. Arrow provides stupid reasons to do stupid things. Like starting a war for a simple emotional stupid reason. Arrow sleeps with every lady character except for his mom and sister. WOW!So Arrow is simply a combination of weak script, weak acting and maybe weak casting. Come on!! We viewers are not that stupid. ","6"
"Arrow",2015-07-14," This series is a good entertaining watch but on a closer look ,this feels like a cut down version of Batman made in to a drama kind of setting. There is the pompous son. There is the the island where he gets transformed. Later comes back.Takes on a vigilante role. Sounds familiar? I don't know how many have noticed. The costumes are different and the attacking mechanisms are some what dissimilar but basically,it is batman cut down to something different. Still enjoyable though.This series will definitely appeal to young audience due to the charm of the actor who plays it. But every-time I see one of those episodes , I remember Batman. I can't help it.Also there is one more thing. They got some kind of agreement or deal with Microsoft. Every time someone wants to do something on computers,they show a Windows logo,take out a tablet or a laptop that specifically displays the Windows logo and the here is the icing on the cake. To browse something, they open up the internet explorer. I mean, seriously? Who the heck uses it these days, other than to navigate to google and and download Chrome or even Firefox for that matter? ","7"
"Arrow",2015-07-14," Okay, first of all, I never thought I would post a review on IMDb and least of all about the 'Arrow' series. This is basically why: I started watching 'Arrow' mainly because all my other favorite series had either finished or in between seasons (just for comparison, some of them are 'Breaking Bad', 'Game of Thrones', 'True Detective', 'Hannibal', 'The Walking Dead', 'Mad Men' etc.) I also enjoy superhero flicks and series, I gave 'The Flash' a go and I actually liked it, especially towards the end of season one. That's where I first got to know of the Arrow character and that the Flash and Arrow series are intertwined, so I decided to give 'Arrow' a chance. The pilot was promising, if a little bit clichéd and predictable, but as we all know, a pilot is maybe the most difficult episode for a series, since it has to intrigue the viewer, introduce main characters and plot points and a plethora of other elements. The story of Oliver Queen also has an almost comical resemblance to that of Bruce Wayne's, but that's all I can say before venturing in spoiler territory. So, my opinion on the series in a nutshell - the first few episodes I didn't like so much, but still stuck to watching 'Arrow', mainly because I had a good feeling about the plot. Acting, dialogue, action sequences were all sub-par, if not awful. This is what went on throughout the first season. However, I was not dissuaded by the negative reviews in IMDb or my own high standards, and I'm thankful for it. Season 2 shows growth in the series and by season 3 there were already some powerful moments, the clichéd dialogue was all but gone, the 'family drama' element was polished to 'family values' and so on. In conclusion, 'Arrow' is a series which in my opinion starts off very shaky and even irritating but gets more stable and interesting as the seasons progress. Give it a chance, and if you somehow get through the first season - enjoy the ride! Rating 7 - because of bad first season, but still high rating for the overall series. ","7"
"Arrow",2015-07-02," It had a good start, but I wouldn't recommend starting to watch it if you're one for pointing out inconsistencies. Maybe I had high expectations after watching Netflix's Daredevil, but this one seemed overly dramatic and repetitive. The formula  catching the bad guys in one episode and the big bad boss after a whole season  with a dash of drama and toxic love triangles, squares and hexagons seems to go for every season. The intro should be changed to  My name is Oliver Drama Queen and I've been stranded on an island with the only interesting plot (up until the 2nd season anyway) in the whole series.  4/10 because they tried and Stephen Amell is eye candy.

"Arrow",2015-06-29," His name is Oliver Queen, presumed dead he (allegedly) spent 5 years on an Island, now DCs most badass, ruthless hero has returned to Gotha..I mean Starling City and he's here to kick some serious bad guy ass.Wait, most badass hero? Surely that title belongs to Batman right? What makes Arrow more badass than Batman? The fact that he kills people, not just when he has to but sometimes for the sake of it. It is so refreshing to see that. Sit back and enjoy the amazing fight choreography that will have you at the edge of your seat. Watch Oliver Queen keep up his playboy persona whilst battling Starlings worst criminals.Be relieved that they skip past the origin story and get straight to him being The Arrow....but if you're the 1% who actually cares about what happened on the Island, enjoy the origin story in the form of weekly flashbacks showing how Gothams...damn I mean Starlings greatest playboy becomes the most ruthless Hero on DCs roster. Watch him hunt down the people who targeted his corrupt family and tried to kill him, as he uncovers the  unpredictable  story that you will see coming from a mile away.With a perfect mixture of awesome characters, such has his mother, sister, Diggle, his driver turned bodyguard turned lover. His sidekick and not love interest Felicity Smoak who is the comic relief but never is it ever hinted that he loves her or she loves him at all. In this world where superpowers don't exist and will never ever exist according to our very reliable and competent writers, watch our Emerald Archer face off against The Dark Archer and his evil plan to do something very evil on a very large evil scale of evilness! But that's just Season One! Then comes the rest of the show where they take away all the things that made Arrow unique and get rid of them! Except the flashbacks, nah they are still coming in and they are coming in strong baby.Cringe, while you watch the main characters comic book love story sidelined so the writer can force another love story that makes no sense at all onto the fans because they get writing cues from their teenage daughters.Watch this Batman wannabe try so hard and fail at doing what Batman does naturally. Die a little bit inside while the writers destroy the most ruthless Villains from the DC universe and make them into Angst filled caricatures of themselves.Just when you think the show is at the worst it could be, the writers throw season 3 at ya. Where you want to kill yourself just so you don't have to be around to witness how they butcher all the characters and bring one silly blonde to the forefront and give her silly illogical story lines that will make you want to scream and question your own sanity. Watch the competent writers destroy yet another DC Super Villain and blatantly steal stories from Batman, literally the stuff that happens to Batman happens to this guy. Whereas in Batman you feel he is worthy, whereas you just want to chuck your remote at this guy.So my advice, watch Season One and suffer through Season Two, then play Russian Roulette, if you survive then watch Daredevil instead.

"Arrow",2015-06-24," This is the first TV series after Batman in which i saw the great superhero without superpowers, But no doubt the the role is brilliantly performed by Stephen Amell as Oliver Queen.I was the great fan of Green Arrow from my childhood, i used to buy and read its comics. I remember the day when my girlfriend gifted me the Green Arrow Leather Jacket on my birthday just because i was so crazy about it, by the way thanks to the Fjackets.com for making just a fantastic outfit.Overall this show has just getting better with every episode so i've got high hopes for it the next few seasons.Green Arrow you Rocks!

"Arrow",2015-06-07," When I first began watching Arrow, I thought it was essentially a superhero soap opera. If they re-did the first season with Latin American actors, it would become an instant telenovela success on Telemundo. I was ready to rate Arrow 6 out of 10 stars initially for the excessive gimmicks seen in season one.But season two absolutely blew me away. You could definitely tell how much the show as a whole evolved just after watching a few episodes. The story, characters as well as character development, and plot were incredibly well-written. It almost felt like I was watching an entirely different show. Season two was so well done that it earned the show an overall 8 out of 10 from me, and I sincerely hope they remain consistent going into season three. ","8"
"Arrow",2015-06-03," This is my first ever review of a show/movie of any kind. This is a not a series worth watching unless you have some extra time on your hands. There are just so many better options out there. I really gave this show a chance and wanted to like it. I made it halfway through season 2, but I just cannot do it anymore. The overall acting is very poor throughout the series. There are maybe two or three characters whose acting is decent. Between the stiff acting and cheesy writing, I find myself cringing a handful of times while watching each episode. The plot is simple enough and easy to follow, but there is nothing new and amazing (even for someone unfamiliar with the comic book series such as myself). If you are looking for quality acting in any superhero based series on TV nowadays, The Flash is your best bet. ","3"
"Arrow",2015-06-02," What I mean by my summary is that is this for the Superhero fan? Yes! Is it for a teenager? Yes! But me being a life long super hero fan, there is too much  teenie bopper  love material injected throughout this series. Not enough to steer a super hero fan away (for most). But it is there and I find myself having an off-screen experience with an eye-roll. Hope that makes sense. I like shows like the new Daredevil series that is a total escape. One that doesn't even allow you to think of any reality. This series Arrow misses the mark in that respect...BUT it is still entertaining enough to keep me coming back.The acting & possibly directing are a little off here. The conversations are awkward. Especially when one gets a phone call. Queue the awkward  I need to get this! . No one does this in real life to the frequency it happens here. There are quite a bit of awkward exchanges that just don't flow well. But there is definitely some eye candy in this series. Very pretty women...and best I can tell as a guy, Oliver Green (Stephen Amell) seems to be a nice looking dude. This tied with a superhero series and a solid storyline....I'll keep watching. ","6"
"Arrow",2015-06-01," Betrayal! Betrayed me! Sara sucks! And Caity Lotz should never act again. Katie Cassidy save this show. So beautiful and attractive, so talented. Deserve an Emmy. I would be happy if they renamed the show Black Canary and made Laurel the star. Oh yes! Oh yes! I would love that. Stephen Amell and David Ramsey, John Barrowman is awesome as well. Thea is hot. Very sexy. No Katie, but i would totally *beep* the actress. And the guy who plays Quentin is great too. But the guy playing Ra's did a poor job. It wasn't his fault but the script. Emily Bett Rickards makes a terrible performance by the female mary sue character called Felicity. Her fans is the most annoying ones. ","6"
"Arrow",2015-05-31," The first few episodes are good in that we learn the hero's back story, his need for vengeance and teasers on how he became a weak playboy to a fearless, strong vigilante. We also meet a few characters that are sure to be future heroes/villains as the series develops and the episodes delve into each character's backgrounds and current/future interests. This show suffers from a dramatic screenplay as the main and side characters worry about their feelings much like a soap opera or elementary school playground would feel. Add to that the unreal and overdone effects of cannon fodder enemies that can never hit anyone with any type of gun and a ridiculous concept that a normal bow can withstand the blow of strong kicks or swords and still fire with 100% accuracy. The show literally had a few gang members toting semi-automatic guns, firing at Oliver nearly 10-15 yards and could not land a single hit; but, Oliver always gets injured by the main enemy or a much less harmful enemy/neutral character. I would still stand the plot holes and ridiculous action scenes if it weren't for the acting and soap opera feel. Sorry, but I do not find Laurel attractive at all and the show always tries to capitalize on her as eye candy. As though they want to distract the male audience with the elephant in the room of bad writing, acting and let many drama scenes play out. ","3"
"Arrow",2015-05-29," Of all 3 series of superheroes Arrow, Flash and Daredevil it comes in second for my taste Daredevil is the best of the 3. Arrow gets so stupid for a superhero character , guy goes on a boat with his girlfriend sister, comes back and his best friend is on a relationship with his ex girlfriend, Oliver gives an advice to his friend to fight for the women he loves but that same night sleeps with the girl and off course his friend cries but doesn't give up his secret, then sister comes back from death sleeps with her,and he also slept with the daughter of an enemy with his CEO. His mom is all about protecting her family but kills her husband and laurel character so stupid. I gave 3 because the guy from Flash and his love life its more stupid. Action is good they just should stick to it. ","3"
"Arrow",2015-05-28," DC was a one trick pony for me for a long time. I felt characters using arrows are outdated. the beginning of the series made me change my mind on both. I started to like (green)arrow. But what dc give it takes away.Season 2 was alright, though it had its flaws in character logic's, but still hold up.But season 3 is just bitching, bitching, whipping, bitching, bitching... and bs, lots of bs. Although credits for killing of the terrible black canary. Less credit for spending so much time whipping on her death. When Ra's  killed  Oliver... that was still a bit did they really? but soon spoiled that they did not... and it was meh, except the hole  you made me think...blah blah  following it, hitting every possible cliché it can touch... and it just kept on and on going with Roy feeling guilty, Thea founding out the truth, wanting to kill her dad, wanting to die, feeling betrayed...ahhhh. than doing the same oh he/she  died  with Thea, Roy, the hole team. it got really stretched and terrible. season 3 kind feels like  we interrupt this action scene with some random bitching  and as the season progressed Bitching toked over and sometimes featured action for old time stakes.I point out emotions don't equal bitching. If your characters rehearsal lines over and over witch every action/superhero movie/series did that's bitching, that's fake, that's annoying, that's boring. that's why i probably wont watch season 4. ","1"
"Arrow",2015-05-23," Let me start off by saying the first two seasons were great. Season 1 set up all the characters, and introduced us to characters from the DC universe at a reasonable pace. The action was good, the acting was occasionally off-putting, but mostly solid. Season 2 upped everything tremendously. The villain, Slade Wilson (AKA Deathstroke) was incredibly well-acted, physically menacing and he had understandable motivation. To him, Oliver had killed the love of his life and he wanted to take an eye for an eye, somewhat literally in this case. His actions also had lasting repercussions, seeing as he murdered Oliver's mother and devastated the city with what amounted to super-soldiers. Season 3 looked to continue the trend. However, one thing in particular seemed to spoil these good vibes: The Oliver/Felicity relationship that carried over from the season 2 finale. It turned Felicity, a strong, smart and all-around admirable female character, into someone who was only there so she could provide moral opposition to Oliver's actions. Not only that, but it reeked of nothing but fan-service. Felicity clearly had something for Oliver since the beginning, but there had been no sign of those feelings being reciprocated. Ra's Al Ghul was a great villain, and the mid-season fight between him and Oliver was great, but his death was very underwhelming. It also broke all suspension of disbelief when Oliver was stabbed in the sternum and kicked off of what looked like a 40+ foot drop and yet could survive without any permanent injury! One more personal gripe is how the show screams,  We're dark and edgy, there is no such thing as fun  all the time. The only instance in which I can recall Laurel smiling is when she crossed over into the Flash show. Also, correct me if I am wrong, all of the action in the show takes place in the dead of night, aside from the flashbacks. This seems like it might change with season 4, but I think Daredevil nailed the right balance of humour and grittiness.I adored the first two seasons, and I was a fan of the third up until the 2/3 mark or so. It is a great show, at least for the first two seasons, and those aforementioned seasons are a must- watch to me, as long as you are a fan of superheroes. ","8"
"Arrow",2015-05-21," After watching the first season and being addicted immediately seeing these characters going about their day and fighting crimes at night seeing to their city will be safe for another day. I've been waiting for shows like this to come out and the past year has blown apart the  T.V. scene  with superhero/vigilante's but by far Arrow has been the best one out their from day one. Going through every episode nervously watching Oliver Choose the paths laid out in front of him making him stronger and stronger every outcome that has been put on the table was probably the most addictive aspect of this show but another huge thing I can't seem to let go is the performance of each and every actor and how real they make the whole environment become, Out of the thrill, Nerves, or any other feelings I encounter while watching this show my rating would be a 10/10 any day and highly recommend anyone who hasn't watched it to start up the first episode right away! ","10"
"Arrow",2015-05-19," I was hesitant to write this review, but because for some time now follow this show, I decided nevertheless to write.Show was interesting at first, entertaining although it encountered a series of boring episodes. Also, the constant repetition of  I'm here to protect you  which repeats at least 5 times in each episode is really annoying. Dramatic effects are poor... I really do not like forced scenario, only for dramatic effects. The culmination of the drama queens is Thea Queen. Her acting is pretty bad. Similar is with Felicity whose role is  funny , where she is a hacker, doctor, engineer... and she is not look like that at all. How she hacks and doing her job is at least ridiculous. After watching the first episode of season 4 I completely lost interest in this series. Everything turned into hog wash. I almost fell asleep. Dialogues are so bad, skinny Thea throws heavy people in truck like they are made of paper...idiocy. The idea that everyone wanna be super heroes in general does not make it interesting and is very boring. the characters have lost their meaning and role. No character is no longer interesting, even Arrow. Just a pity that there is material much better, but they blew it with excessive drama and stupid (meaningless) dialogues. Boring... ","3"
"Arrow",2015-05-18," Arrow is the best show I have ever watched. Oliver Queen is a beast in this show. For instance he taps like every chick in that show and fights like a beast. Another beast character in this show is Malcom Merlyn and Deathstroke. When Deathstroke went to prison, that was one of the most sadder points of the show. However, the good news is that Malcom Merlyn is still in the show and still is a beast. However, by the most recent episodes, it seems like Malcom is not going to be in the show as much anymore. However, my least favorite character is Felicity. She is a total bit*h who gets friend zoned by Oliver constantly throughout the show, but still wants to blow him, and for some stupid reason the makers of arrow decided that it was a good idea to have Oliver bone felicity and run away with her in the season finale, so felicity probably did blow him. Also this is stupid because Felicity is a ugly w*ore, whereas Laurel is pretty hot and arrow should re-bone her, cause she is definitely hotter than Felicity. Also he should have boned Isabel Rochev more in season 2 cause she was also hot. Speaking of things Roy is also a super raw character. I am just pi*sed that Roy left in season 3 cause he was cool, but at least he got the opportunity to bang Thea, who is also hot. For these reasons most of the girls in this shows are pretty hot, but they should keep adding hotter girls because ye. Another one of my favorite characters other than Arrow, Malcom, Deathstroke(Slade Wilson), Roy Harper, is Deadshot. That was also a very saddening part in the show when Deadshot died, but at least he died doing what he loved, which was killing people. Another person who I like is John Diggle, because he is kind of the wise guy of team arrow. Also he always says  let's throttle back , which I find hilarious, so I lol a lot whenever he says that. Another character I like is Laurel, because when she had a drug problem in season 2, that was really funny cause she was so annoying, even though she got uglier in season 2, but I guess that is the downside to doing drugs in the show. Also in season 3 she is hilarious when she is the black canary and constantly gets her a*s kicked. I think of Laurel as like the commedic aspect of the show as well as her dad who is old and sucks at fighting also. Also the irony in season 1 was awesome, like when Tommy says that Oliver needs to get laid cause he has not taped anything in 5 years but little did Tommy know, Oliver boned at least 2 chicks multiple times in the island, Sara and Shado. Personally I think he could probably do better than Sara but I guess he did not have many options on the island but he should not have boned her back in Starling City because ye. However, I am a bit disappointed in the fact that Thea and Oliver are not related because if they were not they would totally bone. So I hope I find out that they are not related, so its not gross if they bone. Finally, I think that the whole idea of the canary is stupid because it is derived from Sara who also sucked at fighting and fought with a stupid a*s pole. However, overall, arrow is the best show ever created and I hope they keep airing seasons until arrow is like 80 years old because that would be funny to see some old guy with back problems beat up a bunch of thugs. ","10"
"Arrow",2015-05-18," I'm sorry but laurel was the worst choice of an actor. Unlike everyone else I won't lie about why. Laurel is ugly. Her face is disgusting and that combined with her horribly spoiled egotistical self centered personality makes her the worst choice. The best actors in the world, believe it or not, are easy on the eyes. If you made Brad Pitt ugly he would not be famous. She is annoying and that's part of her character. Cool no problem but she is not forgiving in her annoyance. It's not like, well her horrible personality is tolerable because she's attractive (for TV standards). But you can't kill her off... But you can replace her with a new actor and people can just look past it. Cut your losses arrow, an amazing show completely ruined by one fish face. That is all. Your welcome for the harsh truth. I gave the show a 5 out of 10. If laurel was replaced it would get a 8.5 out of 10 in NY opinion. ","5"
"Arrow",2015-05-15," There's a whole lot I really love about Arrow. Unfortunately, the writers continue to dilute the greatness with feeble clichés and annoying, character-breaking contrivances. These keep Arrow from being the classic show it could so easily be.One thing that Arrow gets absolutely right are the dark, moody visuals. The series looks exactly the way it should - it's worth watching just for the great photography. Also worthwhile: the impeccable staging of the action scenes. The archery, the swordplay, the fist fights - everything feels real. This is swashbuckling done right.Then there's the casting. Blond, square-jawed Stephen Amell looks much too good to be true, but, amazingly, he's got the personality to carry off his difficult role. He's believable as Oliver Queen, self-centered rich boy, and equally believable as Arrow, the merciless vigilante. The rest of the cast is pretty solid as well, but Emily Bett Rickards tends to steal the show as Felicity Smoak. It seems as if her character has been built up more than originally intended. Her likable, upbeat quality makes a perfect counterbalance to the Arrow's brooding ego.Finally, the big season-spanning story lines are elaborate and reasonably clever. Alternating the present-day story with flashbacks to Oliver Queen's 'lost' five years is a bit of a contrivance, but it works. We get two stories for the price of one, and we get to see Queen's character from two points of view.On the downside, there's just one problem: the endless, needless, melodramatic ANGST.The writers of Arrow seem to think that the hissy fit is the highest achievement of Shakespearean dramatics. Unfortunately, having everyone act like drama queens isn't the same as actual drama. These are supposed to be *strong* characters, yet they frequently lapse into behavior that would seem embarrassing in a kindergarten class for spoiled brats.A recent example (not much of a spoiler, even if you haven't see the third season finale): when Diggle finds out that Oliver has been working an elaborate deception, his first reaction is to get into a snit because HE wasn't told about it. This is a tough, mean, military dude. But instead of being relieved that his best friend hasn't been as completely off the rails as he seemed, Diggle is miffed because Queen dared to concoct a plot without letting him know. Oh, please!This happens not just regularly, but incessantly. In just about every episode, every character has a scene or two where they have a demeaning, vomit-inducing whine about some terrible affront that's been done to them.  Never mind that I've just been saved from the League of Assassins, the deadliest killers on Earth - nasty old Oliver told me a fib!! Wah, wah, poor little me!  Sometimes, supposedly mature characters (especially the tough veteran cop, Quentin Lance) maintain this kind of sniveling, juvenile attitude for many episodes, over some trivial circumstance that doesn't even qualify as a significant plot point.Despite this, I'm still a fan of the show. I think I deserve a lot of credit for that! I've managed to tune out all the whining, by gritting my teeth and occasionally closing my eyes. The fact that I've gone to those lengths is a testament to the really excellent aspects of this series. And, fortunately, there have been long stretches where actual plot takes over from the melodrama. That's when the true potential of Arrow shines through.I've just read that Arrow is slated to return for a fourth season. Wouldn't it be great if the writers grew up a bit over the summer, and found more adult ways for their characters to interact? If they did, Arrow could be a true classic.UPDATE: I'm revising my original 7/10 rating, all the way down to 2/10. Far from improving, this show has devolved into uninterrupted cliché and painfully contrived characterizations. Feeble on every level. Avoid. ","2"
"Arrow",2015-05-05," I used to love the show because it showed courage, bravery and friendship. It would be still a great show but they have to do something with laurel. Are you kidding me? She is annoying and not so fun to watch. Don't get me wrong she was awesome as a lawyer for the DA, but as a part of the TEAM pfff no way. Her sister Sara was awesome I loved her and it was unfortunate to see her die but please Don't take her place you. In summary I love the show and I think its great without Laurel being a part of the TEAM. Keep her as a lawyer but please don't make her fight crime. I cant wait to see what happens to Oliver as the daemons head ! ","5"
"Arrow",2015-05-05," I loved this show right from the beginning.on the first two seasons they related everything happens in the present with the story happened in the past.the action sequences are the best ones in the show.but some episodes feel like seeing the same things over and over but you will love the characters and the cast is so damn good.this is one of the best ones from DC.season 3 is not up to the expectations but however they managed to wind up the story line in a path and end it.If you guys wanted a good action flick and don't really care about the story a lot,this is a perfect show. ","8"
"Arrow",2015-04-29," Initially, I had no expectations on the show whatsoever. After viewing the first episode I thought the show was satisfying, good action, good story, but unrealistic, and too much like Batman. By watching more and more episodes, it becomes clear why that is that oliver queen is that strong.Just Finished watching First season and just watched 5, 6 Episodes of 2nd Season and Em surprised to watched every episode second season is full of thrill and entertainment.For me personally  Arrow is the best series on television. I can't wait for more! ","9"
"Arrow",2015-04-28," I began watching this series with a friend and at the beginning it seemed quite promising.But after the first season it started turning a sharp down-turn.Every five minutes a new forced,fake drama emerges,just so they fill the episode with something.Oliver is presented as green arrow after suffering on a helish island and from then on everyone who dies is not actually dead and appears miraculously later.Many bad guys who die....don't die...They come back again and again.Everyone familiar with Oliver pushes him around as much as they want and he just sits there speechless....No one can learn his secret but almost everyone now knows it and since every woman in his life is either a super hacking machine or a skilled warrior in some form of combat and weapon using(and of course at some point,despite other relationships,his sex-mate),sara dies and they don't know what to do so we go back to the beginning,faking deaths,arresting oliver for being the vigilante and getting him off the hook again....He is a master of suspection,sniffing everything out unless it concerns someone he knows.Then he gets totally dump and does nothing until damage's done.... Poor acting of many protagonists and too predictable...Too much of repeating... ","3"
"Arrow",2015-04-24," Yesterday I turned off Arrow, Season 3 episode 20, before finishing it. I couldn't bear it any more. The horrible storyline has no end. What could have been such a good show, has been ruined by extremely bad writing, which also in turn makes the actors look bad. The story is so unbelievably stupid, and I don't get why it can attract so many viewers each week. The first season of arrow was quite alright. The 2nd started to introduce some strange sh*t, which didn't really make sense, and it was like they were already running out of ideas (But at least they killed of Sarah, which was a horrible character). This 3rd season has just been nothing short of a nightmare. They are just ruining the show, and I wouldn't be surprised if it gets canned. This Rha's al Ghul bullsh*t, has been going on for far too long. Also, How can they keep going back to that sh*tty Island, it's beyond me. And please, why does every person in the show needs to be a vigilante and a master kung fu fighter?The only reason to watch this show, is if you like watching the flash, and you don't wanna miss any character progression. If you like these kind of shows, go watch the new Daredevil series. Really good story, Excellent acting and master-level fighting scenes. ","3"
"Arrow",2015-04-21," First off, I am a HUGE DC fan. DC characters, such as Batman, Wonder Woman, and the Green Arrow himself have always been my favorite characters, more than that so of Marvel, who I do also love. Although Batman has and will forever be my favorite vigilante or hero, Green Arrow has grown on me absolutely as a character, thanks specifically to this show.  Arrow  is a great take on a character that is often overlooked due to his  lack of physical intimidation .  Arrow  is gripping, interesting, and sticks to the character's origins and plot fully. The show leaves no loose ends of the plot untended. Each character, from my personal favorite Felicity, to the matriarchal Queen power, Moira Queen, as well as to the main character himself, Oliver Queen, is developed thoroughly, cast incredibly, and create such an intensity in only 42 minutes. The best aspect of the show ranges from being the fighting, the intelligence behind  The Hood , and the strong focus on Oliver's hardship of fitting back into Starling City as well as balancing his double life. The show puts a real world spin on a comic book character who not only shoots arrows with extreme accuracy, yet also manages to create complex relationships with his fellow supporting characters. I highly suggest this show not just to ANY and ALL comic book lovers, yet everyone in general; anyone who wants to see an action packed, wonderfully executed show should watch  Arrow . ","10"
"Arrow",2015-04-20," Actually i am a great fan of batman series. what attracted me towards batman is that he became a superhero by his own hard work and talent unlike superman, green lantern etc which are just stupid. Likewise when i saw arrow, i had the same feeling as when i saw batman. Oliver Queen has some similarities as Bruce Wayne. Like Oliver on disguising as Vigilante is saving starling city and Bruce Wayne on disguising as Batman is trying to save GothomCity. This series made me understand that the most sensitive weapon which yields a glamorous look is the bow and arrow. Being fascinated in the use of arrow in 'Arrow' i started going for archery classes. And you know something its actually amazing. When holding the bow in my hand i actually feels like a vigilante and my targets as the villains. If there is a series that could inspire you on archery, it is the series 'Arrow'. I'm not gonna tell you everything in this, I assure you that you would not regret on wasting time on watching 'Arrow'.Actually the 'Arrow series are becoming more interesting after each season and more surprises on the way....... ","10"
"Arrow",2015-04-16," It is very good series drama, with an interesting character development. One very spoiled boy, who thinks only about women and booze, endures 5 years in torture and life in a war situations, to turn him into humane, strong and compassionate human being, who wants to sacrifice his own life for the happiness and well being of others. It is also made kind of realistic, because good doesn't always win and the main characters often make mistakes, and are weak and human. Just to mention that no matter the series rotates around one man's battle to fight the evil, it has strong female characters, who have their own story arch and are brainy and beautiful and fight really well. ","10"
"Arrow",2015-04-11," I really wanted to like this series. I have been following each episodes of seasons 1 and 2 religiously. I also think that Stephen Amell's strong personality and feature fits the character of Arrow. But his acting is what concerns me. For one, he always look on the side while he's supposed to be talking with another character. He's obviously reading an idiot board. Two, the bedroom voice. I don't get why he always do that. Three, the too much flashback is just, too much. And four, the complications in the love story (Oliver-Laurel-Felicity- Ray) was too complicated. And I also found one episode very funny (I just forgot what episode number that was) when Thea was kidnapped while she was with Roy, to think that she already know self defense because Malcolm taught him already (not to mentioned she has killed Sara Lance then), she went with her abductor without a fight. ","5"
"Arrow",2015-04-10," I only watch these action soaps as complete series back-to-back and Arrow started off as a watchable series. I got through series 1 and enjoyed it enough to get season 2. OK it's a spoofy comic book style action series based on a formula of revenge and super heroes. Unfortunately by the time the series got to S02E07 the so called super heroes had become so inferior to the 'bad guys' that the ratio of good guys winning [10%] to the bad guys winning [90%] started to make me lose all interest in watching the rest of season 2 and certainly no enthusiasm to get seasons 3 and 4. It's a shame really that the writers of these series seem to lose their way, similarly the series 'Revenge' fizzled out after the first 2 seasons. ","4"
"Arrow",2015-04-09," The story-line - sucks The script - sucks The character depiction - pathetic; I mean a vigilante with feelings of remorse over killing the bad guys? Come on, it's either black or white never grey! How in blazes did this serial garner an 8.2 rating? To be fair, I could relate to the first few episodes. But at one point, it started to slide & I thought the whole of Starling City would end up as vigilantes. I stopped following it in the middle of Season 2. It just wasn't convincing enough to warrant my attention. The Arrow is a flop when compared to serials like the True Detective & Sons of Anarchy which are in a class of their own. ","1"
"Arrow",2015-04-04," Its both sad and rather ironic that after decades trying to distance Green Arrow from his status as nothing more than a Batman clone; DC has, through the Arrow series managed to make him more of a Batman clone than ever before. The arrow cave, the dark and gritty, that every major enemies he faces is a main Batman villain (or Nightwing villain). Culiminating ultimately in them taking some of the most defining events in the Batman comics such as the offer of the demon and giving them to Oliver Queen.Arrow is a great series, but it is beginning to really suffer due to their attempts to make the Arrow the new Batman.

"Arrow",2015-04-01," Actually, I don't like movies or series about superheroes. It looks for me boring. I had thought like that before I saw ARROW. I felt myself like a boy, uncovering new worlds. Good scenario, nice and smart artists, amazing legendary story about island. Now I know that not all stories about superheroes are boring. Perhaps it's because this hero more human, then superhero. He looks so seek as for superhero and haven't enough power to deal with problems very fast. He is very lucky sometimes, but it's part of incredible legend. Also he can be a good instance for fitness fans. In any case excellent project. Good luck, ARROW. ","9"

Slade Wilson tears Oliver apart he murders his mother, kidnaps his friends and creates an army of super soldiers with a Japanese drug from world war II. The Arrow, his teenage friend Roy Harper suits up as Arsenal, Black Canary and the police fight this army of super soldiers and imprison Slade on an isolated island. ","10"
"Arrow",2015-03-29," Easily the most boring superhero series ever created. Then again, its not like the Green Arrow comics are masterpieces. But this show takes it to a new level of boredom. 99% of the show is drama between really dumb people who act like high schoolers. It basically Buffy with almost 90% less action with everyone acting like they are 15 years old while being in their 30s. Even enemies are completely stupid and plots boil down to dumb and dumber.Cheap soap operas are at least funny due to how ridiculous the stories and acting are. This one is not funny, it is not smart, it has no suspense, and there are no redeeming characters anywhere. ","2"
"Arrow",2015-03-25," This show started off as a semi-decent spin off on Batman, yet in a matter of dozen episodes became the dullest and blandest show on television.Almost every episode brings a sad feeling of deja-vu: all characters, stories and  unexpected  turns of events were done and re-done at least hundred times in other places.Character development is non-existent. The whole thing rolls around the same dilemma of being a vigilante and dealing with personal problems, like PTSD(?), intimate relationships and continuous psychological breakdowns(e.g.  whining ).Acting is awful. So as script, actor selection, or even general direction in which show is going.Season 3 is the final nail in the coffin. I'm not even gonna rant about it - that's how bad it is...Oliver Queen - you failed this city. >>---> ","4"

Some fight scenes are a bit cheesy, and there a quite a few plot holes, with some good and some bad acting, and the writing has slipped a bit since season 3 started. but otherwise, it is quite a decent show, worth a watch. Actor Stephen Amell plays the role of the main superhero/vigilante Arrow, which is based on the DC comics superhero Green Arrow. The tone of the show is pretty gritty and the show is quite batman- esque. One of the better CW shows out there. Season 1 - 9/10 Season 2 - 9.5/10 Season 3 - 7.5/10Overall - 8.5/10 ","9"
"Arrow",2015-03-18," good acting , good writing , good editing , make a good show Arrow one of the most wonderful and awesome series , I love the mystery, the action, Especially with the arrow/flash crossovers. I do recommend Arrow 100%! GREAT SHOW. Stephen Amell gave a great performance and he is perfect for the role of Oliver Queen/Green Arrow.We've seen all the comic revivals from Marvel and this DC Arrow is pretty brilliant. I loved the show , cant wait for more episodes to come out , this is my favorite genre for TV shows ! Great show.love it .. I am going to keep watching this show and definitely can't wait for the new episodes!! ","10"
"Arrow",2015-03-17," I actually liked Arrow, this was me ignoring the bad acting for a couple of seasons, It had a nice story and all. But characters are getting annoying especially Lorel. I began to hate the show as it progressed, as there were so many useless episodes aka fillers. The story eventually warps into a Batman story even featuring batman characters but instead of Bruce Wayne, we have Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell) whose acting keeps getting on my nerves.So this was once an 8 for me, but characters are hardly likable, acting is questionable, story was good and all, but its not the Green Arrow's story, its Batman, or teen titans with their Deathstroke ARC. So its good to waste time on, but overall its not that great. ","5"
"Arrow",2015-03-12," The summary says it all. The story is engaging and keeps you guessing. The acting, however leaves something to be desired. I understand the showrunners wanted to use relatively unknown talent, but at what cost? Also, some of it is just absurd - I understand he's expertly trained in martial arts, but there's no excuse for Oliver being able to dodge well over 200 bullets in the first season alone. I mean, what archer goes guerilla and to take down baddies with big guns? There were better ways to approach that. Overall, the show is good. It starts off with some shaky acting, but it gets better fast. Overlook that, and it may become one of your new favorite series. Would recommend. ","7"
"Arrow",2015-03-05," WARNING! THIS TV-SERIES MAY COTAIN THE WORST SCENES AND ACTING YOU HAVE EVER SEEN ON SCREEN YOUR WHOLE LIFE. CONSIDER YOURSELF WARNED!I have tortured myself through the first season and ended at the third episode in season 2. Arrow is so bad that I would either cut my dick off, tape it to my forehead and walk around like an unicorn a whole day, than see another episode. They copy-paste Batman, the acting is terrible, the script is toilet paper. The only good thing is the sexiness of Laurel (Katie Cassidy). How on mother earth did this series got 8.2 in rating!? It is only 0.3 behind Homeland and 0.5 behind modern family! Please god, cancel this show for the sake of the human race.- Stayzor ","1"
"Arrow",2015-02-28," I have never written a review before but I decided I had to for Arrow. I think the beginning had an okay plot, with a normal beginning, except for Sara being Laurel's sister, Oliver being Laurel's girlfriend, Laurel being with Tommy, Oliver's best friend, etc. But then it got worse. People started to come back from the dead, people were actually someone else's daughters and and someone killed who or Felicity was dating another dude or whatnot. Most parts of the show around the end of season one and season two and three got crazy. I personally think this is because the writers panicked and wrote things in to try and make people watch it for the gasping new fact revealed every new episode. Or perhaps that was their plan all along. It just felt more like a crazy Korean drama than a vigilante show. Then the dialog. I could guess what they were going to say before they said it, and most of the time, I was right. It was so obvious what they were going to say, and this was funny at first, but when it kept going on and on, the show turned surprisingly boring. It made most people without character. Oliver Queen seems very dull, and I don't really get why people in the show keep calling him smart or sharp. Lastly, the flashbacks. After three seasons of it, you can know when it is going to happen, because of the style. I suppose this would be unification, but sometimes it seems too dull.I still watch the show. The plot isn't that bad when you take out the crazy family issues and terrible dates. The vigilante part is fun and you get pass the bad scripts with some of the shocking ones that make you gasp and scream and wait for the next episode. Some were bad, like Moira and her confession, but the newest one that I've watched was amazing with Ra's Al Ghul bringing one of the coolest cliffhangers yet.You get a love-hate relationship with Arrow. Sorry if I was mean. ","6"
"Arrow",2015-02-18," After watching the first 8 episodes of ARROW I stopped watching the show I thought it's complete garbage. A year after the bitter taste the show gave me I heard Barry Allen will be in the show aka the flash I got excited he was booked for 2x08 So I started watching the show from beginning, Somehow I didn't feel the bitter I get even more excited after watching another episode to another after finally catching up to the show I believe the show was in it's winter break I found myself counting the days for the next episode each week until now I do the same thing. NOW ARROW IS MY FAVOURITE SHOW!!. The show is in it 3rd season now. ","10"
"Arrow",2015-01-07," One of the lamest, most unconvincing pieces of video material I've been subjected to. My step-son said it was good so I gave it a try. It's shite. I've loved comics since early childhood so it's another reason why I thought this would appeal to me. It's so repugnantly fake I'm at a loss for words.You'll be hard-pressed to find a moment where you can get immersed and forget that it's obnoxious actors on screen that you're watching.I just don't know what else to add except to speculate what made it receive 8.2 rating from the audience. Women drooling over the protagonist? Kids into parkour and commercial tunes? I'm baffled. ","2"
"Arrow",2015-01-04," Oliver MAY NOT be dead , f**k series where the hero dies and to the half of the season . My wife and I will not watch the series if Oliver Queen not stay alive and return to the series through a maximum of two episodes so - giving time to change the scenario . Liven it in any way except for memories of other characters in the series. Oliver and Felicity have to be together and that we have not yet seen in the series. Atomic ( ant ) is Superman and that's what he needs to become in the series - if he has already put some superpowers . Now it turns out that all permanent characters in the series to become a super heroes which makes no sense .Just because the current craft shops in the series , giving the lowest rating. OLIVER BACK !!!!!! ","1"
"Arrow",2015-01-01," omfg i love this show with a passion! if I'm honest i found the first and maybe even the second episode on the boring side, but at the same time it has this draw that makes me click the next episode. being completely up to date now (the climb) i have loved the way this has been executed. although not having read the comics but extensively researching it, i found that have the right mix of sticking to the origin and also distinguishing themselves from it. i personally loved the introduction of Sara lance, and she was perfect for the role of the canary. i must admit I'm seriously unhappy that they killed her off but i hope they do not stop her appearances just yet.i really wanted to know more about Nyssa/Sara, but i have faith in the show as they really take on the fans opinions (deciding to keep Rickards as a series regular) definitely a show to watch! ","10"
"Arrow",2014-12-28," I just recently watched the series from beginning to the present episodes. Such promise. The show has slowly deteriorated into a sci-fi soap opera. To Oliver: Thea is not really your sister, she's your half sister from a man your mother had an affair with whom she now hates, or hated because she is now dead (or is she?). That man is dead now, or was dead and is now training your half sister to be a killer. Why did she stop hating him? Oh, and the love of her life Roy is being replaced by a DJ. Oliver's main concern is bedding every female in the cast while those around him slowly find out who he really is.The whole show reminds me of the Heroes series because it seems that week to week they don't know where the story is going so they change things at the drop of a hat and hope people go along with it.

"Arrow",2014-12-15," Arrow <U+0096> The TV series Arrow is a great program for fans of green arrow and lovers of the DC universe. The series tells a story about a young man named Oliver Queen, his farther, a sea captain and a young girl out on the ocean taking a cruise on their expensive boat when a storm strikes and kills the young girl. The rest of them escape unharmed drifting along the water hoping to find land. After many hours food starts to run out and there is only a small amount of water for one person. Oliver's farther decides to kill himself in order to save Oliver. As many days alone on the water Oliver find an island where he meets a Chinese hunter. On the island many things happen including becoming the Protector of central city, the arrow. ","9"
"Arrow",2014-12-13," This TV show is a amazing story. I love everything about it nothing has ever disappointed me at all. Oliver queen is the best vigilante's ever. Green arrow has never been seen this popular until arrow so it's a big + to there popularity. I think the romance is amazing. Also how they bring so much of the DC characters back in a new form. If your thinking of watching this please do. It inspired me to start making movies and TV shows. you will love the story to this you will love the characters you will love everything about it. Nothing is ever disappointing about this you are going to enjoy this a lot. Oliver queen is a 10 out of 10 on his abs. Oh one more thing He has a bow and arrow so cool. ","10"
"Arrow",2014-12-12," I was not a comic book nerd but this show made me one....well strictly speaking a nerd about green arrow *_* I started watching it 11 months ago in January 2014 when they were on a break after winter finale of 2nd season. The show captivated me from the 1st episode and i binged watch it through season 1 and 1st half of season 2 in just 3 days. It has a superhero with no superpowers....I'm not a fan of super powers.....So obviously i fell in love with it instantaneously. And cast is good too. Now a week long wait for a new episode seems like a year so obviously hiatus feels like centuries. My only complain is the number of filler episodes that are obviously necessary because a show can't retain quality throughout 23 episodes a season. Overall a good fun show that keeps me captivated throughout the hour. ","10"
"Arrow",2014-12-11," Okay, this show, the best in the world! I can never stop being a fan and the last episode, just blew me away! Seriously, why doesn't this show have a better rating? It needs to go up by at least .2 points. I got to say that I am angry because this show is beyond underrated. Like if I would have the power, I would have it at least a nine, a ten if I could. When I first saw the first episode, I was hooked. Like it literally captured me. The dialog was amazing, the action was even greater and it left me at a lot of questions that I just wanted to see more. Now I'm dazed like serious fan-boy dazed that I am distraught that this show doesn't have the rating it deserves. It needs to be at nine but I am not in control, please bring up awareness to increase this spectacular show's ratings. If we could raise it up by at least two points that would be great and thank you! ","10"
"Arrow",2014-11-27," Trying to remember this is public.. Series started as u would expect..and just went downwards.. there is so much to put the finger on..so i'm just gonna stick to Season 3 (whats came out anyway).. question 1: why does Oliver /Arrow behave like he's the only one that have been hurt/can cope with it?2: Why does Oliver/Arrow still mean and enforce that  i'm gonna spare his life no matter what ..even though that very same person is responsible for the deaths of several thousand people (that we know of in the series)..but hey he got to make out++ with a few girls /before they died),so..conclusion:Series started out promising..,but Hollywood decided to please people to much (again),making it to a love-storyand Marvel-heroes ain't made for such thing :) ","1"
"Arrow",2014-11-27," Its a well written story line up but the direction of the series makes it weak. Almost in every episode you can find the goof ups made by the director. Like in one of the episodes when Oliver meets Slade for the first time and spots the identical mask worn by his torturer, Slade tells him he was his parter. Then in one of the episodes when Slade was talking about his partner oliver was shocked and told him the guy who tortured me was your partner. So either Arrow has Alzheimer or just one of the many goof ups in this TV series. A better direction can make it one the best TV shows. Also the cast, seriously the producer needs to reconsider all his plans before launching another TV series in future. ","6"
"Arrow",2014-10-08," This show has developed it's own dialogue concerning  it gets better.  I just don't understand how simply introducing a  new  character and having Arrow fight him magically changes the dialogue or acting.I think at best, it can be said that there are a few interesting enough characters, and if you nod your head to the idea that comic book adaptations are going to be cheesy, then you you get something that solely passes on a network like CW.The  defense  of the show I never really hear. It amounts to  you don't get it! Everyone likes different things! Flashbacks and notable characters from the story are cool! Sometimes a death of a major character you can feel in your gut. Sometimes even a supporting character can leave you on edge once they're axed. In this setting, a story telling tool like that felt gimmicky.Ironically, I think there's a ton of redundancy in the story telling and as many arbitrary danger scenarios, presumably for one more chance to say  you have failed this city.  The black and white mask guy, Diggle, and the computer nerd girl are the only ones that seem to remain consistent or have clear motivation. I've consistently disliked Arrow and I think it's because I want his face to move.A small comparison between this an Agent's of Shield. When Sky got shot, I was worried. Independent of the kinda crap first season, the idea that she could be offed made me concerned about how the saga and story would continue. In Arrow, even the characters I marginally like, I can't remember their names and couldn't count how many times I'm supposed to have believed they were in danger or be dead. And I still don't care either way. ","6"
"Arrow",2014-10-03," *This is a review for the the Seasons 1 and 2 of Arrow *Minor spoilers for Seasons 1 & 2 presentAs you may know, Arrow is a show based off of the Green Arrow & The DC Comics Universe. As a big fan of the DC universe, I was a little sketchy after seeing bits and pieces of the 1st season on TV. In the short term it seemed like the Punisher with a bow & arrow, however that was before I sat down and watched the whole show.After watching two seasons of Arrow, I can happily say that Arrow is the most faithful live- action adaptation of the DC Universe to date. Sure it makes a few changes (the biggest being the characterization of Green Arrow), however over all Arrow has the stories, characters, super-powers, and the overall feeling of a huge expanded universe that DC fans have loved since 1938.The characters on Arrow are (for the most part) intriguing and faithful to the comics. Firstly, there is Oliver Queen, The Arrow, played by Stephen Amell. From the beginning, Oliver has a sense of mystery to him. At first he seems very different from his comic book counter-part, however as the story unfolds you begin to realize that he is headed there. It takes a few episodes for the actor to warm up to the role, but once he does, you begin to root for him and understand the decisions he makes. However, the Arrow does not fight alone as he has partners in John Diggle (David Ramsey), Felicity Smoak (Emily Bett Richards) & Roy Harper (Colton Haynes). Each character mentioned is a great character that adds to the show, and has you rooting for them as much as you are The Arrow. DC fans will not recognize Diggle or Felicity (unless your a die-hard Firestorm fan) as they are made up for the show. However, not to worry as they are some of the best characters on the show. DC Fans will of course recognize Roy Harper, as the Green Arrow's side-kick Speedy (or Arsenal or Red Arrow). Many fans of the show do not enjoy this character, however he is one of my personal favorite and I love what Roy adds to the show (he is also the only person to ever argue with Arrow, witch I love).That being said a show is only as good as it's villains, luckily Arrow has great villains. There have been many villains on Arrow, however I am only going to talk about the main 2 for the sake of time. (That being said, I must add that Deadshot, Brother Blood, Nyssa Al Ghul, & The Dollmaker are all great villains as well). The big bad of season one is (spoilers for any one not past episode 9) Merlyn, The Dark Archer. Merlyn's story is changed a bit. However, it is for the better as The Merlyn of the show is a much better character than the Merlyn of the comics. John Barrowman adds a certain charisma to Merlyn that makes you exited every-time he is on the screen. The villain of season 2 is (spoilers for Season 2) Deathstroke. Most of Slade's backstory is intact in the show. Even though his motivations are a little sketchy, Manu Bennet represents Deathstoke as the intimidating, venganful, and bad-ass character that we all know and love from the comics so all is forgiven.However, Arrow is not perfect. The 1st 7-8 episodes are engaging, but can be off-putting to some and not leave a good impression. However, I highly recommend that you stick with the show as it gets leagues better for the last half of Season 1 & All Of Season 2. The other main problem with Arrow is the Lance sisters, Laurel & Sara. It seems like the writer's just don't know what to do with Laurel. Although, Katie Cassidy tries her hardest to make the character work, the way the writers handle her is pretty brutal. I really hope they fix her for Season 3 (though they seem to be on the right track as I know she will be training with Wildcat). Sara has the opposite problem. The way she is written is usually pretty good, however the actress who plays her is just awful. Some of her line delivery is literally unbearable, to the point where she actually ruined an episode (S02E15, The Promise) for me.Overall, Arrow is a fun show and a great adaptation of the DCU that I look forward to watching every week, and I would gladly encourage any DC fan to check out Arrow to see there favorite characters such as The Flash, Deathstroke, Arsenal, The League Of Assasians, Deadshot & The Suicide Squad done justice on screen.*Also, I would just like to encourage everyone to like Stephen's facebook page as he is honestly the kindest, most down to earth I have ever seen. His donations to various charities is honestly amazing. Also, he reveals little tidbits of info on upcoming Arrow episodes as well. ","9"
"Arrow",2014-09-19," I wasn't expecting much from this show in the beginning, but I was pleasantly surprised. The scenes are short, tight and pack a punch. There is rarely a slack moment and the plot lines have considerable emotional resonance. As is typical of CW shows, it's full of gorgeous twenty- somethings with perfect cheekbones and impeccably coiffed hair, but that's just a bonus.In two seasons, Arrow has gone from strength to strength. The villain-of-the-week episodes are now interwoven with long-running story lines. Some of the second season episodes--Keep Your Enemies Closer, Three Ghosts, and Tremors--stand out as some of the best pieces of television in the last seven or eight years. Though they occasionally veer too far into comic-bookiness, the stories have become even more compelling<U+0097>in fact, sometimes I even wish there were more character scenes and fewer fights.It never ceases to amaze how the showrunners manage to squeeze the maximum out of a TV budget every single week. Not since Miami Vice has there been a show that aimed for--and so often achieved--the ideal of a TV series as an hour-long mini-movie, delivered once a week for the viewer's delectation. Often big-budget Hollywood movies feel bloated and weighed-down by all the money spent on special effects; Arrow is freed, its creativity stimulated, by the need to work within a smaller budget. The visuals are gritty and imaginative and the fight scenes are always wonderful to watch.Unlike most CW shows (ahem, Smallville) which aim for a more emo sensibility, or the angry-young-man nihilism which afflicted Nolan's Batman movies, Arrow strikes a more mature tone. Themes of loyalty, revenge, love, honor, family ties, sibling rivalries, friendship, betrayal, Oedipal struggle, motherhood, absent fathers, guilt, redemption, class struggle, the dichotomy between the mask one wears and one's true self, and more--pulp fiction it may be, but treated with loving care by the writers, showrunners, and actors. This combination of heightened emotional intensity with the comic book mythos elevates Arrow to something like opera: a world of stylized, epic, larger-than-life conflicts, but which is still recognizably human and compelling. And it's addictive.The powers that be at CW have fortunately renewed the series for a third season and I'm eager to see if they can manage to take the story of Oliver Queen to new heights. I hope the show runs as long as they can make it interesting. ","9"
"Arrow",2014-09-16," I watched  Arrow  for a bit and made it only until episode 19 of the first season. The concept of a guy who was trapped on an island and managed to escape it to fight crime is very good and exciting. During the episode they tell more and more about what happened on that island, which is a very good way of keeping the viewer interested in the show.But after a while I got really annoyed with the terrible acting in Arrow until the point it's totally impossible to take the actors and the storyline seriously.My advise is, try to watch the show. You will see for yourself if the acting annoys you. If you don't mind the bad acting then this is a good show for you. But for me it's a 5/10. ","5"
"Arrow",2014-09-10," Solid start to what could--and maybe should--be a future CW franchise. Your interest in Arrow depends on how much you miss the troubled-in-love, conflicted-by-family heroics of Smallville--it mirrors that series' setup. The pilot of Arrow is a darkly gleaming gem. If the show can keep up its cinema-quality action sequences and maintain an air of mystery to Ollie's agenda, this could be a really fun series. Arrow has a rather stylish neo-Goth look, and Stephen Amell (who played a dim-bulb gigolo in Hung) neatly balances his portrayal of Arrow between camp and Saturday-matinée ingenuousness. There's nothing particularly new about a superhero show, but Arrow exhibits a stylized ferocity that, in its initial hour at least, makes a positive enough impression. Arrow may not be a-point-meant television. But for starters at least, it's a sharper little tale than expected. ","8"
"Arrow",2014-09-07," I only recently discovered the series and just love Arrow! But love it even more when watching it on DVD, because then I can just forward through all of Laurel's scenes. I wonder if the creators feel sorry for the actress and that's why they can't kill her character? Hmmmm I sincerely hope they do though.Otherwise, nice action, some humour and overall fun to watch. Felicity is definitely my favourite character, simply because she's funny and nerdy. PS: I do not know the comics, so my judgement is purely based on the series. ","7"
"Arrow",2014-09-05," The first series was great with plenty of action and a reasonable storyline. Then in series two, the action scenes got sanitised and the storyline was adapted to reduce the amount of killing and the Arrow became an idiot whose snap decisions always play into the hands of the baddies. A pitiful storyline and plenty of overacting means episodes became cringe-worthy. I don't know exactly how these series are managed, but it seems that after the first series, Arrow has been assigned lazy script writers who judging by the amount of melodrama and teenage angst, previously wrote for 90210! Arrow has entered the realm of comedy with one character pointing a shotgun and calling somebody an  asshat , presumably for the benefit of viewers that get offended by strong language... sheesh! I got sick of characters second guessing themselves and entering stupidity loops,  Oh, if only I hadn't told that lie then everything would be OK, so now I'll tell another lie and that'll sort it out. Oh no, if only I hadn't told that second lie then everything would be OK, so now I'll tell another lie...  you get the picture... Repeated historical revelations used to provide storyline twists became tiresome, as they ended up being predictable as lazy story artefacts always do. Bottom line is that the IQ of Arrow has dropped significantly so if you're new to it, watch the first series then move on and forget it. ","5"
"Arrow",2014-08-27," When I started to watch the show I really didn't like the regular  story from the past  insertions. But sadly, after more and more episodes, those became actually far more interesting that the main story. Then I stopped watching. it really felt that I can just watch any episode in any order and I wouldn't even know if I had seen it or not. It was all so cookie cutter. The main character is not bad, but then it goes pretty down from there. Now I realize that the entire series was written by a bunch of 12 y o during their summer break. There can be no other explanation for the mind bogglingly inane  plot  that tries to carry this series through. Pap is too good a word for this garbage ! ","2"
"Arrow",2014-08-22," Great show! Arrow is a great mix of multiple genres, it is action packed and exciting, yet emotional and can be a little romantic. The casting in this show is so perfect, Stephen Amell is the perfect actor for Oliver as he is a park our expert and does all his own stunts making this show realistic. This show has a great soundtrack as well as a great catch line. You will find yourself quoting this show. There are those people that will say they don't like this show and I really don't understand them and wouldn't listen to them. This show is exciting for anyone, almost addicting! Overall this show is exciting and suspenseful, and a great show to watch anytime! ","10"
"Arrow",2014-08-14," If you take the time to notice, all of the bad user ratings are from users that only watched the first 3 episodes. The story has to be set up and of course the first 3 episodes of every show is a little rocky. Once the show gets in the mode of things and the plot develops, the show burns into an intense crazy fire of a plot that will be the only thing on your mind for weeks. It's a fantastic show with fantastic writing and a very talented and carefully chosen cast. Give it a chance. Though the story is very much not the same as the comic series green arrow, I would never imagine it any other way. This portrayal is very dense and contains many possibilities to branch out. Personally I think it is the best thing to happen to DC since Batman. ","10"
"Arrow",2014-08-08," Loved it.. watched all 46 episodes in less than 2 weeks! (and stayed up last night watching 8 episodes in a row!)Season 1 was exciting, but in Season 2, while the writers upped the stakes ante; during the last few episodes, Oliver/The Arrow began to become really foolish in his decision-making :( Your reticence to do what is necessary, is why your city burns!  To me, Nyssa summed up Oliver and Season 2 pretty well.While i love many of the supporting characters like Felicity, Roy, Sara, Tommy, Detective Lance and Diggle, it was really annoying to see how the skillful Oliver Queen turns out to be such an elementary playboy, (he actually slept with his father's mistress!!) and making more and more useless decisions that leave dear ones suffering. A disappointing lead character to root for. ","9"
"Arrow",2014-08-07," I am entirely surprised as to this shows rating. At this moment in time the rating is at a 8.2. This compared to a show like Deadwood which is at a 8.9.Now Deadwood was an examination in the creation of civilization out of a savage land. Filled to the brim with good actors inhabiting multifaceted and complex characters that touted amazing dialog.Could one expect some of the same from Arrow. One could but only with ensuing disappointment.I have now seen the first season and I won't be moving forward with season 2. Granted this 2nd season might take a quantum leap in quality. But I highly doubt it.As a lot have pointed out. Arrow is basically Batman Begins in TV form. This could've been exciting if it weren't for the huge difference in quality.I love characters. Unfortunately these characters pretty one dimensional even though they do evolve slightly over the cause of season one. Unfortunately they never really become real people because of their one note personalities. The show tries to create complexity but fails. It doesn't help that the actors for the most part aren't particularly fantastic. The chemistry between the supposed friends, lovers, family members also leave a lot to be desired. Needless to say I had a hard time finding a real character to empathize with.The dialog is very stiff and unengaging, which again doesn't help when the different characters are struggling with finding chemistry with each other.The plots are for the most parts predictable and clichéd. It's like the writers have studied a very traditional story model and lack the fantasy to try something new. There are plot holes abound and more than a few unexplained events.Not everything is bad. As the show does manage to create a hook for the viewer. A hook that would've worked better if the characters had been deeper and easier to sympathize with. The show reveals new tidbits about the main protagonists road to becoming Arrow for every episode. Which is a pretty good hook instead of the formulaic setup of finding a new villain for every episode.But for the most part this show, at least through season 1, is a lackluster and clichéd outing with one note characters and forgettable plot.

"Arrow",2014-08-06," Is it just me or this series is just going down the drain, every character is getting awfully WHINY as each episode is completed..... If it goes at the same rate, this show will probably take the honours of he WHINIEST show out there... When the show started off I thought it was just Laurel, but it was understood as almost every story out there has to have someone like that to make sure a segment of viewers stay interested. But then there was Thea.... even that was agreeable to a certain extent as she's a confused just out of teens kid. But then somehow the Lead character Oliver begins to whine about everything happening in the city is his mistake instead of doing what he was supposed to do ... WTH!!!! ","1"
"Arrow",2014-08-02," OK first, I'm assuming anyone who gave this series a 10 IS 10...as in years old.2nd...wow, how can something this bad be on so long? Acting, writing...meh, not a prerequisite in the making of Arrow. Apparently, just watching and ripping off Batman Begins, (and really...a bad rip off...can't even get that right) is all that's needed.Where to start.Acting: Apparently good looks trump any effort to act. I'd say they were phoning it in, but really, that would imply they have another gear. They don't.Writing: See Batman Begins....rip it off in many, many unimaginative ways.Target audience: 10 years old and less. Is there no law that protects them from this show? Parents, do your job!Please don't watch this show. It makes Dukes of Hazzard look Shakespearean. ","1"
"Arrow",2014-06-28," Arrow is a good live-action superhero show. Seems slightly unrealistic but what show about superheroes is ever completely believable. It feels like a fairly dark show but is nevertheless compelling. After each episode I keep wanting more.Super happy to see Willa Holland and Katie Cassidy back on TV after their respective shows ended. They're great young actresses with lots of style and beauty. As for the man-candy, Stephen Amell does a great job at portraying the sexy billionaire playboy Oliver Queen who sets out on a mission to clean up the city. Two words  Totally Hot! There is a big budget movie feel to the show but it is completely necessary to tell the story. It's a very solid addition to the superhero action genre. ","8"
"Arrow",2014-06-28," This show is by far my favourite show on television. It's a great new take on the green arrow storyline. The way they handled this new batman type green arrow is so great. The villains are perfect and so are the story lines that are used. Stephen Amell is perfect for the role and in my opinion is better than Justin Hartley. In fact the green arrow used in this show is better than the one used in smallville overall. After watching this show I would be really excited to even see a movie based off of this. A lot of episodes were handled extremely well like seeing red for example that is my favourite episode because of the epic feel that they were able to add in. While I was watching this show I was watching smallville at the same time and I have to say I prefer this show so much more. So I would definitely recommend you to watch this show the whole way through because it's just going to get better and better. ","9"
"Arrow",2014-06-26," OK, so this show is not high art or even art at all, but it's great fun and easy on the eyes. The plot gets hopelessly muddled, the dialog is downright silly, but who cares as long as Stephen Arnell takes his shirt off once in awhile. I do wish this show didn't take itself so seriously, would give the audience a little wink once in awhile.  Yeah, we know this is pure camp, but we don't care.  (Kind of like the old Batman, if anyone remembers) However, the actors keep up the facade that the world (or Starling City) is coming to an end, and the only answer to Bad Guys With Guns and Nuclear Weapons and Other Devices of Mass Destruction is One Handsome Dude with a Bow. Exploding arrows help too. ","7"
"Arrow",2014-06-23," It is not the best show on TV (that takes a LOT for me to rate something best), but darned good. It draws you in, is intense, intelligent, and gives lots of plot twists. Characters are believable, have flaws, and epic like in any super-hero universe. They go a long way to make it seem  realistic  - which I like if it's done well. My pet peeve, as a computer expert, is the computer feats are still squarely in the realm of science fiction, but that's OK - it's not overdone too much. (I wonder how much Microsoft paid for their Surface product placement?)Definitely worth watching, but beware - if you do, you will have to watch the whole thing or you won't be able to sleep at night! ","8"
"Arrow",2014-06-16," The only one thing that pisses me up every single time when i watch the series, and I do watch them all because other this problem the series itself is watchable.What's with the masks? Wouldn't you recognize your own sister or brother who is wearing nothing but a cloth over her/his eyes?! i mean Sarah talks funny and has a distinguishing chin mark and accentuates funny as well. Don't get me started with Queen! The chap is always with a beard thing just like when he is not the arrow and has that very distinguishing mole next to his lower lip! He is talking in broad daylight with everybody wearing a hood with his eyes covered, with the beard + the mark on his chin! I just find this hilarious, no effort put in to over think this matter and have them wear a proper disguise! I just feel silly whenever I see the Heroes talking to their families and nobody can recognize them, obviously the script won't allow them but normally you would of course recognize them entirely! Silly silly silly. ","8"
"Arrow",2014-06-15," Well to start off i want to say that i like the show, in general. The action is great, love the story too. But there are some things that really bother me. The interaction between the characters is just awefull. For example: They blame the main character that he's too selfish, too much of an asshole really. Guys... HE JUST CAME BACK FROM LIVING ON AN ISLAND ALONE, GIVE HIM SOME TIME!!!All the characters in this show are socially awkward/handicapped so it seems.If this show would have gotten some better writers for the dialogs and character development, this show would have a 9/10 ","7"
"Arrow",2014-05-07," I have a strange relationship with the DC Comics non-super-powered superhero (or costumed crime-fighter/vigilante, if you want to be vulgar) the Green Arrow, created in 1941 by Mort Weisinger and George Papp, and who first appeared in  More Fun Comics #73. I first read of the Green Arrow about five years ago when he was first teamed up with the Hal Jordan version of the Green Lantern in an acclaimed - albeit short - run of ground-breaking, socially-conscious comics by comic book artists Neal Adams and Denny O'Neill. In researching the character further, I've found that up until the acclaimed Silver Age  Green Lantern/Green Arrow  stories, that the Green Arrow was regarded as a second- or third-tier superhero (an  archer-themed Batman,  if you STILL want to be vulgar), until Neal Adams gave the character a much-needed image overhaul in 1969, making him  rougher, darker, and edgier  and a spokesman for the under-privileged in American society (and left-wing politics, if you still want to bother being vulgar).After that, the last I heard of the Green Arrow - who is routinely regarded as the finest archer superhero comics has ever seen, perhaps only to be rivaled by Marvel Comics' Hawkeye - was quite sporadically over the following years in my own curious personal research of the character, and then I heard about The CW's new TV series  Arrow. Of course, due to my work schedule at the time, I had missed any chance of seeing the show when it aired on TV. So with the wonder of TV-on-DVD, I finally got the chance to watch it. One thing I was afraid of going in, was that the producers would take a  Dark Knight  approach to it to make the show  dark & edgy,  as is all the rage these days regarding superhero movies and TV shows. Thankfully, I knew beforehand that the Green Arrow had gone the  Dark Knight  route a long time ago. Superhero movies/TV shows need to innovate, not imitate, each other, if it is a genre to continue being one of the last places for truly original and innovative filmmaking.In watching  Arrow,  it is obviously inspired by the Neal Adams-Denny O'Neill Silver Age revision of the character that made the Green Arrow a much more dangerous and rougher superhero than he was when he first debuted during the Golden Age of comics, in addition to some of the more recent  Green Arrow  comic book stories (penned most famously by Mike Grell). At the beginning of  Arrow,  billionaire Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell) returns to Starling City after being marooned on an island in the South China Sea for five years.Five years before, Oliver was an irresponsible, reckless playboy with no ambition and who had cheated with the now-deceased sister of his girlfriend Dinah Laurel Lance (Katie Cassidy), whose cop-father Detective Quentin Lance (Paul Blackthorne) also holds a strong animosity toward him. Upon his return to Starling City, he's come back to civilization a changed man and with an agenda to take down the individual members of the city's wealthy elite who have corrupted it. Donning a green hood and a bow & arrow, he thus becomes the Green Arrow (though in an effort to make this series more  realistic,  I guess, he is never referred to out-right as  the Green Arrow,  and is instead often called  the Hood  or similar), a modern-day Robin Hood (who, like the Democrats - according to one character - steals from the rich and gives back to the poor) who's aided in his dangerous battle against crime with his former bodyguard John Diggle (David Ramsey) at his side, as well as IT geek-girl Felicity Smoak (Emily Bett Rickards). Arrow  is a good show to get into, if you're one for superhero movies and TV shows with a dark, menacing edge. For the record, I'm not, except for when it fits the character. I like dark comic book superheroes (and violent anti-heroes) like Batman, The Crow, The Punisher, or Spawn just fine and without any problems whatsoever. When the Green Arrow became a  darker, edgier  character, that was one of the few character revisions that I feel actually made the character a much better and more intimidating comic book superhero presence.I can honestly say that I'm waiting to see where this series goes in the future.9/10 ","9"
"Arrow",2014-05-02," I've seen 44 episodes of Arrow and I can't wait for the next. After every episode you keep wanting more. There are 2 episodes left in the second season and it's getting very exciting to watch. I like the fact that you get 2 different story lines the one in the past and the one in the present. This way you get to see how Oliver became the ARROW and you get more information on things that are happening in the present.The one thing I don't like is that the acting isn't what you'd expect from a series as good as this. It all feels very fake.All in all I very much like the show and if you get past the mediocre acting it's very good to watch. ","7"
"Arrow",2014-05-02," When I first started watching Arrow, I thought it was pretty good, but as I kept watching I realized the plot is somewhat familiar. That's right, Arrow is basically The Dark Knight Trilogy, but in a TV series. Oliver Queen a playboy millionaire that owns a successful company? Sound Familiar? It should because that's Bruce Wayne. They both went off the grid for a period of time and came back with survival and fighting skills to defend their city from crime. Now I know that's not the shows fault for having similar backgrounds, it's DC's. If you watch the show you'll understand this: 1) Oliver Queen = Bruce Wayne: No explaining needed 2) John Diggle = Alfred Pennyworth: They both act as their conscious 3) Felicity Smoak = Lucius Fox: High Tech people who get them what they need whether it's a new suit or hacking into something 4) Count Vertigo: wannabe Joker: Though Vertigo plays a smaller role, you could see the similarities in personalities 5) Isabel Rochev = Talia Al Ghul (Miranda): Act like the superhero's friend/lover and ends up backstabbing them 6) Malcom Merlyn = Ra's Al Ghul: The undertaking = Ra's Al Ghul's plan to destroy Gothom and start from the feet up (Black Canary)Sara Lance = Catwoman (Selena Kyle): Sara Lance acts as Oliver Queen's lover/ accomplice while Catwoman in the Dark Knight Trilogy is only an accomplice, though in The end of The Dark Knight Rises, you see Selena Kyle with Bruce Wayne 7) Officer John Blake (Robin) = Roy Harper (Speedy): Roy does have a bigger role especially now since he's been injected with the Mirukuru 8) Mayor Blood = Dr. Crane (Scarecrow)/ Two-Face (Harvey Dent): wears a similar mask to the scarecrow, used drugs on people and are both corrupt while appearing to be one of the  good guys . Also Mayor blood is well, the mayor and Dent was the DA plus they both dated/had a thing with the superhero's ex-lover 9) Slade Wilson (DeathStroke) = Bane: though they have different motives, they have pretty similar goals, they want to destroy something. Bane wants to destroy Gothom while Wilson wants to destroy Queen. They both work with the backstabbing girls 10) Quentin Lance = Jim Gordon, officers that work with  vigilantes  even though they're not supposed to 11) Laurel Lance = Rachael Dawes, both of them are ex-lovers The only reason why this show got a 5 and not lower is because I absolutely loved the Dark Knight Trilogy. It would've gotten a higher rating maybe if the CGI and acting was better. ","5"
"Arrow",2014-04-28," This show is a breath of fresh air in terms of vigilante stories that I have seen. The story is compelling with fantastic acting although at times it falls short of the mark in some fight scenes where it seems as though there should be more injuries/casualties.In terms of seasonal quality I feel as though  Arrow  only improves each season it airs. Season One was superb and I felt as though it would decline in quality but it just feels as though it is getting better and expanding so well. The actors in it are spot on too, they put the characters across well with their physique and to this point I haven't found any faults with the acting. Overall the show is a must watch at the moment if you have enjoyed any sort of Superhero movie/show in the past and a must watch in general if you enjoy action TV shows. ","9"
"Arrow",2014-04-27," I myself was a huge Smallville back in the day and I really enjoyed the episodes when Oliver Queen as the Arrow was in it. So after seeing the show end, I was really glad that they made a brand new show just for the Arrow. At first I was disappointed because the same guy who played the arrow from Smallville was not reenacting it. But, I soon became to love the acting of Stephen Amell. I think that he does a great job with his part of being Oliver Queen. I would like to see this series go on for a long time. Maybe if it gets enough viewers as long as the Smallville series which lasted about 10 seasons. That would be great! If you like movies that are adventurous with some romance in it too this is a great TV series to start watching. Also it is that type of TV show that keeps you on your toes every time you watch it. ","10"
"Arrow",2014-04-24," Wow, I just discovered this show on Netflix. I am a mother of 2 teenage boys, we all enjoy the show. There is a balance between action and drama and the foreshadowing is subtle. The actors are so sincere and believable, you forget it is a TV show. The story is great and each show leaves you anxious for the next. I can't stop thinking about it during my day. Of course, I also love the scenes between Oliver and Laurel. I watched the seen where Oliver tells Laurel that he is ready to leave the island 3 times. It was so sincere, and you could feel his heartache, and the music choice was perfect. Then I had to watch the scene where Oliver and Laurel finally get together, Ep 22, a couple more times. I had waited all season for that! It took my breath away and brought tears to my eyes. Yes, the scene was that good. Now I have to watch season 2. You guys are doing an awesome job with this show. I can't wait for more! ","10"
"Arrow",2014-04-23," Amazing show, every week it gets better, never lets me down. Storyline is full of twists and turns but without getting overly complicated, sure to keep you interested,and the acting is very good. I especially like Amell, he did a great job acting as oliver, especially his stone coldness upon arrival home and also the progressive change in his personality in becoming a better man. Worth checking out at the very least if you are interesting, hand to hand combat is very well choreographed and played out. Good special effects and stunts. The only bad thing about it now, is that there is no way they can possibly make it even better next season. Or can they... ","10"
"Arrow",2014-04-20," I found the first season of Arrow very entertaining and watched the first season twice - enjoying it even more the second time. The second season to me started a bit slow, I found Lora a bit annoying but I always have and I was not very keen on Sarah, but now I like her as its nice the Oliver has someone now, and the season's pace has picked up nicely. In the last two episodes I watched, I was literally sitting on the edge of my seat. I really hope it continues on as it has, though I would prefer it if the Arrow would get back to killing people more, this goody-goody routine is a little to mellow for me, but this is my personal taste, and the second season as a whole is starting to turn out quiet enjoyable. ","10"
"Arrow",2014-04-12," I have to say from day one of watching this series it became an addiction! This show is so awesome and you never know what to expect next. Watch this show on your own don't take anyone's negative comments about it as an indication to not watch it because you'll be surprised how good it actually is!!! I hadn't heard of it tell after it was already into season 2 so I went back and started from episode one and I became so into the show and how well it was made that I zoomed through season one within a couple days. The cast is fit for each part that they play and they do it well you'll begin the become attached to them throughout the episodes. This is defiantly a 10 out 10! and I hope to see more a more seasons cause honestly I cant see this show ending. ","10"
"Arrow",2014-04-03," When I first heard about this show, I'll admit that I was very excited, but never in my wildest dreams would I imagine that this show would be this perfect. From the first episode it draws you in, and until now, its only getting better and better. This show is an absolute masterpiece in every way, the writing, the acting, the environments, the drama, everything. I can without a doubt say that this is my favorite show of all time as I put it above my other favorites, Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead, and Supernatural. Arrow will always have a place in my heart, and I simply cannot imagine this show ever coming to an end, at least for a very long time. ","10"
"Arrow",2014-04-02," I've watched four or five episodes of this because my roommate says it's  the best show ever.  I can't imagine what he finds entertaining about this. It's standard-issue boilerplate network TV, chock-full of cookie-cutter dialogue, wooden acting (especially by the lead actor), stock situations you'd expect to see in any adventure show ... in fact I would say this is one of the worst shows I've ever seen.Frankly, I'd rather balance my checkbook or work on my income tax than sit through another 30 minutes of this pitiful excuse for a show. In fact, my roommate is watching it now, while I've found refuge in my office to ... ah, balance my checkbook. Trust me, it's far more entertaining than  Arrow.  ","1"
"Arrow",2014-04-02," This series started really awesome for me in the first 10 episodes, but the choreography is just bloody awful, which as it progresses, will make it less and less and less and less interesting to watch... I mean come on... the punches which are being  dodged  are aiming like a third of a meter above the villain's head, not to mention the slowness of the moves itself... Don't wanna be the critic here, but it's just to obvious. Acting however is great, from almost everyone. If they replace the fight scenes guy this show has the potential to surpass literally everything out there with the new villain lineup that's coming on. I haven't watched the last 5 episodes, but I am gonna, just because of the drama around it, not the fights... ","7"
"Arrow",2014-03-31," The very First episode was really good and after that no-one was able to stop me from watching it for hours until I watched till season two ! Great Series and LOVE IT !Keep up the Good Work !They did a great job on making the 'Arrow' series ! But I did not like, Laurel Lance as a character, not being rude but, she is really bad/a b***h !But the rest of the characters are really good This the first time I have seen a good Action/ Adventure series after a Long, long, time.I just hope they publish their episodes a bit more frequently !P.S. can you include some other villains also ! Please ! ","9"
"Arrow",2014-03-29," Arrow starts off well and is, for the most part, quite entertaining. The story of the origins of the Arrow in season 1 is very compelling, but the present day is not as interesting. As the first season rolls into the 2nd there's some interesting character development for Oliver/Arrow as he moves into a more traditional comic book hero. The first 10 episodes of that season(2) are the best of the show. They bring in a lot of good aspects from the DC universe. Unfortunately they start to go downhill again in the later part of season 2. The biggest problem the show has is the dialogue and the way characters express themselves. No character ever keeps anything to themselves that isn't an established secret. Rather than just feeling something the character always has to, often needlessly, express it in words.*minor spoilers* In the later part of season 2 there's been a cross into what I'd call 'insultingly stupid' occurrences. There's an episode involving a drone strike where a military drone is flying 10 feet off the ground, down a street for example. Felicity the computer specialist is frequently involved in the plot of an episode. The quality/enjoyment of the episodes are often damaged by how terrible writing is on with anything involving computers. The worst offence being a villainous computer expert hacking into computer equipment and making it explode. (A writing device I'd hope we'd left in the past many years ago) Overall the show is just barley worth watching. It's a bit of a mixed- bag on an episode-to-episode basis. It has its good moments and some good characters, but has some problems reconciling a dark/gritty tone with its Green Arrow and DC universe roots. ","6"
"Arrow",2014-03-28," We are now past the halfway point of Season 2 and I can say for sure that  Arrow  is the best superhero series ever and one of the best series in television. Arrow is a realistic take on the hooded vigilante Green Arrow (seemingly influenced by Nolan's  The Dark Knight  Trilogy) and it proves to be exactly what we needed. The story of the show is exiting, suspenseful and manages to keep the adrenaline high on every second of an episode. The episodes themselves, connect very well to one another and we can see their relevance in the main continuity more and more as we approach the Season 2  Finale . The characters are interesting and all are well- developed. Each and everyone of them have their place in the show and we can see everyone in a shining moment. Also, Arrow does a great work with it's villains always managing to offer the hero and his team quite the challenge. The show's characters might differ in some ways from the comics in order to fit into this more realistic world, but this is done in a way that doesn't irritate comic book fans and keeps the average viewer interested. But for the hardcore fans, many famous comic book characters are introduced.Finally, Arrow's effects work really well. Choosing to use practical effects over CGI was a very good decision helping both the realistic look and the visual appeal of the show. The costumes look good and also match the tone. The soundtrack fits the episodes perfectly and, while it isn't a masterpiece, is still pretty nice.For me personally  Arrow is the best series on television, along with  Game of Thrones  and thats why it gets a straight 10/10 (Masterpiece) rating. ","10"
"Arrow",2014-03-19," First I just watched 2-3 episodes. Then it got interesting. I continued it. The I got addicted to it. Even I know it seems a mixture of superman, batman, spider man series..... but still it takes you a journey of a survivor. And best part is the plot which keeps you bonded as you just want to know what happened on that island. There are times when some episodes are really boring, but even though in next episode it recovers. Sometimes it lacks humor, but it is upon Felecity to fill out those gaps. I think she is trying her best. Stephen Amell completely justify his character. And for Paul Blackthorne, he is absolutely great. Maybe some viewers think it as same concept, but still execution is different & worth watching. ","7"
"Arrow",2014-03-13," Any one who read DC comics will tell you Green Arrow is a poor mans Batman so to speak... That being said. With all the copy-write garbage I am sure it is easier to get rights to make a green arrow show rather than a new batman show... This still doesn't excuse how horrible this thing is. A friend referred it to me as a great show with the Flash in it. They don't cover the Flash at all really. Just a short cameo with normal Barry Allen. I would encourage you to watch a daytime soap opera then watch this garbage and tell me the difference. The acting is horrible. The writing is so awful that it must be done by drunken monkeys. They randomly put a villain in the clock tower and Arrows crew wonders where he is. They should just move their headquarters there. If they ask Laural one more time IS SOMETHING WRONG i will punch my TV. ","1"
"Arrow",2014-03-09," While watching the first series of Arrow I noticed how many vigilante story clichés there are in it. I won't name any because I will give it away. However the majority of these clichés are played in a slightly different way which does not make them annoying to watch. The actors all do good jobs, I have not come across a character I've disliked yet, although no extremely lovable characters have yet, the closest being the original bodyguard. The script isn't as realistic as some other shows, it doesn't sound truly natural, but not to an annoying point. Also this version of Green Arrow is very much like Batman, no real wisecracks from our hero, just intimidation and darkness, although with the backstory given these would be somewhat out of place. The story is intriguing, and always keeps me interested, it really is a fantastic take on the Green Arrow story. Finally, what I adore about this show which puts it up to a 9, the action sequences are fantastic, when Arrow is Arrow something awesome always happens, and the costume is fantastic. The fight scenes are all very tense and I really enjoy watching them. I recommend this show as it is enjoyable and provides an interesting story. But not before you check out Breaking Bad, The Walking Dead and Game of Thrones, even if you are a DC comics fan like myself. ","8"
"Arrow",2014-03-06," The pure amount of progression with this show is incredible. Some shows have the first season be their best, not Arrow. Season 2 has been an INCREDIBLE ride with so many twists and turns while also pumping out great dialog and acting. How they have taken a character that I just tolerated from Smallville and completely dominated his presence in Arrow is a breath of fresh air. The flashbacks integrated within the main storyline is done so naturally that you don't care if half the episode is taking place in the past or not. Oliver Queen is a name you will not soon forget. If you are not watching this show, then you are SERIOUSLY missing out! ","10"
"Arrow",2014-03-05," Most overrated show I've seen, ever.I know that a lot of TV is awful, but gets swallowed up because people do not venture far from the mainstream, dumbed down, hypnotic crap which constantly flows through the screen like a sewage pipe. However, I did not know that the amount of people, who are this uncultured and blind to any critical thought was this huge.IMDb used to be (still is in many cases, it's a good site either way) a reliable source for figuring out whether a show/film was worth looking into, put seeing the high ratings of Arrow (which is 8.2 at the time of this being written) and the latest Hunger Games movie, I've lost hope.The spoiler free premise: Rich brat kid goes on a boat trip with his dad, he's got a coke problem and lacks moral and discipline.Boat sinks, everyone dies except him. He manages to maroon himself on an island, during this time he somehow manages to survive without any food nor drinking water (and probably with some bad coke withdrawal symptoms). He makes a bow out of what he can find on the island, gets really good at hunting animals and survives long enough for another ship to find him.Well, this doesn't seem too bad, leaving out some of the back-story and other revelations of course.But for some reason, he is now a parkour master, with martial arts skills, hacking skills (did he practice on a homemade computer he built out of wood and bear skin or something, maybe he powered it by putting a propeller in a tube and farting really hard to make a wind-turbine?).Now, what he should have done on that island, is trained on his damn acting. Because it blows. If I was an actor in LA trying to make a name for myself, I would of bought the box-set and hit myself in the head repeatedly until I died from head trauma.But if that isn't horrible enough, the entire cast share the most stale, unnatural, awful, awful acting abilities as the lead. It wouldn't have surprised me if the director got blown by every, single, member of the cast to be on this god forsaken show.It's just so sad to see resources which could have fed starving children go to waste on this melodrama of an  action-show . Too bad dramas require acting, which the cast does not suffice to provide. It should be called  bags of skin who might actually be robots reciting the terrible writing of a talentless person on camera held by another talentless person who somehow managed to get payed and recognized in a extremely tough business  instead of acting in this case.The style of this series is extremely similar to Smalville, with a lot of bright light and water drops in the eyes of the pretty female actresses to make them look better (which is the one thing they actually can do, for the most part), with the oily 80's pornflick filter and the half-arsed special effects. Though, Smallville actually being a half- decent show, gets a pass.There was one scene I laughed out loud at (it wasn't actually the scenes where the director/writer intended it to be funny, because those scenes were so try-hard funny that I literally cringed), it was a scene where Mr. Arrow shoots an arrow next to this generic  bad guy's  head, the  bad guy  says:  Hah, you missed!  whereas Mr. Arrow replies  I didn't LOL. .Apparently, he shot the the arrow (which actually had a flashdrive instead of a tip!) into the usb slot behind the  bad guy , which also contained a virus (which Mr. Arrow had taught himself to program on the island... or something?) which brought down the evil database, epic! Haha!Great writing indeed, no clichés included! I actually dislike this series so much, I feel good writing how awful it is, maybe I can discourage a single person to watch this lobotomy of a show and that would be enough to make me feel glad.TL;DR:Horrendous acting. Cliché-ridden, awful, hole-ridden, unoriginal and uninspiring writing. Horrendous acting. Overrated by people who would drink the kool-aid as long as the trailer had explosions in it. Directing and special effects on high school film project standards (that's actually insulting to high schoolers, since they actually have creativity, sorry). Acting, horrendous. Terrible makeup. Jokes and humour about as hilarious as reading obituaries.Acting; horrendous. ","1"
"Arrow",2014-03-05," Arrow is undoubtedly one of the best shows on television, and with an explosive ending to season one, a great build up tension in season two and being renewed for a third season, Arrow looks like it will become a regular show for the next couple of years. Like always, I'll keep this short (review for season one)*Acting: Above average *Pacing: Good *Dialogue: Good, at times above average *Action: Excellent *Drama: Good, at times above average *Story: GoodThe first season proved to be an entertaining, action packed thrill ride. With an eventful season two looming near its end and with season three in the works, Arrow will continually get better.Season One score: 7.7/10 ","7"
"Arrow",2014-03-05," Let's begin with the Arrow. Stephen Amell is very impressive in the fight scenes and the the scenes showing him training is just a slap in the face of most of us of the male gender. That being said...his acting is very wooden. He has three or four stances with which he delivers duologue and no facial expressions at all. Now...the show is still really entertaining. The plot and the action is as good as most action movies out there. The rest of the cast is OK but the characters are very one dimensional, maybe this is because of the source material or bad writing, i don't know, but it would be nice if the characters were more fleshed out.The origin story of Arrow and his escape from the prison island is actually the most entertaining. How he goes from spoiled rich kid to effective killing machine is handled very well in flashback, occasionally the episodes have to many back and forths from present to past and back again that the overall plot of the individual episode gets lost. Anyway...it's good entertainment...just don't expect Sorkin level of duologue. ","7"
"Arrow",2014-03-03," I remember first hearing about this show when I saw it on the cover of entertainment weekly about two years ago. It didn't look like anything special so I didn't even care to read the article. Now, I own a netflix account and after going through series after series, I ran out of things to watch. So, I saw Arrow and I thought,  Well it has good reviews and I've heard good things from critics and my friends so, why not?  BEST DECISION I EVER MADE. This show is down right fantastic. I consider myself a critic when it comes to entertainment, and so does everyone I know. I do this so much, that some people find me annoying. So trust me when I tell you, this show is great. The acting can be iffy at times, but what it lacks there it makes up for in the action, love story, non stop suspense, and the amazing plot. I was not a fan of the Green Arrow comics, but I can tell you I am now. And I have to say this interpretation on this show is one of the single most greatest things I've ever had the chance to watch (besides for Breaking Bad, of course). I'm on serious withdrawal from this show seeing as I just finished season one minutes ago on netflix and the first episodes from the second season (which I've heard is better than the first) are not on on demand. I am a huge fan of the comics of DC and video games, but I never really liked Green Arrow or even thought he was cool. After this, I can assure you I was so wrong. This show is a must see and if you think the beginning of the show is slow, I promise it gets better as it goes on. And apparently, the second season has developed into a actual good emmy award nominated show. Just look at the ratings compared from season one too now. I need more episodes so get on it Netflix because myself and many other fans cannot wait much longer. ","10"
"Arrow",2014-03-03," Initially, I had no expectations on the show whatsoever. After viewing the first episode I thought the show was satisfying, good action, good story, but unrealistic, and too much like Batman. By watching more and more episodes, it becomes clear why that is that oliver queen is that strong.*Do not base your rating on the first episode or the second, KEEP WATCHING* The show is absolutely great, amazing characters, loads of action, and awesome flashbacks on Oliver's years spent on the island (which are my favorite parts to be honest).Exceptional work from the cast of arrow, hope there will be lots of seasons!

"Arrow",2014-03-01," Being late (2014) to Arrow my interest was piqued by the mostly favorable blurbs on the usual internet haunts. Thus, I began with the first episode with high hopes. The idea of an everyman with near superman powers is immediately engaging. The back-story, overall, has promise if somewhat too sensationalized which is forgivable within the realm of comic book heroes come to life. That said, the high points would be the production values, the rich ambiance of the Starling City, the camera ready cast, and the idea of a Bruce Wayne young tycoon heir cum Arrow superhero. So, after only two installments I'm ready to criticize.There's a wooden quality to the story here as it unfolds. Too predictable and trite? Quite possibly. Does anyone have likable chemistry? The way the writers have immediately alienated the Queen family is trying as it should be all wrapped in the joy where a prodigal son, thought to be dead, is suddenly very much alive. The intricacies of the in-fighting begins at once. The fight against the cardboard cut-out villains plays out in fast-forward forcing that bit of realism a real life superhero needs to bounce off of. I've read it improves as the series progresses to which I hold out guarded hope. The idea is for a real-life Robin Hood with elevated heroes is certainly not the problem. The early realization of this veers too far in the less than believable realm however. A less antagonistic real fight for right is what is called for. Plus does anyone believe a hood with some black out around the eyes is unrecognizable? More realism with some believable justice served is the ticket. I'll update this when I get through the entire season if I find something more compelling to warrant it. ","6"
"Arrow",2014-02-28," DC comics are making their pattern such a stimulus act.They have originated a unique strategical HERO...what's the need to get another.I don't know.But it entertains.The 1st season was a twisty wreck. Twist and twists made that a sour candy.Ambylical choice for the viewers. It doesn't come out as a very high standard production.The action scenes were somehow boring. The old pathetic American killings won't take your breath away.But it's awesome make-dead-alive types of twists will punch u in your head.Though in some places it seems so horrible to get the dead ones alive.Sometimes dead ones should be dead,rather it would be a pessimist project and i think these twists will make your nerve cooler so you will not face any astonishing moments though the director would try his best to give you a feel of an unexpected element.The 2nd season is way too fluent than the 1st one.I don't know where the last destination is but hoping a decent finish than the 1st one.

"Arrow",2014-02-26," we like Arrow and we like everything about the show.. BUT! Katie/ Loral was very attractive the first season but now she has lost so much weight we cant stand looking at her, skin and bones.. not attractive anymore, hard too watch. Sorry, Eat some food girl way too skinny. As the show goes its one of our favorite shows on TV, thanks for such great entertainment. we need more and more super hero shows, miss smallville ha ha ha but Arrow has filled the void for now, keep up the good work and have a burger Katie. agents of shield is a great show also, hope Arrow stays around for a long time, and we hope Superman shows up in a episode soon, Cant wait for more and more episodes of Arrow to come. Thanks AL Garcia ","10"
"Arrow",2014-02-22," Initially after seeing the pilot I was a bit skeptical. The acting was sub par and to some extent I thought the special effects were slightly cheesy. Then I watched a few more episodes and boy was I hooked. This is an excellent take on the Green Arrow, a fresh perspective on a superhero with a penchant for violence which of course is absolutely necessary when dealing with deadly criminals. There is no room for compunction no room for morality like most superheros have. Absolute justice means taking lives and mercifully the creators of the show have taken creative license and bestowed the license to kill on their green arrow. And that is where the show triumphs. Also I quite liked the way the rest of the characters are been given screen time and are being allowed to develop. It isn't only about Oliver, the show is about the choices he makes and the way it effects people around him. On the whole I am quite happy with the direction the show is taking. Lets hope it stays this way. ","10"
"Arrow",2014-02-20," For all those bashing this show, they clearly don't understand what it is all about. First of all, People saying that it is a Nolan Ripoff just don't understand the character. Green Arrow in the comics, in his lore, is similar to Batman. They have similar back stories, are returning billionaires and share being  normal  human beings without superpowers. The show creators couldn't change that. Secondly, I do think this show started off a bit weak, with the Pilot moving too fast to get him into the hood and most of the cast a bit awkward with their roles, but as the first season progressed, it became increasingly good. They sorted out their pacing problems for the most part, and the characters by the end of the season had grown to be much more comfortable in their roles. They actually delivered powerful performances in the finale. Now, a LOT of people are unhappy with how this show fails at realism. To them I say, don't just see the first couple of episodes and judge. Yes, it does seem unlikely that Oliver Queen became a martial artist/expert archer/hacker/parkour expert by spending 5 years alone on an island. But the show does delve into his past a lot and gives reasonable explanations throughout. This is also my favorite part of the series, the flashbacks. These become increasingly interesting and mysterious and compliment the narrative wonderfully. On his 'mask' being ridiculous, it works for what they show. He is mostly in the shadows and/or hidden to be seen anyway and when he does fight, he moves fast enough to not be seen. Besides, they again have to stay true to the comic books and even so, all you can really see is his lower jaw, the same as Batman. Also, he still has more of a mask than Superman ever did. I also liked how the show used his bodyguard in the show. Diggle took up the mantle on a couple of occasions, giving Oliver the perfect alibi and completely disproving the assumption that he is the Arrow. This is something I have not seen any other superhero do really and I thought it was well done. The action in this show is also pretty good, considering it's a TV show. The one place it does fall through is the drama. It does get a bit excessive at times but one has to see that CW has to appeal to its main audience base; one that is used to the melodramatics. The actors, as previously stated, have really become comfortable with their characters. Stephen Amell in particular, has abandoned the slightly stoic persona and shows the naïve-ish Oliver queen versus the fright inducing vigilante quite well now. His portrayal of the old Oliver on the island and the contrast to the present Oliver is also well executed. Katie Cassidy does well in patches, she still does seem to be lacking but its not too bad. The rest of the cast is fine. People complaining about Thea have to understand that her character is supposed to be rebellious, considering what all she has gone through even if it is a cliché. One character I did not like was Helena. I feel like that was a casting error more than anything, but it was still disappointing. Overall, I think that this show is very good and it honestly surprised me a lot. It seems to be improving with every subsequent episode and I thoroughly recommend it. Please do not listen to the negative comments. ","8"
"Arrow",2014-02-20," Do not believe any of those negative reviews. I honestly cannot understand why some reviewers have given this such a low rating. I think some people love the sound of their own voice and think their opinion is worth something and will be disagreeable simply for the sake of it.Having said that, this show is stunning. I have never read the books and now I want to. There is so much crap on TV that is renewed year after year (CSI, House etc.) which uses cheap gags, pointless and sometimes ridiculous plots, unbelievable and many times one dimensional characters and yet all the truly great shows get cancelled.There is enough brain-dead television. But once in a while a show comes along that transports you to another world and makes you believe in the magic of television again. Arrow is one such show. ","10"
"Arrow",2014-02-17," Been following this show until about now and I simply have to let it go.When I started watching it I would have rated it like 6 for the action and the hot girls.But the story becomes unbarable stupid and combined with the none excisting acting - we are Down to 3 starts - I will then give it 4 stars because the girls are still hot.The story is going on in Present time in a city with flashback to an Island where our hero got his skills. Let me break it Down for you:The Island - For some reason our hero is on his fathers boat with his girlfriends sister, somewhere outside the coast of China. The boat is sabotaged by his fathers businessconnection/friend and everybody is lost - But our hero survives on an island - The Island is a vacation spot for soldiers and murderes - He became a martial Expert running around on a Island for 5 years, even that most of the time he is just running around scared. - There are some characters on the Island he bonds with.... but we don't really care - Suddenly his girlfriends sister appears.... she got saved by a ship with some genetic research project for make super soldiersThats about what I got out from all the annoying flashbacksIn the City the story is also ridicoules - He will avenge everything bad going on in the city - His father was one of the bad guy - His fathers business connection/friend is a super villain who survive a bazooka hit or something like that - His now X girlfriend is superhot, and she forgives our hero for sleeping with his sister and that she died ( at this point we don't know the sister survived) - The sister appears and she is also a super vigillante - Our hero have a mother, she can act but the talent is wasted on this TV show - Our hero has a sister which is cute but anoiying - The super villains son is our heroes best friend.... and he dies - Our hero has 2 Sidekicks - one superhot IT girl and a cool x-army dude or something... these 2 characters are about the only ones interesting in all this Did I forget something???? - OUR HERO CANT ACT....... Bye Bye Arrow had to let you go after 11½ episodes in season2 lives to short for crap ","4"
"Arrow",2014-02-13," If you liked Beverly Hills 90210, or Melrose Place, or Twilight, you will like this. Its basically a soap opera with a small super hero element thrown in. All the cast are beautiful, young actors who would be right at home on either one of those two shows. There's very little redeeming here--the actors give wooden performances all around as if they are just going through the motions. And for a guy who is supposed to be dark and angst ridden, the main character sure does have a big smile on his face all the time. He also looks like he just stepped out of GQ magazine. I don't know if its bad direction or what, but it is totally unconvincing that the main character has had these recent experiences.Its really just a waste of time. The vigilante super hero thing has been done to death anyway, but this really is just bad TV. No originality..I was bored to death. Avoid at all costs. ","1"
"Arrow",2014-02-09," I started watching this show when it started and I didn't known if it was going to go well. I continued to think  Eh, it's alright.  Until the end of the first season. When the story truly took off with the greatest bit of super villain acting that i have not seen in a long time. True there are many a great dc and marvel movies, but when I watched the episode  sacrifice  on arrow. I truly felt a real unveiling of a super villain. Then the second season began and i saw that this show can really become something great. If they start making super powers and even more out of this world elements. It may work. I hope more watch this show and see if it lives up to my praise. ","8"
"Arrow",2014-02-04," If you have followed some of the DC story lines and are familiar with their assortment of characters (not the big guns), you are in for a treat. Especially in Season 2. This is not a super-high production value movie like Marvel comes out once in a year. This is a TV show that lets you in on some of the stories of a multitude of characters in the DC universe... and I definitely find season 2 interesting.There is even Flash, Leagues of Assassins of Ra's Al Ghul, Solomon Grundy, China White, Deadshot, Deathstroke...and not to mention Green Arrow's girl in DC..the Black Canary.There are some soap-ish drama involved that sets you off track from the action...but thankfully this is not excessive. Recaps of how Queen became Arrow sparsed in between every episode is short and kept at a minimal but interesting pace. And true to the DC universe... people seldom die. It is a good time pass. Not a serious, gripping whodunnit or drama...but has its own genre of fun. Hopefully DC is building up for a JLA movie soon ","9"
"Arrow",2014-02-02," Since the pilot, Arrow's been a good show, and very popular. Having seen every episode, I thought the first two seasons were strong, though the Mirakuru element made me nervous. Now that we're approaching the third season's finale, I'm nervous again, but that's because the producers have said they're changing the elements of the show to more or less be in line with The Flash.A side note: if Arrow is the brooding older brother, The Flash is its energetic, lighthearted younger brother, with lots of go (pun intended).Back to Arrow. Can't say I like the Felicity/Ray pairing very much, especially when Ray is maligning Oliver. He has no idea what Oliver went through! However, I'm sure the writers will steer Felcity back towards Oliver eventually (fingers crossed!) ","10"
"Arrow",2014-01-22," This show does an amazing job of taking what you think is going to happen then completely flipping on a dime and saying  how you like that . I think the cast fits perfect and the story lines keep getting deeper and deeper. As a person who wasn't a big episodic show person, Arrow is the reason that I run the risk of a speeding ticket every Wednesday after work.I personally was a pretty big smallville fan and have always been a sucker for comic book based shows/movies. When I heard about arrow I was really really worried they were just gonna put the smallville green arrow in there from where smallville left off thank god they didn't. This show is dark it's action packed and it has very very beautiful women. I love this show and don't intend to change my mind about it. ","10"
"Arrow",2014-01-21," I have actually watched just about all of the show that has been released. I am not writing my review after watching ten minutes of the pilot and deciding it's crap. I really kind of liked the idea behind this show. I heard some people complaining about the lack of realism, but come on, it's a superhero show, a little unrealism ought to be allowed. Upon watching the first few episodes, I kinda hoped that like lot's of great television shows, the actors and writers just needed a bit of time to get into their groove really find their characters. Once that occurred I reasoned, the quality of the show would start to pick up. So despite my initial reservations I kept watching and waiting... and waiting... and waiting. It just never happened. The plot has remained unimaginative, static, and predictable; the actors are wooden and unsympathetic, and the writing is overall just a train wreck. I could honestly predict exactly what the actors were going to say next. It pains me to see this truly mediocre-at-best show get the rating it has received. I will attribute this injustice to the fact that the actors are incredibly pretty and the assumption that those giving this show a good rating would have their brains explode upon watching some quality programming. ","2"
"Arrow",2014-01-21," I had no interest in watching the show when i first heard about it. But many of my friends were highly recommending it, since I've been a DC fan since childhood so i thought id give it a try.I got hooked to it as soon as i finished the first episode and i watched 9 more episodes after that. The best thing about the show is that it doesn't only show oliver's present days but also the 5 years he spent on the island. we get to see what changed the billionaire playboy brat into a crime fighting vigilante. The story keeps you wanting for more no matter what. The fighting scenes keep getting better and better in every episode, the only way it can be described as is EPIC. It kills me to wait a whole week before i watch another episode of such an excellently written, directed, and acted show ","10"
"Arrow",2014-01-15," This is one of those shows that took a moment to find its way. The show was iffy in the beginning, obviously knew it was going to be a darker more mature tone than smallville but a bit awkwardly written, and it shows in the opening title.  my name is oliver queen. now i must save my city  people just don't speak like that. I'm also kind of mind blown as to how the CW thinks people treat billionaires, in real life there would be more people trying to ask him for handouts. Also, Olivers younger sister needs to polish her acting chops, maybe brush up her Adler method. By now, they've ironed out most of the kinks, namely the cheesy CW'esque predictable dialog. Anyway by season 2 most of the cast has it down and its getting exciting as they start throwing superpowers into the mix so oliver ends up more than just jason bourne with arrows. I'm at the edge of my seat for Ra's Al Ghul, who has been teased throughout the last 2 seasons and there's a lot of suspense with what they've shown you that they haven't shown you from on the island, particularly whether the entire 5 years were spent inside and what the assassins had to do with it. With the undertaking over, the eyes are on Moira to see what part she will play in the fallout of her actions. And blood... well i think he and the count have some catching up to do.Overall this show has just gotten progressively better every episode so i've got high hopes for it the next few seasons. If it keeps on continuing like this, it may just end up in my top 10. It was a much better show than Revolution which came out at the same time, which i had higher hopes for. So far it is also a much better move for the CW than acquiring the tomorrow people, which has still not ironed out its cheesy CW-ness. Even with superpowers like telekinesis and teleportation, its not as cool as arrow because of the shallow repetitive dialog and idealized characters.UPDATE: Late season two, i can officially say this show is a keeper. Deathstroke is absolutely the best villain yet, and while this show isn't my first priority television wise, its definitely got me interested in whats going to happen next. They've polished out the kinks and got a well rounded storyline, and the tension between the characters is at an all time high. I would say the production crew and writing staff has learned a few things along the way and gone from an awkwardly timed generic action show to making some of the most surprising, emotionally intense scenes i've seen on television. The stakes just keep getting higher, the odds keep getting slimmer, and Deathstroke even more powerful, its really coming into its own. It started as a show that was maybe a 7 or 8 but has progressively gotten better building to an absolutely fantastic second season. This is without a doubt the most improved show this year and they've come a long way since the pilot. ","10"
"Arrow",2014-01-13," Stephen Amell is a wonderful actor for Green Arrow! I love the DC references, (Spoiler Alert) and now that Sarah is Black Canary and Slade having super-human powers, and maybe Roy too. Overall the show is great. Thea's character is good too, I like her development throughout the show, as well as Moira and Malcolm. The only flaw in the show is Tommy's death, I feel like it should have been written a tad bit better, and I also think it should have affected Laurel more. I really like what they are doing with Barry also, the actor for him is great, and I LOVED the scene where he became the Flash and how they foreshadowed it throughout season 2. I can't wait for Brother Blood and Ra's Al Ghul to join the show more and I loved the Soloman Grundy reference with Diggle. ","10"
"Arrow",2014-01-13," From a critical standpoint, I shouldn't like this show. The acting isn't that good, some of the premises are outlandish even for a superhero series (which is really saying something). Even worse, the number of unnecessary plot twists is really starting to get to me. Plot twists are good in moderation, but after a while they get tiresome. Plot wise, the first season was good. As someone who knows the Green Arrow comic story, the spin on it was pretty good for the first season, flashbacks especially. However, I'm not a fan of the whole Flash thing, my rating might drop with the next few episodes...Yet somehow I still enjoy watching it. Maybe it's the writing, which while streaky, is good for some episodes. Maybe it's the weird abundance of plot twists, I like a few of them. I'm not sure. ","7"
"Arrow",2014-01-07," I have been a member of IMDb for over four years and have never commented on anything. Tonight is my first trajectory into cyber-hatchetry.The Arrow is, unequivocally, better than the Game of Thrones, for example. I do, however, wish the show was on a different and less embarrassing network. Alas....What I distinctly enjoy about the show is Stephen Amell. He is quiet and brooding as Oliver Queen within the Queen dominion, diabolical and anti-social as the vigilante/Hood, and nerdy, vulnerable and emotionally unpredictable on the island. This triptych of breadth is hard to pull off and Stephen is aces at it. Love him, so I won't spend any time debating him. Frankly, he is basically beyond comment.Meryl Streep once explained that you can have breadth or depth as an actor, or both. Let's hope the writers let Stephen go deep in Season 3.What I want to get at is the labyrinth of supporting characters in the DC universe. And, for anybody who hasn't seen the series, everybody else is subservient to Oliver's character, whether they communicate this reality on-screen or not. This show is character-driven. And, importantly, there's lots of excellent fighting (especially between Oliver and the Rasmussen assassin at the end of DVD 4 and in Episode 5 of Season 2).Susanna Thompson grounds the show. She is superlative as Moira. Hard but vulnerable, which is a tough line to endure and deliver. Thea, OK, but she could go either way. Colton What's-his-name, give me a break. Kill him off please. Katie Cassidy....love her. She has the right level of beauty and emotional gravitas to make her role fly. And, she tears up easily. Emphatically, I can see a guy like Oliver jumping buildings to impress her. The best friend, the Merlyn son, wow....I am so glad he died in the first season. If he is reincarnated on the show like his Dad, I might be forced to stop watching. China White....fantastic. Sad to see her tied up in Season 2. Black Canary...decent....she could go either way like Thea. Her voice has a tremulous quality that really imparts empathy. Depends on the writing, I suppose. She is a decent fighter, and that helps. The Daddy Merlyn, am seriously angry that he's back. I never got beyond his fake orthodontic work. Kill him again please. Oh, and Felicity. She has promise. She's like Thea, and can go either way. Diggle, of course, is the gold standard for supporting characters. I look forward to seeing his relationship with Oliver get more nuanced. And, finally, the latest addition....the nerdy CSI guy. He's got promise.As long as Laurel and Oliver end up together in the end, and Oliver starts actively serving humanity in a more selfless manner, then this will be the tale that I signed up for. Despite any reservations about annoying characters that I shared, I simply can't recommend this series enough. The music, the fighting, the art direction.....simply everything is top drawer. ","10"

"Arrow",2013-12-23," Right from the pilot episode, the series has captivated me well enough to prevent me from missing any of its episodes. Its got a great storyline, a lot of action stunts, superheroes, family drama, love trysts and its enigmatic tales. Its a story of a playboy, Oliver Queen, who was presumed dead, returns after five years from a deserted island to avenge his father's death and save his city from its tainted citizens. The flashbacks that display Oliver's period in the island are enthralling and the challenges that he had to face in order to survive there, shaped him to be the present day vigilante who is not afraid to face any authority. Its one of my current favorite TV shows and you've got to get yourself hooked on to it....:) ","10"
"Arrow",2013-12-22," First I was really thrilled and excited about the idea of a show, which is based on a graphic novel and refreshes the classic  hero-against-the-villains-theme , even if I haven't heard much about this Green Arrow guy before. Than I saw this piece of something...Should I be offended by the more than perky patchwork of all the mainstream concepts, which are commonly associated with rating success? Should I blame the  writers  for stealing or  borrowing  conceptual ideas almost everywhere? Take the Batman motive, put it in the Nikita framework, add some O.C. Jibberjabber, shake it, put some great cherries from Lost on the top and voila - there is our new hit guarantee. Hell yeah, since we have some really huge and almost unbearably exciting  mysteries  about the background stories of the characters, why not shoot some scenes on a mystery island anyways. As there is no need to cover the  transfer of ideas , we might as well hammer it into the viewers head: This show is so cool and so hip, like all the Batman movies combined, but newer, AND it has Lost in it!Should I blame the producers for casting only model like hobby actors? Should I be irritated by frequently showing the topless Adonis, who is supposed to be the Green Arrow, while he is working out? Or should I wonder why fathers look the same age as their sons, of course extremely handsome and  ageless young ?I could go on like this for hours. Well, not for hours, as there isn't very much more to say about this show. Fact is, none of this really bothers me, I've seen it and learned to deal with it, as long as a show delivers what I asked for: Some respectable action and good entertainment. But this piece of something manages to ruin even that. There always have to be some pseudo-dramatic scenes, these more than poorly written and played soap elements finally stabbed me in the guts and took me down. I have to surrender: Please, no more arrows! Why do I have to live in a world where Firefly was canceled and Arrow will probably run for decades?The three stars are only for costumes, some pretty sweet combat scenes and Manu Bennett (who played Crixus in Spartacus, I just like this guy).

"Arrow",2013-12-14," When I first started to watch this series, I thought I would watch maybe one or two episodes. Never been more wrong. I saw the first Season in a rush. After the end of Season one, in which Oliver Queen couldn't save the whole Starlight city, he finds himself on the island he was trapped again, to recover from all the difficulties , that have happened. I think the second season will be even better, the rivals are getting more equal and the whole story is less predictable than the first one. Also that with almost every episode you learn, that his lonely island was actually everything else than lonely... I like the flashbacks more and more, as they reveal the reasons and the process of Oliver which show, why he became the man he is now. ","9"
"Arrow",2013-12-12," Always being a big fan of Smallville, Arrow had been on my list for quite some time. Thankfully, Netflix added the first season and I was able to consume it in a little under a week, something I haven't done since I watched Dexter for the first time. The last episodes of the first season and all of the 2nd season have been some of the best television this past year, second only to Breaking Bad, IMO. Any prior fans of Smallville will love Arrow. It's made by the same team and the production value has increased dramatically since then. I couldn't help to compare it to Lost or Batman Begins in some regard, which are great shows to emulate. Also a lot of great cameos from actors known for their roles in other sci-fi shows, a feature of Smallville I enjoyed thoroughly. ","10"
"Arrow",2013-12-08," After seeing the 8.1 score and reading some reviews I was expecting much more from this series. It is what I would imagine 'Days of Our Lives' would be like - with arrows. The acting is wooden at best and I am struggling to understand how, alone on an island for 5 years, someone could become an expert fighter? This would seem to be th product of the daytime soapie factory attempting to venture into the 'action' sector. It is nowhere near the quality that it needs to be to even spark any interest on my part, much less to have me awaiting the next episode with anything but dread.

"Arrow",2013-12-05," I must admit, I did not know where this show was going in the beginning. Now I have to say, this show has become one of my favorites. I really hope we can get at least 6 seasons or more out of this one. Probably the best show aired on the CW. I don't get to watch a lot of TV at the time that it is broadcast. I mainly download episodes from torrent sites. So I really hope that torrent downloads add to the ratings. Great acting, interesting characters, action packed, and Felicity Smoak is SUPER HOT. Other reviews that I have read seem to reflect the same views that I had before giving it a chance to develop. TB ","9"
"Arrow",2013-11-08," Let's take a moment of mourning for the TV plot arcs of yore. Back when shows prioritized the characterizations above the action and, if indeed there was action, it took place precisely in the last 7 minutes of the episode, and was all done with before the close, giving the characters a chance to make light comic banter, close down the storyline, and give the audience a chance to go to the toilet. How many TV shows followed that formula I cannot say, but the number was in the 100s. Now all that has changed. You can now have action many times in the body of a show, it is permitted, even encouraged. And you have action even before the characterizations are fully developed. All this is positive evolution I think. But here the catch. There are no more  closed  story-lines. In the multi-band, multi-channel, multi-device electronic age, where viewers tend to have attention span of a hummingbird, nighttime TV has astonishingly borrowed the Rule Book of daytime soap operas and, lo!, plots never actually resolve, they just become more complex. ARROW is one of the best exponents of the new type of comic-book-derived drama, arguably as good as or even better than SMALLVILLE (which was, thematically, all over the map). Amell is great. He has a whispery kind of delivery which oddly makes what he says that much more interesting. The supporting cast is great. In fact the only thing that prevented me from giving this a  10  are the flashbacks. They are terrible. They are like some silent Hell the viewers must go through to get back to the actual episodes. It is almost as if the lead writer, as a small child, was locked in a closet with a DVD looping KUNG FU, and grew up to believe that you cannot advance 10 minutes of plot in the present, without 2 minutes of flashback to fortify it. ","8"
"Arrow",2013-11-08," This amazing television show brings everything a fan and viewer could possibly want. Every episode has left me on the edge of my seat desperate for more. Stephen Amell brings Oliver Queen to life in a hard gritty fashion. Every week I try to anticipate what will happen next, with little to no success. From the first tier stunt work, to the amazing characters. The actors and settings, I personally cannot praise Arrow enough. If you haven t had the opportunity to catch Arrow yet, make the time. You will not regret it. Currently as Season two rolls on in spectacular fashion I am left with a hunger for more. And Arrow delivers, more heroes, more villains and action that if this writer had hair it would be raising. Keep up the good work. ","9"
"Arrow",2013-11-06," Even though I absolutely love this show, Stephen Amell is a great choice for Oliver, I think it is very reminiscent of Batman. I do not like how Oliver is portrayed as a man whose womanizing is all fake, that he just does it to separate himself from The Hood/Arrow. I liked Hartley's version(Smallville) where his ladies-man attitude wasn't an act, it was apart of him. I think that being on an Island for 5 years he would want to forget about the experience, and get back to normal life, how he can't just do that, and he doesn't just lie or put up an act, he just becomes 2 separate people. While this is a good show on it's own; I can't wait for a film adaptation where this oversight is changed. ","10"
"Arrow",2013-10-27," Superhero movies are incredibly tough to make: balancing the plot, trying to make the storyline believable, all while adding well done fight scenes. This film does it beautifully. One of the very few to do it too. I can't say that other than The Dark Knight trilogy, I can't think of one superhero movie/TV program that does  superheroes  well. I thought this show was exciting and completely understood how to make a superhero real. Every part of every character was enough to make me shed a tear at the first season finale. Completely worth watching and will have you begging to watch just one more.I find it hard to get too into shows that don't tell you everything at first because the show tends to draw secrets out way too long. There wasn't much of that here. I felt almost satisfied with every episode. However there were some cliffhangers to leave me on the edge of my seat.If you are a fan of superheroes AT ALL, watch this series. I guarantee it will not disappoint. ","10"
"Arrow",2013-10-25," I'm personally huge fan of superheroes, esp Batman, Spiderman. Arrow takes a lot from both the superheroes I love. Stephen Amel's physic , agility & training makes the Green Arrow more believable than any other superhero.. By far he is the best fit to portray a superhero!!!Although the show has loopholes I'm fine with it!!! Mystery - Check; Cool tech - Check ; Double life - Check Romance - Check Action - Check; Thrill - Check ; Storyline - Needs more effort from the script writers; Depth of character - A lot to be desired!!On the whole the show is brilliant. Laurel is a beauty. Felicity & Dig are awesome. Looking forward for some more interesting plots.. ","8"
"Arrow",2013-10-24," After reading that this series was  trying to be gritty and dark like the Nolanverse Batman , based on my contempt for the Dark Knight Rises and gradual decreasing opinion of Dark Knight I decided to avoid this show completely.... How wrong was I?I suppose the fact I have never read a Green Arrow comic may have helped. I always viewed the character as a very camp, poor man's Batman when he or Arsenal (who I did like) crossed paths with any of the Bat- family. This however is a slightly more dark and sinister Green Arrow who doesn't have a problem with killing people. There are elements which feel very similar to Batman Begins and since the first season is his first year as  the Hood  I think it was unavoidable since both character's have similar back stories. The pacing of the episodes is good, I got sucked into the story enough that I didn't spend half my time looking for flaws. The action/fight sequences are fast and well choreographed except for the pilot episode where you feel like he's an 80's action hero, (seriously, out in the open, surrounded by guys with automatic weapons, and none of them could hit the side of a Battleship if they tried? Come on!).As with all series there will be some rubbish episodes and bad casting choices, basically the ones with Helena Bertinelli aka. the Huntress were particularly poor and the choice in actress, well she just isn't sexy enough or athletic enough for the role so I just hope she doesn't come back.It does not take itself too seriously and there are some humorous moments including a few DC in-jokes. It isn't perfect yet but it has the potential to be as long as it doesn't follow Smallville's strategy of - lets build the series to an ominous finale aaaand then give the fans a steaming pile of crap.Finally I state this for all the 1 star reviewers who are clearly Nolan fan-boys (you watch the pilot and think you can have a valid opinion on an entire series? Suuuure!). This is not a pretentious, pseudo-philosophical artsy show, it is entertainment pure and simple. So if you think DKR is the best film of all time just don't bother watching this show, you will find every reason to hate it, so just pop in your worn out DVD and watch it for the 400th time the rest of us don't really care what you think! ","8"
"Arrow",2013-10-24," When I first heard about the show in 2012 I honestly didn't have high hopes.But I'm impressed. Really. Amazing show, entertaining as hell. Takes a new spin on the superhero format, beautifully written. It has its faults, some things could be improved on, some things are a bit cliché, but all in all this show is GREAT and delivers everything that it's supposed to.You also get hooked to the alternative storyline revealing Oliver's time on the island and everything that built up to becoming the Arrow.In the end of the day I love it. ","10"
"Arrow",2013-10-19," I'm an older person so watching movies or TV series originating from comic books isn't high on my list, but recently many that have been made for theaters and TV screens have been wonderful. At the top of a list is  Arrow.  I fell in love with this show from the beginning and I think a lot of it has to do with the choices in casting. All of the cast has done a superb job with their characters. I don't know why anyone would accuse the actors who portray Oliver and Laurel to be wooden. This story has changed over time. I took the time to look up the back history of the Green Arrow and all of its incarnations. They took all of that and made it better as a TV series. I absolutely love Amell in the part of Arrow. He does a great job and I can find no fault in his acting whatsoever. He portrays his character at different time periods and personas and does a wonderful job. I have seen hundreds of movies and TV series in my life time and I have to say this one is awesome. It's great for females and males. It has dynamic female characters and male. It isn't like any other show I have watched and I have seen many and it isn't copying anyone else because the story of the Arrow is actually quite old. If you like high energy action with a little romance thrown in but not overdone then this is the show for you and especially if you are a comic book fan. The special affects are very good for TV. I plan on watching it every week and hope it stays on the air for many more seasons. I didn't give a synopsis since there are many here already. ","10"
"Arrow",2013-10-17," This is all-too typical fare. I know next to nothing about the comic book and these actors ~ all of them ~ are meaningless faces that take on no real meaning. Unless you like action sequences, I wouldn't bother. Or I'd go watch reality TV like the UFC if that's your thing.I'm not sure if it's worth it to describe the dimensions, shape, colour, and texture of garbage because, for me, it matters very little. I see this has gotten a user rating of 8.1. I'm 32 minutes into the first episode, and a most important moment, where he tells Laurel Lance he's going to hurt her again, falls flat. I've seen better acting sequences on The Smurfs and greater sexual tension on The Muppet Show, and in this case, I'm talking between Gonzo and Fozzie Bear.  Arrow  was dreaming in Technicolor if it was going for the authenticity of Miss Piggy and Kermit the Frog.That crap about his sister going five years without her brother and turning into a drug addict? Crap. I don't know whether to blame the acting or the shitty direction on this one. What difference does it make? The point is no-one's really trying. Arrow  is green, narrow in scope, off-target, and hopelessly unoriginal. So... now that I think of it, you're better off with garbage: At least with the discarded scraps you get authenticity.  Arrow  is so pre-processed, it's a worthless sawdust, or worthless until it's used to fill the spaces of the shoddiest particle-wood entertainment-centre-in-a-box. ","5"
"Arrow",2013-10-13," Been watching Arrow since it was first released. Didn't know what to expect as never read any of the comic books but did know the Green Arrow. After seeing the trailer I thought this looks good so gave it a go. All I can say it  WOW . Great character development, good acting, great fighting choreography and Stephen Amell plays Oliver McQueen really well and portrays him as a vigilante. I know understand more about the Arrow universe and like the fact that there are flash backs to the Island which let us as the viewer know how Oliver become who he is after returning back to Starling City after 5 years of everyone presuming he was dead Am hooked on Arrow now and glad that season 2 is now underway. ","10"
"Arrow",2013-10-09," Following up in the footsteps of  Smallville,  this introduces viewers to another DC character. However, Green Arrow has a much darker outlook on crime fighting and a shadier past than the Man of Steel.Arrogant billionaire playboy Oliver Queen accompanies his father on a boating trip aboard their luxury yacht. After the ship sinks and everyone on board dies, he's left to fend for himself for five years on a remote island. While there, he encounters a deadly band of mercenaries setting up for an attack. He partners up with another castaway who teaches him the art of war with a bow and arrow. Upon his rescue, Oliver returns to his home with a renewed passion in life. He will rid the city of its criminal elements using his newfound skills as a vigilante archer.If you're expecting  Smallville  going into  Arrow,  you need to get that out of your head right now. It's much darker and rooted in realism. Where Clark Kent had issues with offing villains, Green Arrow doesn't think twice. He's closer to Batman than Superman in attitude, although the Dark Knight doesn't believe in killing either. That's probably why they decided to re-cast the lead character and steer as far away from the Oliver Queen and hero we saw in the sci-fi and fantasy-heavy  Smallville. You won't find any meteor freaks or meta-humans in  Arrow,  either. The villains and other heroes Arrow runs into are all rooted in reality. Think Christopher Nolan's  The Dark Knight  Trilogy versus Zack Snyder's  Man of Steel.  Arrow  takes some time building up, but the wait pays off. It's a slow- burning drama with characters the writers flesh out enough that you actually care about them. Some of those characters will be familiar to viewers who follow the comic book. We get appearances by the Huntress, Deadshot, Deathstroke, Roy rperHHarper and Laurel Lance. To comic book geeks, it's common knowledge that Harper becomes Speedy/Red Arrow/Arsenal and Lance takes on the alter ego known as Black Canary. It's treats like these that give hardcore fans a lot to smile about.  Arrow: The Complete First Season  is not rated. I would give it a PG-13 rating because of adult situations, violence, and language. It's a prime-time TV show on a major network, but it still dives into a some mature content children don't need to see.  Arrow isn't only for comic book fans. The writers for the show do a great job establishing characters and a universe that anyone can enjoy. It's a slow-burning drama with enough action, mystery, and suspense to keep audiences coming back for more. Although it gets off to a slow start because of character development,  Arrow  successfully picks up and ultimately pays off with a great second and third act. ","8"
"Arrow",2013-10-07," Borrowing heavily from Christopher Nolan's  Dark knight  trilogy, and  Batman Begins  in particular, adding in a cast of uniquely annoying Americans, a load of flashbacks, and a highly improbable character, who the writers are even afraid to refer to by name,  Arrow , to me, is quite simply magic, in the truest sense of the world. Because, for some unknown reason, it's an incredibly good series, with a finale which left me gaping. Not even  Fringe  could do that.So, what's the secret of the green guy with the bow then? How do soap-opera heavy story lines of bickering families full of people with massive egoes, and very little acting talent, with the thinnest scraping of urban street fighting, make for such an enjoyable run of episodes?First off, the first three episodes are quite frankly terrible, and nearly destroy the entire concept. But, persevere, and you will be richly rewarded. From episode 4, things pick up considerably, until they reach a climax of perfection with The Huntress' two parter - episodes 7-8, and episodes 9 and 10 are consistently good. Then, the whole thing sort of goes off track again, with complication upon un-necessary complication, and the Robert Queen journal is put into mothball, as Oliver kind of forgets what he's supposed to be up to, and fights random, usually quite annoying criminals, like The Count, the absolute nadir of the show. The two part finale, whilst literally ripping off the exact plot of  Batman Begins , is suitably epic in scale, and delivers shock upon shock, and made me realise that I'd enjoyed this show more than any Marvel film. This, is the way forward, one of the few Nolan clones, which works.As for the cast, Stephen Amell is someone you will grow to like, as he gets more comfortable in the role (He's definitely rather weak to start off with, in those crucial first three episodes), but most importantly, whilst not being a brilliant actor, he is a likable enough personality. The star of the show, in terms of acting, is David Ramsey, playing a half Dr Watson, half Alfred to Amell's vigilante. Ramsey is charismatic, and totally at ease in his role, easily the best actor in the show. Katie Cassidy playing Dinah Laurell Lance, is annoying, and prone to bouts of whinging, which get on your nerves, as does Willa Holland, Queen's younger sister, who at times, is the most annoying person in the show, hands down. Colin Donnell, playing Tommy Merlyn, Queen's best buddy, is another talentless effort, who stumbles through his lines like a robot. Susanna Thompson - pretty much the same, but less annoying. Paul Blackthorne, playing the unwashed police father to Laurell Lance, constantly poses, and doesn't have a genuine bone in his body. Cotton Haynes, as a juvenile delinquent version of Roy Harper, the same. Emily Bett Rickards, as convenient plot gap filler, Felicity Smoak, a computer nerd, is again all show, but mildly charming in a deeply irritating fashion.The guest cast, thankfully, is better - John Barrowman is an excellent corporate main villain, and even Alex (River Song) Kingston shows up as Laurell's mother. For comic fans, you'll get the pleasure of seeing a brilliant rendition of Deathstroke, a less brilliant Deadshot, a pretty cool, but totally changed Royal Flush Gang, and Kelly Hu's China White. But as I said, the highlight is most definitely the Huntress - played with style and panache by Jessica De Gouw.The series makes extensive use of flashbacks to Oliver's island ordeal, and a rather implausible storyline about hired mercenaries, in which Olly's going to learn to do his thing. More training, and less killing tons of guys in black balaclavas would be nice, but who can argue with Deathstroke, the most awesome thing in the whole show? Shame he's killed half way through. For series 2, I'd like more ideology, and symbolism in the island stuff, counteracting the action in the main narrative.The story lines are generally very character driven, with around five minutes of arrow packing action an episode on average. Not much, but generally worth waiting for, because the fight scenes are well worked out, and generally exciting, in spite of their Dark Knight style editing. Acrobatics and parcourt are used extensively, to give a functional feel to Oliver's combat system.The characterisation tends to suggest that all these characters are very narrow minded, as they continually over-react to the smallest things. A lot of ego-trips, posing about, and people coming out with things like  Stop Judging Me! , and  I'm not who you think I am , and  Why did you lie to me? , as well as just about the entire cast at some point telling Oliver that they wished he'd died on the island (including Olly himself in the last episode.) All rather tiresome, but there's some nice ideology in there too, as well as perhaps the closest match to an actual comic book feel I've ever seen for any superhero adaptation,with tons of dilemmas, and secret identity crises. To be honest, it feels a lot like seventies and eighties Spider Man comics. Not bad at all. So, overall, it's definitely a grower. Maybe they never call him Green Arrow - instead opting for the likes of  Hood Guy  (Yeah, THAT sounds cooler...), but it's an earnest, and enjoyable show, even if it does fluctuate rather in terms of quality. Put it like this, I'm looking forwards to Season 2 considerably, and, whiny soap opera or not, it's got a lot more character in it than Marvel movies. Hopefully, Arrow will be the way forwards, carrying the Nolan torch into a dark urban world, and giving us a ray of hope. A work of art? No. Entertaining? Undoubtedly. ","8"
"Arrow",2013-10-02," I just finished watching season one and I'm looking forward to the start of season two. I think this show gets better as it goes. At first, it was hard to get into because it seemed overly dramatic and kind of soap opera-ish. The characters were rather hard to believe, but I liked the story so I stuck around. As time goes by, it's easier to buy into the characters. Some of the acting is lacking, but that also seems to get better with time. There are a couple things that are very predictable, and I found the back and forth with Laurel a bit obnoxious. There are times that call for a certain amount of suspension of belief, but it's a show about a superhero so it's hard to complain about that.Overall, I find some things about this show annoying, but I still want to know what happens next.

"Arrow",2013-09-30," Well sorry for giving u 9 , I mean the episodes are awesome, story is awesome , characters but u lack with some characters u know ... DC Comic G and the gang ..... OK that is essentially why i gave u 9 ..... Accept for Roy Harper that i hope will be one of the main characters in new seasons ........Well to summer my review u need to get other characters from DC Comics that where in it with Green Arrow that is all ..... So , all the other Super Heroes will be shown i new seasons , as well as Super Villains in some episodes of new season ....... Thank u for Screening The Arrow and hopefully i will see the new seasons soon :) ","9"
"Arrow",2013-09-23," There's not just a single season for why this series could have a higher than 4 over 10 rating, well perhaps the only 1 reason could be that u just never saw a really good series.Starting with the story and plot that develops so predictable and immature, without any real drama or suspense, and a regular to fake action sequences. The script is full of clichés & weak lines that complement the bad acting from almost all the  actors  starting with the worst one: Stephen Amell the protagonist. If that's not enough, the FX, lighting, song choices, even the wardrobe and interiors design looks and hears cheap, without any kind of quality in the whole thing. ","3"
"Arrow",2013-09-22," As much as I can easily watch this, there are two things which stand out for me: Shameless product placement (we're looking at you Microsoft) and the unbelievable amount of makeup that the women on the show seem to be staggering around under. Makeup is something that I never really notice, but this is the first time I've ever leaned forward in my seat and gone  Holy cow, how long does does it take to do that?  Oh yeah, then there's the premise of the billionaire kid who become a martial arts superhero in only 5 years, the IT girl who can  hack  FBI encryption in two keystrokes and the mindless dialog... Yes it's a  superhero  series, but to me it just feels horribly awkward and clunky. Somehow though, it's still watchable... ","4"
"Arrow",2013-09-17," Just saw the first episode and after high expectations am somewhat disappointed.Good things up front: Stephen Amnell is a pleasure to look at and his costume really is one of the cooler ones in the superhero world (no pointy ears, no tights, no cape to get stuck with in a revolving door). And there is no awkward animal-reference in his hero-name! However, the story and the character seem kind of familiar. Young Millionaire comes home after having suffered. At home, he keeps playing the high society idiot, while in his secret fighter identity he tries to save  his city  from the bad guys with the help of his butler - sorry, driver. Oh, and his wannabe-girlfriend is a lawyer for the poor and helpless. Sounds familiar? You might say: Why not copying a good idea? OK - but this was not a good copy. In a series, you normally have more time to evolve a character, than in a 90-mins movie. However, this was just clad together without any love or effort. They gave Batman much more time in his movie to show his motivation, his background, to make the character 3D. My feeling in ARROW was:  you all know the general idea anyways, so let's tick of the main points so that we can get to the action.  If you like that - It's your show.Some more irritations: His father, after having been a  bad guy , turns around in a life-threatening situation (where normal people think about themselves, even more so a bad guy) and asks his son to set everything right - not really convincing. In Batman at least, Wayne tries to keep up the ideals of his father, which he grew up with - much more convincing.ARROW pushes away his girlfriend, just when she seemed to mellow towards him. In Spiderman, they took a whole movie to motivate this act. Here - nothing (ah, you know, that's just what superheros do, so swallow it!) The bad guys here are the  Money Makers . OK, after the financial crisis, that was to be expected at some point. However - as opponents for a super-hero? I mean - to defeat simple bad guys (like the Cat, the Penguin, Dr. Octopus) with simple kick-ass action, that is OK. Nothing against simple solutions - but then create bad guys where that fits. The worlds economic and finance system is just too complicated for an  I kill them and then their're gone  solution. So the ARROW certainly satisfies the desire for vengeance, but not the desire for a good story.Promising, however: the hint at the end, that his mother is up to something against him. Whether this motivates me enough to watch the second episode, I'm not sure yet. ","5"
"Arrow",2013-09-13," I wonder if people on here have actually seen anything past the 10th episode, because this thing got off to a rocky start. It stumbled, fell, and almost died on its way to the ER, but somewhere, the acting started coming together. After being squelched and tweaked, most of the cast departed from the soap opera plague that infested it, early on.Arrow borrows a little from Nolan, but does it well. Reminiscent of Bruce Wayne, Alfred Pennyworth, and Luscious Fox, Oliver provides raw emotion to the quest, Diggles his moral center, and Felicity, in a Freudian id, ego, superego tug-of-war, provides a pragmatic middle ground. Like the Dark Knight series, the name of the hero is very loosely associated with the depicted character.  Green Arrow  is actually called  lame  in the single time it was mentioned. A huge departure from the Nolanesque is the character's willingness to kill those that stand in his way. He racks up quite a tally, and isn't really sorry about it.The origin story is interspersed within the actual real-time story line, which reflects on the character. Oliver's transformation happens quickly in places, and shows that he is tougher than he appears, but the naivety on the island isn't as convincing as his hardened demeanor after his island trial-by-fire. That makes me believe that the island cut scenes were shot before the rest of the season, making it impossible for the cast to form the close working relationships that would naturally happen, later.Villains are not superhuman, and their place is more of a conspiracy, rather than a target of revenge (Diggle's brother, aside). Oliver's quest isn't about revenge, it's about going down a list, and checking names off as these names get offed. Some episodic deviations occur, and should be overlooked, as the overall story arc is actually pretty good.Playing Oliver Queen, Stephen Amell is physically devoted to the roll. More than just a few of the stunts look like they were done by him, and nobody should doubt his dedication to the physical prowess of his character. For all of its weaknesses, Arrow takes enough from Nolan to make itself a solid base, and makes for a good TV adaptation. I give it an 8/10, but a rock solid 8/10, with room to move up.Watch it through to the middle of the season, you might be surprised. ","8"
"Arrow",2013-09-07," I was never keen on the poster and the Green Arrow wasn't high in my hero list but I must admit I was gripped by this show with it's premise and it built up nicely with characters and plot revolving around a few central stories. It was nice to fresh faces in the cast and not full of plastic actors. There definitely was a good mix of twists and turns in the plot and I really like the flash backs. Each episode holds on it's own as well as revolving around a central theme. This paves the way for other hero shows and look forward to series two. I would like to see more of a cross over with other DC characters to open up new shows as well as pave a way for the justice league. ","9"
"Arrow",2013-08-04," I'm not a Green Arrow fan. I only know of him through the Justice League animated series and he'll occasionally appear in graphic novels such as the Dark Knight Returns Part 2, which is why I took an interest in this show.To be honest, I really feel like this show has MUCH more potential. G.A. was originally designed after Batman (millionaire, father dies, etc), but the structure feels more like Smallville but with a lesser known character. Rather than play on the witty gadgets that Green Arrow might use, the directors chose to play on focus on family drama, ie G.A. is the overprotective brother, mother is with another man, his best friend sleeps with his girlfriend, etc. I also wish the show wouldn't make Detective Lance look like a complete moron. It would've been great if the makers of the show provided more perspective into the lives of other lesser characters such as John Diggle, Thea, Laurel, etc. G.A. feels like a 2 dimensional character, yes he killed in the beginning, but after that he simply wants to bring justice to the city and every episode seems to end in the same way. There was hardly any villain that was equal to G.A.. Comparatively, Batman can be seen in many different angles. For instance, Batman could be seen as a man who NEEDS to be the caped crusader and subconsciously creates his own nemeses.Lastly, the dialogue was overly cliché, which made a lot of the characters seem 2 dimensional.***SPOILER***I know I said lastly, but they freakin' killed Deadshot. No freakin' wayyyyyy!!! ","6"
"Arrow",2013-08-01," The main actor is as wooden as they come and looks ridiculous in every scene. After the opening few seconds i knew it was going to be awful, I saw a bad explosion effect and a man wearing a silly looking hood and an obviously fake beard. In fact, everyone looks ridiculous with bad make up and lighting. The writing is painfully dull, any attempts at humor are mind bogglingly unfunny. The main character is highly unlikable and it is difficult to find anything with which to identify. The director seems to have done nothing but point the camera in the right direction as there is no flair or artistry evident. How does this have a high review I just can't understand it. ","1"
"Arrow",2013-07-28," Arrow is a very entertaining series. You'll find your self biting your nails occasionally. The starting is a quite blunt but it gets sharper as the plot moves forward. They also did a good job ending each episode with an exciting sequence which makes sure you watch the next episode.The biggest flaw is that it lacks originality.It seems clear that the whole theme is based on Christopher Nolan's Batman Franchise. There are several parts in the show where you feel resemblances to the three batman movies. I also expected similarities from  Cast Away  which I am glad wasn't there.Apart from these two movies several scenes remind you of epic scenes from various movies. Looking at the bright side those scenes are worth another watch and the crew has done justice to the original scenes.I believe its worth a watch if you are looking for entertainment, but chances are that you have already heard the philosophy part in other superhero movies. ","6"
"Arrow",2013-07-28," Stephen Amell brings us a more serious Oliver Queen as opposed to the obvious comparison from Smallville (where Justin Hartley, while amazing, wasn't the leading actor and thus the character's story wasn't as much emphasized). While it doesn't completely stay true to the comics it still portrays the characters amazingly and the cast is superb. The show doesn't only bring DC Comics fans a lot of familiar characters, but also manages to incorporate the origin story in a wonderful mix. After one season I can say that it is one of the best comic-book series out there and I would recommend it to anyone who enjoys a more serious series around comic-book characters who kick ass and yet bring a lot of emotion to the table.The show doesn't have a lot of comedic relief which I usually appreciate in serious shows, but It's harder to review a work-in-progress and I look forward to seeing what they are planning to do next. The writers definitely know what they are doing. ","9"
"Arrow",2013-07-27," This show is so very unpredictable that even me (who is good at guessing what is going to happen next) can't see what's coming. This show is amazing and has too me on a long ride of superhero drama. Every episode ending is basically a cliff hanger that leaves you questioning either, every thing about the story or everything about the characters. The acting is amazing. Stephen Amel as our Emerald Archer is one of the best casting choices I've seen on T.V. The rest of the cast also work so well with each other and Katie Cassidy is brilliant as well. I praise this show so much because I think it is well done in every area. The action is brilliant and suspense filled which is good because it goes so well with the theme of the show. Arrow is such a young show and is going to grow and become even better (if that's possible) and I personally can't wait to see Summer Glau in the next season because season two is going to be spectacular.

"Arrow",2013-07-26," its just amazing. i love the action scenes. but they said its Action | Adventure | Crime but they forgot to add drama there's like 10 minutes of that. but still an awesome show you have to watch it.. but the comic is a bit different. i mean if you read this which is an analysis of his life, ( http://dc.wikia.com/wiki/Green_Arrow_(Oliver_Queen)) its kinda different... and it would be cooler if they get one or two characters of the justice league to help. batman would be awesome with him. batman's life and arrows are kinda similar, i mean there both billionaire vigilantes. like imagine if arrow was kidnapped in Gotham City and batman comes and helps him, and then tells him to join the justice league :D.

"Arrow",2013-07-20," Its been long since I dumped the Smallville as it became awful somewhere from season 7 or 8. It had an Oliver Queen too. Now, this guy from Arrow  as Oliver is aggressive and passionate about what he is doing. The story begins somewhat in a usual manner but then moving with nice pace of twists and revelations. It could be boring if you think too much about it, but for a regular viewer looking for just fresh  superhero without superpower  entertainment, you have a winner here. True, any other character except Oliver is not detailed, they are just out of the box, but the real character is not them, hence its understandable. Acting is a vital point here, Stephen Amell does a real fine job characterizing the Green Arrow. Paul Blackthorne is great as a cop. Other characters such as Colon Donnel, Susana Thompson are doing nice too. Its a nice superhero series, you will love it as I do too. I give it a 9/10 for the nice time pass. Cheers. ","9"
"Arrow",2013-07-16," If you can look past the horrid acting, the more than just lacking substance plot and the under developed characters - this series is for you. But then again, if you watch something based on the leads six-pack, somber mood and distant stares then you will love this poorly created series. Personally I prefer stories of substance, a tale with progress, characters and a protagonist that has more going for him/her than just a pretty face or/and chiseled abs. It is hard to believe that Arrow has survived critics and audiences and has made it to a renewal of a second season. It's sad to see quality writing i.e Smash be removed from channels and hogwash such as Arrow be allowed to fill the mind of the average intelligent human. ","2"
"Arrow",2013-07-16," I really like this show, the first season was really entertaining and ended great! I really enjoy the contrast between the events happening during his time off and on the island.My dislike of this show stems from the really terrible teeny bop music they play during  Emotional  moments in the show, I feel like doing this kills a lot of good shows, as a 28 year old male who still loves super heroes.....I just don't need teeny bop music to be playing during my shows it kills it for me.Get rid of the crap music and replace it with some strong classical pieces that help bring the emotion you want the audience to feel closer than this crap...Half the time I skip through the parts with the cheese music.Highly recommended for those who enjoy super heroes, action, enjoyable story and strong characters. ","8"
"Arrow",2013-07-16," I have seen all 23 episodes of Arrow, and honestly I'm pretty impressed. I believe this is inspired by Nolan's Dark Knight trilogy, but I don't think that it's a ripoff. For me, the show is never boring. It is like the combination between teen drama and the Dark Knight trilogy. Speaking of realism, this show is not realistic at all. Oliver with Diggle and Felicity seem to have any solution to every kind of problems, well it doesn't matter at all since this is a comic book adaptation. As much as I love this show, I still think the show is so flawed. The cast aren't that good, well they are okay. Sometimes what really bothers me is the dialogs, it is so f-in cliché. The dialog is so fake that's filled with cheesy words that we'd NEVER say in real life. What I like most about the show are the action and the plot. The plot is very good, the crimes never seem to end, and I loved every episode in the series.As much as how flawed the show is, it's pretty darn entertaining. It's obviously not Breaking Bad or game of Thrones, but it's one of the most entertaining shows in TV today.! ","8"
"Arrow",2013-06-27," If someone had asked me how I evaluate the new CW serial 'Arrow', my single answer would be,  Boring . But, at the first place i was not less excited than anyone else when i heard the Green Arrow comics gonna be adapted in a TV serial. Who doesn't want to see his favorite comic character moving alive in TV screen? But Arrow has despaired me in every possible ways. The 1st episode was interesting and it had started well. But throughout the whole season we have observed same old monotonous story lines, poor dialogs, dull acting and the hero wins it all things. The Character development was very poor. After watching the whole season i'm still not sure about the relationship of Oliver and Laurel. It appeared more bizarre when the previous day Olliver tries to make things normal between Tommy and Laurel and the next day he bangs her! A superhero needs to have some self respect!! The character of Thea Queen was also a disorganized one. A good storyline could diverse all other faults of this kind of TV serial. But unfortunately the plots were very predictable and it will make u bore. There were another storyline where we were shown how Oliver had become 'The Arrow  in an island and by which the directors had tried to give it a  Lost  flavor, but in vain. There is no ups and downs in the story. Its plain and simple and which is boring. In a word its very hard to keep the patience to watch all the episodes of the season. Stephen Amell has done well enough as oliver queen. He seemed pretty good in action scenes. But, in emotional ones sometimes he made me laugh!! I can remember at the season finale while he was holding Tommy's head and screaming in his name, I never felt any kind of sorrow but laughed by watching the poor performance of him. I liked to watch Kate Cassidy on the screen. She is both sexy and beautiful. The Character of Felicity Smoak was the only interesting character i guess. This character had some punch lines, humorous dialogs and the actress who did this role( I don't know her name) did well enough. Whatever, after watching the 1st season i can ensure you that, i'm not gonna waste my time for the next season and I'm not gonna recommend this to anybody. ","5"
"Arrow",2013-06-26," As for the very first review by The__Captain5, someone must have stolen his girlfriend or something, and that review is about as far from what this show is as could be found. I think ARROW is an amazing show. Well-cast, and I especially like the flashbacks to his time on the island that sheds so much information on how he changed from the billionaire playboy, waste of space he used to be into the ARROW really adds a lot of valuable layers to the story.The multiple faces of so many of the characters. His bodyguard is a morally-driven ex soldier looking to be a part of something greater. The mother, who has deftly tried to play both sides of the game and constantly stays in danger of losing all she loves if she slips up. Couldn't believe she sacrificed her husband to go along with the plan for Starling City's future. The neverending relationship with Laurel, who in my opinion is about the most impossibly gorgeous leading-lady I have seen in quite some time. I am Katie Cassidy's biggest fan, by a long shot. ","10"
"Arrow",2013-06-24," Being a lesser known character in the DC universe, the show's creators have been wise in using the TV format to successfully sell Green Arrow, since it allows them to use the detail in comics to a greater extent. Despite the fact that I watched the first season with great zeal I have to admit that its severely flawed ...i.e. from wooden acting generally to weak dialogues to recurring plot holes there is a lot to be worthy of criticism. However, contrary to the above Arrow does provide some great entertainment with particular mention of its stunts and a number of interesting characters. I personally found Jessica DeGouw as The Huntress to be the best thing about the first season, she depicts the dark edgy character of hers quite wonderfully followed by Manu Benett (as Slade Wilson) and Sebastian Dunn (as Edward Fyers). WATCH OUT FOR: Great action sequences, good story buildup, episodes starring The Huntress Conclusion: Highly recommended if you like vigilantes, not so much if you don't....7/10! ","7"
"Arrow",2013-06-23," As a comic book fan, I was actually looking forward to this after finishing up Smallville. I thought it was a spin-off of Smallville. When I found out that the lead wasn't Justin Hartley, I was doubtful of how this show would be. It was then when I watched it that I realized. Turned out, it has a very dark and gritty tone unlike Smallville. Initially, I didn't know much about Green Arrow and didn't have high expectations for this show. I watched it with the expectations of knowing the origins of Green Arrow and stuff from the comics. However, it turned out very differently. From the 3rd episode onwards, the more I watched it, the more interested I got. And this TV series takes the risk of changing many stuff from the comics. And it turned out great. Superman and Batman are my favorite superheroes. This has the dark and gritty tone of Batman but is a totally different story. Its not about a man whose parents died and he turns into a man of vengeance, but its about a man whose father sacrificed himself hoping that his son would help him make things right.The best parts of the TV show throughout was the flashbacks. As the story progresses, flashbacks appear, and gradually reveal more about what happened to Oliver on the island. Slade and Yao Fei are really bad- ass characters, and I always hope for more flashbacks.There are consistent nods to the comics, for the comic book fans. However, this show is also suited for non-comic book fans, as you don't really need to know much about Green Arrow from the comics. The introduction of Deadshot and Huntress were really cool parts of the story, and they also serve to add on more comic-book goodness.Slade Wilson was really well-portrayed in the series. I liked how he was actually not the villain of the story, as I thought he would be after seeing his iconic mask. All the main casts in the story were rather good.I am really looking forward to Season 2. I would really love it if they bring in more characters from the comics. I know that the story focuses on non-super powered heroes. Green Arrow had a friendship with Hal Jordan since young. They could bring in Hal Jordan as a pilot, and not as Green Lantern as there is definitely no chance of that, but it would really be cool to see him appear somehow or another. Stephen Amell is really great as he can act convincingly well. You can see the difference of mannerism between the past Oliver(flashback), the current Oliver, and as Green Arrow (or the Hood/the Vigilante) as he is known as by others. ","9"
"Arrow",2013-06-19," This show has so much potential and I want to love it but can't due to many reasons; The acting/directing can be pretty poor at times. I expected so much more from the fighting scenes.. but they're just not believable (In one of the episodes, a villain was about to shoot the  green Arrow  but you can see how he waited to be punched instead). The story is too predictable. What's been happening so far on the island is just ridiculous and boring and doesn't make much connection with how Oliver is now a changed man, how skilled he is as a fighter and how hurtful the whole experience was!! I've been watching the episodes back to back, thats the only reason why I'm kept interested but I can't see how someone can religiously follow this week by week. ","5"
"Arrow",2013-06-16," This show is not exactly the best show ever but it's certainly better than many other superhero shows. And it does try to look and feel like the Dark Knight, but is clearly restrained by it's budget.The first episode got me hooked, but after that the next few episodes were not that great. The acting was very mediocre, especially Katie Cassidy's, but it got better towards the end of the season.However one of the best things about this show is the action. A lot of the budget goes into the action so it looks pretty cool. Also, there are these flashbacks to when Oliver was trapped on the island, which include some of the best sequences of the show. These island sequences are the reason I watched every single episode. Also, the show has got a glossy look. They have also tried to bring in many of the characters from the comics. But because of this the first few episodes feel forced and we go through each villain every episode. Although it picks up pace after the 10th episode, and we start getting to the main storyline, after which I must say the screenwriters did a really good job.I know 10 is high for this show, but the finale was dazzling and the next season is definitely going to be brilliant. Just hope they increase the budget though.Overall, it's a great show scattered with a few slippery episodes,shoddy acting, but gets better as it progresses to the ending after which it seems amazing.Definitely worth checking out. ","10"
"Arrow",2013-06-10," OK, so we've seen this sort of thing before - multi-billionaire suffers a crisis and comes back as a hard as nails vigilante to defend his city (Batman anyone...) but what people seem to be failing to recognise is that this is based on a comic book from DC Comics. So the acting isn't fantastic, the lead character manages about two facial expressions an episode, and the CGI effects aren't brilliant but at the end of the day it is a show you can sit and watch without having to concentrate too much, it provides 45 minutes of entertainment and to be fair I find it pretty entertaining.People are saying that it isn't realistic, or how does he suddenly have access to gadgets that can break super secret computer firewalls when he is purely a kid etc etc. If you want realism, watch a documentary. This is a work of fiction, based on some drawings for kids. Stop questioning the laws of physics, reality or common sense, sit back and enjoy the show. ","8"
"Arrow",2013-06-10," Plot is good. Storyline too. Actors-bad, very bad. There is almost no humor, directing is bad. Almost every scene is stupid, he always escapes magically. They could have done a better job with this story. Acting is stiff and there is virtually no emotions between the actors. Characters are poorly built, we don't know anything about them, and the part where the inspector arrests the man who he thinks killed his daughter on the yacht with no evidence at all, and his other daughter his former girlfriend who he cheated on with her sister is defending him :D oh come on :DTo summarize it all up: 4/10 from me and I just can believe this series has just 1.3 points less then Game of thrones and Breaking bad.Disappointment. ","4"
"Arrow",2013-06-04," What more can I say. Love the plot. Love the acting. Love the guys. Oops, Ill keep that to myself. Glad to see Colton Haynes from Teen Wolf is on the show. Looking forward to more of this talented actor. Stephen is amazing, love his personality.Disappointed the season is over, but am very pleased and can't wait for season two. I just hope it doesn't get canceled. Glad it is on CW it definitely has a fighting chance, their program mangers are a lot brighter than ABC that gives up on everything in it's first season because 25 million viewers is not their acceptable billion for determining how popular a show is. Oops, did I digress?This hand in hand with Beauty and the Beast are a nice addition to CW's already awesome programming schedule. A definite winner in my book. ","10"
"Arrow",2013-06-04," After a very long time...a show like  Arrow  have been telecast-ed...this show has everything for one who is fond of viewing Batman like superhero series.Very good acting,direction is excellent,cinematography is too good.It's a complete package TV show.Plot of this show is so refreshing,excellent that you will get addict to this show.This show is for the one's who are tired of watching shows who have slow plots,supernatural activities,extreme comedy etc.Once you have watched  pilot ..your excitement will grow even more and one would want to see all the episodes one after another.1st season has been up to the mark.Hope to have a glance of 2nd season soon. ","10"
"Arrow",2013-06-02," This show is bad, period. The only reason is watched it is so that I can bitch about it. It has characters and scenes ripped out of Batman Begins. Come on, with all that budget, you could have at least made an effort. Batman and Robin with Adam West was more entertaining and one could argue, more genuine. They had the formula, they knew they were being cheesy and they knew they were making it for kids. Sold. But Arrow is as lame as they come.Stephen Amell, dude, nice work with the body building but you could have shaved off some of that hard jaw gritting internalizing stuff. He looked like he was constipated most of the time and the man was simply trying too hard to portray Oliver Queen as a conflicted, damaged and deeply hurt. It was simply not believable. Laurel Lance, oh, Laurel, couldn't one of those arrows accidentally misfired and killed her in episode 1? Laurel's character is a bimbo who wants to save the world and expects to be fed the truth by everyone she has a relationship with. The audience of course wonders why anyone would be truthful to this girl if she simply is not about to handle the truth.The saving grace of this entire waste of money comes in the form of David Ramsey who plays Diggle and Paul Blackthorne who plays Quentin Lance. Brilliant actors who do it well. If Stephen Amell did not have Davd Ramsey to bounce off a lot of scenes off, he'd be a dead fish floating on the river Nile for all one would care.I could go on but in all fairness, the actors worked hard. I give em that. The fault really lies with the writing and direction. It's movie making at it's worst. The show is forgettable. Or maybe to be more accurate, this show will be remembered only because it is so bad.I'm giving it two stars - one star for David Ramsey and one for Paul Blackthorne. ","2"
"Arrow",2013-05-13," I haven't usually liked CW's shows, but 'Arrow' has really changed my mind about this. Basically Arrow is about this rich kid, Oliver Queen who wastes all his time and money with women and cars. One day his father invites him to go with him on a cruise. Oliver brings his girlfriend, Laurel's sister ''Sara'. There he cheats on Laurel with Sara. The 'Queens Gambit'(The Cruise) sinks, with only Oliver surviving. Before the fathers death, he gives Oliver a list. If Oliver would survive, he should take out everyone on that list. He finds an Island where he has to survive by any means necessary.The show starts 5 years later, where he has come home. He starts a dobbel life, where he partly is  The Hood , who is wearing a green outfit and hood. He also uses the Bow and Arrow as his main weapon. The Hoods objective is to take out all people on the list his father gave to him.As Oliver Queen, he tries to reconnect with his family and friends, which is very hard for him since he has become a Whole different person after the Island.Throughout the series, there are many flashbacks from his time on the Island, which i actually find one of the most interesting parts of the show.All in all this is a great and interesting series, where you can see how much such an experience on an Island, where you have to take care of yourself to survive can change you. ","9"
"Arrow",2013-05-09," Watching Arrow TV series has been a pleasure for me, as I am a fan of such movies, but with every next series I have that feeling and approval of my feeling, that I have seen such scenario already before!Let's start with the introduction part! Haven't you seen such scenario already before?: Millionaire playboy is missing-presumed-dead. He returns ... years later as a changed man, determined to clean up the city as a .... armed with a ... . This is almost 100% the same scenario as Batman. After introduction - main guidelines goes into Spider-man trilogy. If you remember the Spider-man trilogy, then you know that all goes something like that: 1. Two best friends - one girl; (same here) 2. The good guy gets some skills and fights against the evil in the city; 3. The girl starts to meet the other guy, but the good guy still loves her. 4. The good guy in hero costume saves The girl, and she fells in love with the hero, not knowing who he is; 5. The hero gets in fight with his friends dad, who appears to be the evil of the city (some moments before you get to know that evil dad has a secret room with his evil costume inside, that the son almost sees). 6. Evil dad has a big fight with a hero and after this fight he knows who the Hero really is. (same here) next part still has not been shown, but it seems that it will include those things: 7. Hero has a last fight with Evil dad, in which Evil dad gets killed; 8. Son of the evil dad gets to know who was the killer, he also somehow finds the secret room and the costume; 9. The son starts his revenge tour around the city and also goes into evil dad's steps. etc.So hopefully the ending of the TV series will be original or at least taken from some different movie than spider-man. ","7"
"Arrow",2013-05-09," I do not usually write reviews but maybe for some bad criticism from other people I would like to state my opinion. This show had a really bad start but after watching some more episodes the plot holes and everything started to get wrapped up... I really like Stephen Amells acting as he tries to be both a rich billionaire and at the same time a deadly vigilante. The only thing that bothers me a little bit is the bad written villains that appear on the show...and I think it gets fixed on later episodes... I hope that it will somewhat blend with other DC superheros in the near future.Just give this show a chance and you will not regret it. ","9"
"Arrow",2013-05-01," I didn't saw it then throw the arrow.he is lost in island.but he is very developed.he has evolved.wow!! how I am realized the good film? for example:scenario is perfect,characters have the role of the done better. in fact, oliver attempts to correct old errors in normal life with father's day is the night destroys opponents arrow.Arrow is definitely a very good, and the name can be traced in the list of arrays.and we can saw.series is good started.The scenario is different and not to stereotype writers.But it is more difficult to bring an event as soon as you finish each chapter, such as habits, I hope. Let's do a deep subject as fictional, transported, ","8"
"Arrow",2013-04-30," I'll just say what has already been said. Weakly written characters. Weakly acted characters. Exaggerated reactions to everything. The words nuance, range and depth seem lost on whoever is choosing the final scripts. Bad music and badly timed music. Inane dialog. Occasionally good action and even that dwindled by the 10th episode. I have also ended up skipping through parts that seem so soap operaish which comprises about 70% of each episode. I don't claim at all to know the effort it takes to write good characters or even more difficult inter-character relationships but I'm sure I could have done a better job or at least decided to stop writing. ","1"
"Arrow",2013-04-27," I've decided to contribute here merely to counter those who have written bad reviews based on the first episode or two.This is one of those shows that will only make sense as the episodes go by, I assure you all the illogical things that ticked you off in the beginning will start to make sense after a while. Yes, even Oliver's penchant for technology and electronics, as one reviewer pointed out he couldn't have possibly gathered such an elaborate system in the club's secret room after five years away from civilization...or so we thought.This show relies on flashbacks, the editing is smart and smooth, especially when the same theme is tackled in each episode comparing Island Oliver with Present-Day Oliver. So, to all new viewers, stop being so impatient. This series relies both on action and psychology, it has a lot of character development, so yes, if you're here only to see bad people getting their butt kicked, you will be disappointed. The acting is a bit off at times, true, but the actors are extremely charismatic, and clearly comfortable in their respective roles.Looking forward to Season 2. ","7"
"Arrow",2013-04-27," To be honest I do not understand how this show has such a great rating, it is the worst show I have ever watched, cheesy and stupid... Nothing original ever happens, just bunch of dramatic characters, I mean how many times will Thea cry over the same thing and do something impulsive, it happens in every episode, they should come up with a better excuse. Secondly its not sensible, 'The Hood' does not cover his face, its very obvious who he is especially when he's fighting his whole face shows so how can people not realize it, I mean if you're gong to make a show about superheroes at least make the watchers fall for it, such as batman or spiderman , all of them covered their faces its logic. Simply terrible. ","1"
"Arrow",2013-04-25," What I love about the Arrow series is that we are following a hero with PTSD which isn't a  Super Hero  like we see in Smallville. Arrow is a human with no supernatural powers which a love about this show. Amell is also doing a great job portraying Oliver Queen as a guy with PTSD. The flash backs to the island is definitely something I give the show credit for! It gets way more interesting to see how he became the so called  Arrow  or  The Hood  if you will. But when you are watching Arrow have in mind that the manuscript is not meant to be realistic such as Dexter or white collar. It is more like a crazy hero kicking some bad guys asses! You should not watch the show based on the realism because it isn't logical. An example is the revenge vs. justice logic. Oliver want to see the bad guys in prison and will not kill for revenge but this isn't happening in some episodes. Another example is that Oliver don't want to hurt innocent but he kills all the bad guys bodyguards.All in all it is a fantastic show to watch with lots of action! But if you are looking for a realistic and logical series this is not the one to watch! ","10"
"Arrow",2013-04-25," I was pretty excited about this and it started off well. However, soon there were loose ends which grew so much that it took the fun out of it.It doesn't take a genius to tell that this series doesn't have a good script. Yes, there is a good past, a decent present and a hopeful future but nothing ties them together. Some scenes are so obvious that it makes me angry.It looks to me that Stephen Amell didn't really understand his role which is again a turnoff. His acting is bland. He doesn't really exude a personality one would expect out of the  Arrow  in the script.It has a similarity to batman with billionaire in disguise and all. But, Batman was really nice, this is not. The playboy setups up camp in his father's abandoned factory. The masked vigilante appears as soon as he gets back and no one doubts him. Not even his mother. Like I said a lot of loop holes.I stopped watching after the fifth episode so, if they have improved which I am pretty sure that they haven't, then I wouldn't know. ","3"
"Arrow",2013-04-24," Okay, I really don't get the negative reviews, this show plays on the CW, what do you expect, Band of Brothers or something? Everyone knows the CW's thing is entertaining romance/drama story lines with occasional action aimed at young adults and teens. You don't go into a McDonald's and ask for a Taco just like you don't watch a CW show expecting phenomenal award winning acting and a poetic script with some deep underlying message. The show is very entertaining, the action sequences are done surprisingly very well, and I actually like the characters, albeit they need a little more development and more facial expression options. The show does its job, it keeps me entertained and anxious for the next episode. Remember kids, you don't go into a McDonald's and ask for a goddamn hot dog. ","9"
"Arrow",2013-04-24," If I was to give an alternative title for Arrow,  the sad demise of all straight men  would be it. In a parallel gay universe, our robotic hero goes through a series of ordeals armed with a ridiculous bow and arrows, barging head first, like a fool and spreading havoc among his numerous enemies with his terrible make up and constipated acting style.The series started with an interesting episode chuck-full of parkour stunts (which are the strong asset that made me stick around for more) but sadly followed the well treaded path to Trivialville through Soggy Valley. At the moment it stands well into the region of Unwatchable where nothing-really-happens-ever!The script and dialogue are badly written and use vague and simplistic words that don't really say anything, in a futile effort to suggest that there is something going on. How many times does one have to hear of  the undertaking  or  the bad guys  before he changes the channel? The lack of plot or real action is supposedly balanced by drama and moral dilemmas. Well, let me tell you, a bulldozer could run over any of the main characters of the series and I wouldn't blink an eye because a. I don't care about any of them and b. they are paper thin, they couldn't get any flatter. They don't even seem to care for each other: someone disappears and no one mentions him again after two episodes. Stereotypes like the ex-marine, the computer geek, the criminally rich, the (not really) beautiful and sensitive idealized female, the tough cop, the spoiled playboy and the  cursed  but moral hero all appear in their most unoriginal incarnations possible. Biggest minus of the script: no male character seems to be genuinely attracted to women...Biggest minus of the series lies with the cast of mediocre actors. Several sport fake English accent for no apparent reason, one speaks terrible Aussie and there is a British one that fakes American accent... go figure. Best actor in the show would be the central character's mother and that's just because everyone else is soooo baaaaad. Worst actor goes to Oliver-Arrow, the star himself (there are several other horrible actors but they don't get to annoy me for as long). How can anyone base a show on this guy is beyond me. His acting skills are next to null and he tries so hard to appear like a bad-ass that he usually accomplishes the opposite. In doing so however, he serves as a comic relief and perhaps can be watchable when the intention is to laugh at someone. For me this show accomplished something that I didn't know was possible. It made me dislike the comic as well so I give it a point for originality there. Also for the laugh I occasionally got from Oliver's acting (especially when he does his serious walk, or he tries to look pensive, or emotional...) it gets another point and this brings us to the total of 2 instead of 0. OK, seriously now. The one thing that Arrow has to offer and I genuinely enjoy is parkour, but it seems to be getting omitted as the series progress.I leave you with two questions: Is Stephen Amell the worst actor on planet earth? Does anyone wear more make-up than Katie Kassidy? ","2"
"Arrow",2013-04-23," This TV series amazed me,but at first i thought it was just about shooting with arrows,but later intrigued me a lot. Much less is spoken but acted and to this,it makes a viewer engrossed rather than to try to listen the story line. The down side of this piece of art is the fact that never in anywhere will an arrow shooter be sharper and lethal in reaction to someone with m14 or a revolver. i like the switches that the writer makes between the scenes,as of the live of the Oliver Queen at the island jungle and the recent life of civilization.the relationship among the character are perfect though there is no concrete base for such relations. the concept of this writer is good,though it needs some further dramatic ideas or transition to avoid the so long lists of Oliver's targets.

"Arrow",2013-04-22," Save yourself the time with this one unless your less than about 12 years old or have a very low IQ.It's like the ideas been pieced together from other shows. It's stupid, inconsistent, hypocritical, ridiculous, and most of the acting is terrible.It's a pity because the underlying story with the mother and her associates is the shows only redemption. You just have to sit through the agony of the rest of the show to get this. Maybe they should save us all the heartache and just tell us what happens with that story line. ","1"
"Arrow",2013-04-18," I suspect many of the negative reviews are from comic fanboys who are enraged that the show doesn't fit their preconceived ideas of what you a Green 'Arrow' show should be. The hallmark of the obsessed fan is clear in the slightly nonsensical and over- emotional reviews.This is not a typical superhero show, placing much greater emphasis on the characters' psychology and private lives. It appears that emotions and psychology are beyond the understanding of those who only appreciate 'wham-bam' action. Take, for instance, the current highest rated review by 'The_Captain5'. He completely misses the point that Oliver's deadpan response to hearing of Tommy's relationship with Laurel is not bad acting (or writing) but deliberately scripted as an indication of his emotional coldness and scarred psyche as a result of being on the island. And who says Tommy is a comic sidekick? You are criticising the show for NOT conforming to stereotype? It is not the Royal Shakespeare Company but I don't see the bad acting claimed by other reviewers. Instead I see a superhero show bravely trying to be different. ","8"
"Arrow",2013-04-16," So I'm just going to post a quick review of this series because it makes me angry how it got 8,2 points despite it's many (!) mistakes. I mean you give 8 points to a series/movie that has at least good story, is engaging for most people, and delivers some good acting. This series's selling point is that it's about a comic book hero with great background in story and mythology, and why this series could be considered great. But the acting is so bad, I lost all my will to see what happens next. The actors play like in a soap opera, their lines feel like you are hit by a wet rug on the head. It's a mistake in writing and acting. I suppose if you enjoyed Smallvile you might warm up to this one, but while you could still give a 6ish to that one, this only delivers 4 and a half, let's make it 5 out of empathy. If you are a teenage/young/sex hungry girl/woman I guess you would keep watching, for the abs and stuff, but otherwise, the Force is just not with this one if you want some minimal quality. ","5"
"Arrow",2013-04-08," + Super robin hood-inspired hero with cool bow and arrows fighting bad guys - Check + Good storyline that offers more subject matters than centers around a hero hunting criminals every day - Check + Moral aspects - Check + Hot girls - Double check ( and i mean girlS )This show have easily made it to the list of my most favorite TV shows of 2013. At first i really love the idea of a hero using bow and arrows as a choice of weapon and signature mark because robin hood was one of my childhood heroes. But thats not entirely the reason why this show has literally caught my heart. Simply because it differs. Its not merely just about action scenes with a hero hunting and fighting and kicking criminals asses in many different ways, its about the inside of a survival man once stranded on an isolated island for a hell of 5 years now came back to fulfill his promise to his passed-away dad and how he comes to resolve and reconnect with his loving family after all the long lost time. I really love how the shows chooses to center around the moral aspects between what is right and what is wrong, with the gray area that really shades your thinking of how to right the wrong. Family conflicts and responsibilities are also a huge success of the show. Lying between all the lies and a hooded cowl is the face of a man who has struggled to keep the promise to his dad to eliminate all the sources that poison his city where he grew up. That very same man also has to resolve with himself trying to find a line between hiding behind a figure to fight for what he believes in while as the same time being a responsible home-coming son, a brother who closes the distance in a broken-heart family.Yet he longs for love, for someone who he really can share his secrets and his life.Simly put, if you are looking for a good super hero stuff with all the actions as well as the story behind a hero, i really recommend watching this show.

"Arrow",2013-04-04," I came here to check the reviews and I was mislead. So here I am, hoping that people will see this and not bother. First thing that you notice is the bad acting(personal opinion) and man that is annoying.The show itself is decent but not much of plot development and the story is repeating and boring. So unless they have something hidden that is gonna blow our mind I'm gonna have to stop watching this show. If you have a lot of time to spend you can watch it but don't expect much from it or you will be very very disappointed. Another thing that hits you after a couple episode is the over the board acting with punch line here and there. I know it sounds like a lot of hate but just so you know this is my first review in IMDb I always come here to check some of them. This show is overrated and doesn't deserve the reviews in here. ","2"
"Arrow",2013-04-01," I agree with rasmusu-437-373780 in everything he writes in his review of this series and I would like to add a little to it.Some might blame the poor result on the budget but that's just not right. Removing silly things like the waterfall in the Arrows HQ would actually have saved money (Really? A waterfall in an abandoned factory in the middle of New York/Starling City? That's just stupid.)Writing a solid manuscript isn't more expensive than writing a manuscript with holes the size of the moon in it either. For example: One day Moira Queens (mother of Arrow) driver is away and John Diggle (Arrows partner) steps in to drive her to a party. As they get in to the car she thanks him for stepping in and tells him that she can't remember the last time her driver was away from his job. Later that night Diggle talks to Arrow and says that he's been driving her around for a couple of days. Say what?This is just two small examples of annoying details in the series. The thing is that it's riddled with them. Every episode contains these kinds of mistakes.Another thing: Is it just a fluke that Arrow/Oliver Queen (Stephen Amell) talks EXACTLY like Harvey Spector (Gabriel Macht) in Suits or is it yet another thing the makers stole from another series? ","5"
"Arrow",2013-03-26," So I've see 8 episodes now, and this is it for me. The story line is trite and predictable, the acting is sub par and the hero is frankly an idiot.I've seen people on here talking about how this is an  alternative  take on the vigilante/superhero story, and that it's mysterious and dark and to that I say: really? Have you seen ANY TV? Because this is neither  alternative  mysterious or dark. It is down the middle of Bland Road to Boredom..There is literally NOTHING, no really, Not. One. Single. Detail. about this shot that is original in any way.. All I want now is for the  hero , his family and his friends is that they are locked up for life for being awful at everything that they do... Really.. If not for the decent production value this would be a less entertaining Batman (the one with Adam West). Don't waste your time on this. ","3"
"Arrow",2013-03-25," This review is from the perspective of not having read the comic series. It only concerns the pilot episode of Arrow season one.After having watched the first episode of the show I was left with a feeling of watching stereotypical characters, plot lines and character motivations. The, formerly, douche bag playboy Oliver Queen have the need to right wrongs caused by his father(?), but can't show the world his new, true self. Especially to his ex girlfriend, who he cheated with her sister, because if she gets close to him she will get hurt by his soon-to-be enemies. Obviously he longs for her, but his vigilante heroics have to take precedence.His family can't be bothered to travel to their son/brother that's been missing-presumed-dead for five years. His mother shows up when he's been checked out at the local hospital. His sister glides down the stairs when is brought back to their mansion and exclaims how much she's missed him. Olivers ex is of course fighting for justice in the  proper  way of using the law as a tool as opposed to Arrows use of illegal force to get things done. Her father also happens to be the detective that investigate all the Arrow-events that somehow seem to gravitate around Oliver Queen.The series is based on an old comic series, but in this day and age I'd hoped that the producers could do something to create more believable characters instead of cartoon stereotypes. It clearly shows the drawback of using established IPs. ","3"
"Arrow",2013-03-24," the whole storyline is exactly the same as Spiderman, apart from him being on an island for 5 years. He is a vigilante, fights crime, his best friend is with the girl he actually loves, and his best friends father is his enemy but he doesn't know that it's him yet. EXACTLY like in the Spiderman movie with Tobie McGuire and Kirstin dunst. I hope i'm not the only one that sees that? And also, almost every episode the bad guy is in a abandoned warehouse talking to his bodyguards, when suddenly the light shuts down, all the bodyguards are killed or knocked out, and then he talks to the bad guy. Come on can't you think of something new??But despite all this I must say, i'm still watching it just to find out what happened to him on the Island, because that does make me curious. Talking about the island i remember something else, too many times he says: on the island.. bla bla bla, and: you don't know what happened to me on the island bla bla bla. That gets old too. ","6"
"Arrow",2013-03-23," Well one of the few things I dislike is the fact that Deathstroke's been reduced to a henchman in this show. I mean I won't pretend to be a comics buff, but from what I've heard, he's supposed to be borderline superhuman and is an expert in tactics and battles, and is more of a 'mastermind' character. In this show, although his appearances are small, it's a noticeable flaw in his character. Other characters seem to be decently developed. Story line is fresh. A milestone in TV superhero shows. I'd like this show to tread carefully, however. There are lots of shows with amazing first seasons, but then got cocky and messed up the second *coughWALKINGDEADcough* ","9"
"Arrow",2013-03-17," I wish I have better things to say about this show. Unfortunately I have none. I won't complain too much about the execution of the badly written scripts. I have seen them before and I can stomach that to an extent. What made me throw cold water on it is its bad acting. Stephen Amell has the most inexpressive face among the guys I've seen playing the lead role. The girls who are mostly present for ornamental reasons (thanks to the writers) also manage to actively support Amell in his able job. It left me with a feel of watching a B-grade material. They had a promising start with the narrative going back and forth between the time when Ollie was marooned and Arrow fighting injustice in Star city. I guess that's all there is to it till the end or up until I watched it. The plot didn't spend time in developing any of the other characters. The lines were not bad, but none of them will ever stick with you. If one is looking for action, entertaining plot or pretty faces, it would pass. ","1"
"Arrow",2013-03-17," Being more a DC than Marvel comics fan, I'm familiar with the (Green) Arrow character Oliver Queen, but, in the manner of Smallville, from the same production company, the links to the original character are fairly tenuous. This modern-day archer has the same social conscience, but is barely in his 20's, has a six-pack, can't seem to grow a beard and doesn't even use the Green Arrow moniker. Moreover, his social conscience takes the form of hunting down the corrupt former associates of his ruthless billionaire father, following a boat trip which goes wrong, claiming the life of his then girl-friend's sister with whom he's having a fling and after-ward his father too who brutally sacrifices himself and another survivor so that his golden boy son can later return to their dirty old town and clean it up.Pauses for breath...,that's a lot of back story and there's more as our hero tries to make it up with his former girlfriend now a firebrand crime-busting young attorney but who won't forgive him for going with her sister, plus her dad just happens to be the local chief commissioner who naturally hates his guts for losing his other daughter and did I mention his scheming mother and her new lover, together now in control of her late husband's business operation and his truculent younger sister with the giveaway nickname of Speedy (GA's  Robin -type sidekick in the comics) so that there are plenty of characters and plot strands to develop.I'm only two episodes into the first series and what I can say without doubt is that this show is obviously targeted at a younger demographic than me. The Arrow character owes too much as a crusading spoilt rich boy to a certain resident of Gotham City (he's even got an  Alfred -type bodyguard watching his back) while the producers aren't above stealing a few riffs from the their rival publisher's Spider Man character (Laurel's dad is a cipher for J Jonah Jameson) so that one can easily see why Queen's character would never make it on the big screen.That said, it's directed very much in the modern style, with fast cuts and dynamic action sequences although I'd like to know how our boy can shoot everyone with his arrows and not kill them, while the characterisations really are comic-book paper thin and the hero's Labours Of Hercules quest will I fear become too predictable.The acting is serviceable with no one trying too hard probably because they don't have to but if I've nothing better to do i'll maybe occasionally dip in to watch this glossy but rather facile entertainment in the future. ","5"
"Arrow",2013-03-14," OK guys, this my first post, so bear with me for a moment and be patient. Most of the negativity toward this series comes from the beginning of the show. Later on, it gets more over the characters motivations and background. there's no black and withe pictured as blunt of most of the Super hero theme goes. If you go over the layers of superficial good looking actors and actresses or the wealth of the families to lure some of the superficial folks all over the world you could see a deep plot, well written and properly set during the show duration so far. All the troubles that the Arrow dude goes trough are easy to connect with if you are willing to. And his motivations and the island period are a very nice twist to the show. that said, I think it has lots of potential to success over the last Super hero TV shows we had in the past, some one remembers Smallville? There's a good reason behind the motivations and there's lots of consequences after their choices are made. So bear with the show after the first 5 episodes, you will not be disappointed. ","8"
"Arrow",2013-03-04," Full disclosure - I love superheros. That being said, this show has reminded me what it is like to love an actual TV show. I am excited every Thursday to find out what happens next. The story is great, the action is great, and the main characters are, for the most part, great. A couple of times every episode I am reminded that I am watching a TV show on the CW. That being said, the show is entertaining enough where it doesn't drag me out of the story and suspense.If you enjoy superhero shows or movies, you should definitely check this one out. It is definitely a new leaf for the CW network, and it is a great one. ","9"
"Arrow",2013-03-02," this show literally is the reason i got my abs toned muscles of Stephen Amell with his superb acting skills and gr8t fighting sequences. superb story with regular surprises and thrilling! nothing more needed on a TV show. just the BeSt on Indian television at least !!! show has very engaging characters. past storyline sequences are quiet dark and some may even find it disturbing but it is worth it, even i would add that i enjoy it. Amell has worked very hard for his character and that reflects in the fighting scenes, he took special combat training for ARROW. finally, this show is the best show ever to be telecasted on Indian Television. thanks to star world!

"Arrow",2013-02-21," I've enjoyed DC for many years in all its mediums and the reprisal of the (Green) Arrow to the mainstream in Smallville was enjoyable despite the beautiful people aspect of the series. So I was expecting a lot from  The Arrow  especially when 2 of my favourite actors appeared in it, John Barrowman (Dr Who/Torchwood) and Manu Bennett (Spartacus). I was thinking  YES!!! So I've stuck it out for 15 episodes. Even when the soap level side plots and lazy scripting and dialogue have threatened to derail some pretty good action scenes and the main plot line itself. The cast has quality in it. Susanna Thompson who is rock solid in her role. Colin Donnell does well as the troubled son trying to find his way in life. John Barrowman is toothily good in his role as the Arrow/Queen family's nemesis. So I won't blame the acting for the stuttering character development, as I know what this cast is capable of. You can almost see the actors gritting their teeth having to use heavy handed cliché dialogue. I would point to the direction as a big problem though. For instance Paul Blackthorne's portrayal of Lance (another solid actor) came across as a case of psychotic schizophrenia.... Who am I he?  he cries...loving father or psychopathic cop that is quite happy to risk his only remaining daughter for a bust. To lose one would be careless to lose two? No wonder the poor guy is losing his hair. What can I say about Stephen Amell/Arrow, well he has an expressive suit(even though it is ill fitting especially for a billionaire). More than I can say for Stephen's acting. To be fair he does look the part, still that can only take you so far. The original DC Green Arrow was a bit of a wit and had a turn of phrase which is something a more expressive lead may have brought to the show. While the suit could certainly be saved by a visit to the tailor it might take more to save Stephen from looking so constipated all the time. The product placement in almost every episode has not enamoured me to the show either. Treating the viewer as an unthinking consumer that will digest anything put in front of them is patronizing and insulting, more so when it is done so blatantly. Since when does a tracking device that can be monitored on the internet require you to switch from an alleged state of the art smart phone (Lumia) to a notepad(Surface), a device that we know fits in every gals purse when they are at a dinner dance wearing not much more than a smile.Still 15 episodes in I'm still looking for it to become more than an extended advert for chewing gum. Will it get a second season? Probably but for all the wrong reasons. All this series needs is new writers,real direction and a miracle to raise it from mediocrity and sometimes outright embarrassment. Maybe it is time to start again.I would ask one question of IMDb how does this show merit an 8.2 rating? Seriously!!! ","3"
"Arrow",2013-02-18," But, why make a great thing instead another commercial product wrapped in another sheet. Sometimes I wonder what were the writers thinking when they came up with the story. He cheats his girlfriend with her sister and killed her in the process, and she's like, oh u cheated on me and killed my sister, i hate you, but hey what a heck,  bad things  happens, I care about you... Another couple that goes, i hate u, I love u, I reject you, I want you, I don't wanna see you ever, sorry I didn't mean that I wanna see you again: so often used and over used and abused in every movie, How I met y.m. Ted and Robin, Robin and Stinson, Suits, the Lawyer and the paralegal, Spiderman and the hot red chick, not to mention the every soap opera that is there.The teenager who can do anything and no one has power over her, who suffered for her brother missing and cannot enjoy the fact that he returned because she  suffered  not because she has an addiction. The importance the main character puts in the fact he has to look important but his expression is rather attention seeker not trauma. And he starts hunting important peoples right away and no one can link the attacks to his return, even the peoples targeted were somehow connected to his father. I guess they are all dumb and the show is targeted that way. A great idea with a bad script, dumb morality and uninspired dialogs. He talks to the funeral stone in his yard, even though he knows he buried his father on that island. How did his bow got back without anyone noticing or without security checking his locked chest ? ","5"
"Arrow",2013-02-17," I can't believe the incredible polarity of the reviews for this show! I was a huge comic book fan when I was younger (quite a few years ago, I admit) and Green Arrow was one of my heroes. I am loving this adaptation! OK, it's not 'Game of Thrones' as far as production / writing / acting values go, but it is damned entertaining and takes you along for a fun ride. Come on, you knockers, it's a COMIC BOOK for goodness sakes! Stephen Amell is a good choice for the lead and I personally think he's a good actor (check out his creepy performance in  Justice for Natalee Holloway), maybe dealing with less-than-riveting scripts (yes I agree, some of the dialogue is cheesy - but I stand by my 'entertaining' comment). Besides which, I applaud the priorities of the production crew, which have him bare his amazing physique at every opportunity (we women need a bit more eye candy!). Couple of negatives - not enough of the wonderful Colin Salmon, and what's with the green eyeshadow instead of a mask? This must surely be a bit of a nuisance when he's doing a quick change and I know he conceals his face wherever possible, but as a disguise it's pretty ineffectual (though I suppose nothing is as bad as Clark Kent/Superman's hairstyle/glasses transformation - was Lois Lane blind as a bat, lol)?! I'm also getting the vibe that it is going to evolve into more of a soap opera if the story lines keep up their current trend, instead of concentrating on the action - but we'll reserve judgement on that one. If you haven't already, give this show a go - if you're not expecting Shakespeare or BBC classical drama and just want to be entertained, this could be just what you're looking for! ","9"
"Arrow",2013-02-15," I have to say, in the first few episodes of this new show I was sceptical. I thought the way that Oliver was being treated when he returned after 5 years on an island, was somewhat unrealistic, and the acting wasn't that good.Now that I'm advancing through the episodes, my view has changed. I really like the story and after every episode I almost can't wait until the next one airs. There's always a great cliffhanger which makes me want to see the next episode. Also, the flashbacks he has to his time on the island are really cool. every time one of his flashbacks end, I wanna know more about what happened to him on that island. Conclusion:I got really involved in the story and with all the characters which makes me want to see more after each episode (Also, I really like bow and arrows). Definitely worth watching! ","8"
"Arrow",2013-02-14," As the summary tells you I found this show, after seeing 11 episodes, a big disappointment. The main characters have absolutely no chemistry with each other and their acting is just terrible in general. I found out that after a couple of episodes I thought there was something I missed. In the intro he tells us he  becomes something else . Now since I am not a big Arrow fan, or any comics in general, I thought there must have happened something that changed him into something else like with the Hulk. But no (at least not up to this point). But more important is that there isn't any indication that they will reveal something like that has happened. That is just one small example of how awful the story-writing is. In my opinion a show must have got some credibility. Like in other shows and movies we tend to believe that they can do those extraordinary things but up now they have failed to let me believe anything. Perhaps it is due to the acting, lack of chemistry or the thin storyline but I assume it is because all of those things together. The only thing that is actually good about the show are the action scenes. But since they failed to let me believe anything those aren't good enough to carry the show.all in all a terrible show and I don't expect any progress in the near future. ","1"
"Arrow",2013-02-12," So here is the thing; there isn't any real hero/vigilante shows on TV/internet these days. So this is the only superhero type of show out there at the moment. Now it has potential to be great! It really does. Everything about the show can work. The action, the playboy, the lost love. It works in favor of the show. However it has horrible acting. It has extremely cringeworthy acting. The beginning lines, every time Oliver busts a bad guy; 'You have failed this city!' I am sure Amell himself cringes every time he has to say that, Blackthorne himself and so on. Acting sucks. Story line not too bad. Only superhero TV series. Has potential to be great. I hope they do change it and make it better because it could really be a hit. It isn't a show you will cut your wrists for lets put it that way. That is why I am giving it a 7, that acting is pretty bad... ","6"
"Arrow",2013-02-07," I noticed the featured user review gives the lowest possible rating for Arrow, claiming it to be horrible without having even watched a full episode. If it's not already obvious, please learn to ignore trolls with no sense of reason.Like all good CW shows, Arrow builds with each new episode, becoming better, more engaging, more curious. There are a few filler episodes here and there, but unlike more conventional television, Arrow has two main stories that play out as the first season progresses. There is the present-day storyline, where we watch Queen do his vigilante thing, but we also get to see flashbacks to five years past, where, while stranded on an island inhabited by dangerous and mysterious hostiles, a younger Oliver is forged into a formidable warrior. There are mysteries being revealed in both present events as well as in the flashbacks, and at some point these mysteries will be explained, and possibly even intersect in some way. So far, this first season has weaved the narrative well, and created some fairly thick suspense that holds the viewers attention.Arrow works well by grounding itself in reality. There are no meta-humans to be seen, only normal people who have honed their skills to achieve great things. There are relationships and character development at work here that make the show interesting to watch regardless of the action. Saying this, however, the action is still what Arrow does best. Fights are fast and brutal, and really well choreographed. It's not just how the fights play out either, but who the players are, and the heroes and villains seen in the first season are all worth watching for.Give Arrow a try, maybe by watching an episode deeper into the first season. For a slow-burner, it's already burning with a fierce intensity, so we'll probably see it come into a league of its own by the end of this season. ","8"
"Arrow",2013-01-31," I started watching this show from day one and enjoyed it at first. It began strong, full of action and the story line seemed to be going in the right direction. However, soon after it started to feel more like a cheesy soap opera. The acting seemed forced and overdone. The current rating I think is an exaggeration based on the first few episodes. I have now stopped watching it because I can't afford to sit around and watch a show I no longer enjoy. I have also spoken to several other people who feel the same way. If this show still appeals to some people, that's great, but I'm certainly not one of them. Hopefully it will turn around but until then I'll be watching Californication :). ","6"
"Arrow",2013-01-27," If you're a fan of of super hero flicks, looking for a good action series or looking to pass some time then I'd highly recommend this. However if your expectations are high and you are looking for an intelligent show than you may find this show inadequate and instead of enjoying the show, you may just look for all the plot holes and clichéd characters. The plot is incredibly predictable but even so it does keep the viewer entertained. The best way to view this series is to not expect much (you may be disappointed) and enjoy the action series as it is without asking too many questions i.e. (How is this guy jumping around fighting people with guns just using a bow). The show does try make itself as believable as it can be but do not expect or even compare this to the batman trilogy even though it has some resemblances. To me the most interesting part of this TV Show and why I'm still watching is the flash backs to his time on the island which is incredibly interesting and we come to learn where his abilities came from. Throughout the episode we will see parts of what happened to him on the island that changed him and the plot is incredibly interesting. This and the action scenes are the truly saving grave of this show. Characters - Clichéd and annoying. I don't like the characters much, Green arrow is pretty much batman copy but worse, even then it's alright. The chemistry between the characters is incredibly annoying and the subplots of each individual character is quite uninteresting to me personally. The villains and super hero characters are alright and pretty traditional to what you would expect from a generic super hero flick. Plot - Average, the backstory of Green Arrow is really good but the main story is incredibly repetitive and you can predict what is going to happen next fairly easily.Action - Great, fight scenes every episode which look good.Summary - Watch this if you're looking to kill sometime, enjoy super hero based movies, and take the show for what it is. Most people will probably like this as it is fresh and entertaining despite the flaws which I outlined earlier. People who have a high expectation should try it out anyways, however it is likely you may be disappointed if your looking incredibly intelligent i.e. Breaking Bad. ","6"
"Arrow",2013-01-27," Arrow is a decent show that has a lot of potential if the film makers are willing to use it and not make another Smallville teen drama out of the show. A great deal of the show has no bearing on the original character, except for the name and the fact that he was on a deserted island for a length of time. Other than that, this is all a new storyline for Oliver Queen. The teen drama part brings the series down a bit. It is a superhero show, not Melrose Place and the gossip, arguing, girl friend swapping is all filler that has no bearing on the outcome of each episode or the character of Oliver Queen. It would be nice if that was cleaned up, but this looks like it is going to keep the teen drama for the younger audiences and keep this at an average show. ","6"
"Arrow",2013-01-23," Nice to see him again, huge farscape fan.This series is getting increasingly interesting, with the right amount of action (gotta love stealth and archery), intrigues, very hot women and a good crime/thriller stories with flashbacks and all. I also hoped to be able to see less of Amell half naked and more hood, maybe more Willa or Katie with less clothes could level the field a bit or else just leave the shirtless thing to twilight saga or other teen soap opera.There are several small stories running in parallel at any time: sister x drugs, ex x friend x hood, mothers role on the boat accident and other dark things, the island... so I see lots of potential, I just need there is someone with a clear head to direct this on a good path.For now I will keep watching and I hope it becomes a favorite for me. I recommend to all who like superhero/detective/crime, a bit in the line of Grimm, def. better than smallville kind. I hope they don't cancel it too early. ","9"
"Arrow",2013-01-23," Wow, talk about the most misrepresented show on television, Arrow purports to be an action/adventure show about a super-hero. In reality, it is as far from that as possible. The movie Annie has more action and adventure than Arrow.If this show has been recommended to you, then I hope you are a fan of melodrama. I call this show Arrow 90210. Taking out the commercials, you are left with about 35 mins of tiresomely boring melodrama between the relatives and friends of Arrow and about 5 mins of action. I was really excited to watch this show. I am a fan of the comic book and I liked the proposed changes to make the character more modern.When I saw the pilot I thought it was interesting. The whole subplot (no spoilers in this review) was intriguing and the show overall was interesting. I did find the central character a bit lacking in the acting department (is that guy a robot? Have they updated his emotional responses yet?) and the drama between the family and friends overly long and tiresome. I still thought it had potential.Much to my chagrin, the tiresome drama was quickly extended through each episode and the subplot and action downgraded accordingly. By the fourth episode, I was bored, I turned it off. I absolutely could not watch any further. I found that I didn't care at all about the feelings or relationships of the characters, and if the villain ever showed up (dont blink or you'll miss him) I was rooting for him to win. ","1"
"Arrow",2013-01-21," This back show is terrible. They have the  spoiled rich boy coming back to take vengeance on the evil rich friends of his parents  which plays well to the Obama-era class warfare, but little else.The core seems to be: If you got rich, you did evil to get there.Really? He can't fight crime, he has to be on this vendetta crusade? Plus there is the whole thing of the constant flashbacks to his life on the island brought in every episode. (Couldn't just tell us the back story in one episode?) This is such a disappointment after  Smallville  was brought to the network I had a hard time watching it.Bad scripts, bad plots and acting that would do 1966 William Shatner proud all top this off.

"Arrow",2013-01-18," Okay so I am not one to judge TV shows. It is not hard to please me when it comes to watching TV. I watch a drastic range from the walking dead to the mentalist to family guy. I absolutely adore superheroes and can not say enough about last year movies like the avengers, dark night rises and so on. So when I wasn't feeling well tonight and decided to stay home, I found the perfect opportunity to check out this new show. My sister recommended it and I saw the commercials. The guy looked hot, it looked full of action and seemed like a fun night. The last show she recommended to me was revolution and I was not disappointed. Hmm.. what she failed to mention is that no one in this show can act. The plot is not bad if looked at it overall but each episode is so boring. There is no chemistry what so ever. I had to force myself to watch eight episodes and I quit. I was about to go to sleep when I got angry. How the heck is this show doing well? Seriously, how is that good shows get canceled that actually have great characters, plot and directing and this peace of ++++ is actually getting acclaim. Am I missing something????? ","1"
"Arrow",2013-01-18," At first , i liked the show , i watched maybe 5-6 first episodes in a row because i really liked the idea of a superhero i don't know much about in a real life show.But the more i keep watching and the more the show feel like they are going short of superhero idea so they fill the show with family drama .So today i got episode 10 .. after 3-4 min i started skipping ahead because i was already really bored and all i could see coming is more drama , i was really disappointed by episode 9 , there was so much useless bad drama that i can only ask myself how a cameraman can film this without feeling the need to blow his brain out , i guess they hired some old lady's addicted to crying to bad soap show to film , direct and write the script .IMO this show is a mix between batman and dynasty , oliver queen should sign up for a name change to drama queen .

"Arrow",2013-01-17," I started watching this series wanting to know what the buzz was all about. 8.3 is rather high after all (imdb score at the time of writing this) and I had heard distant recommendations from a friend of a friend.I'll keep this short. The only logical explanation I can find to this series having such a high overall score must be because its connection to the comic, which I assume is of higher quality. I haven't read a page of it and quite frankly all my knowledge of the guy in the green hood previous to watching this series comes from The Big Bang Theory. I didn't even have any idea this was a TV adaptation of Green Arrow until they practically threw it in your face.It's a highly mediocre series with little interest to those who are not previously initiated in the canon. ","5"
"Arrow",2013-01-15," I was excited at first when I saw the pilot episode but gradually the allure faded as the story progressed, the acting by Stephen Amell acts as Green Arrow seems pretty lame and the way he walks and fights seems artificial to me. The dialogues seem to be a copy from Dark Knight Trilogy and there is no need for such.The best thing about him is that physique wise he looks perfect as Green Arrow.The actors also fail to make an impression.The only thing good about the show is the main story and the mystery of the island.Some characters just come and go without making an impression and the romantic and family relations part of the show is very boring and sucks out all the action. Although the latest was episode awesome and gave the story a new twist. I hope the show will improve as a whole when it returns on 16.1.13. ","6"
"Arrow",2013-01-11," Great series, but one remark. There are a few moments where Oliver speaks Russian. Guys, that's not Russian, believe me, it's my native language. If they hadn't warn, I'd never think they speak Russian. You know, more than one million people, who use Russian as first language at homes, is live in the USA and Canada, a lot of them in California, Washington <U+0097> not far from Hollywood and British Columbia. I wish producers could ask any of them how to correctly pronounce those ten words without sounding like chewing something. It would make the series more convincing.And that tradition to drink vodka at first meeting <U+0097> they are kidding you <U+0097> it never happens under such circumstances. Imagine, two Americans meet in Russia and drink up in honor of that a bottle of Coke, it sucks. ","8"
"Arrow",2013-01-11," hahahahhahahah! this is the most original thing i've seen in the past years! if only it were a comedy/parody ...thinking of it, actually it's funnier this way so nvm the comedy/parody statement.before i go on, i have to say that i've never read 'Green Arrow' but this is not the case here, at all.why it's funny? for starters, look at the review title. this series is actually a soap opera, everything about it is, well, with the exception that Green Arrow stars in it. the directing is horrid, so is the acting and the character lines. the story looks OK and i'd really like to know how it unravels. there's also hot women in it (not something one wouldn't expect). those last two facts are not enough for one to sit and watch it but they're the reason why i rated with 3/10 and not 1/10.what i will do, i propose you do the same, is start reading the 'Green Arrow' comic books and google for hot women instead of wasting my time watching this thing. it was really fun (hilarious tbh) watching the first couple of episodes (might be three, can't recall) but enough is enough.next! ","3"
"Arrow",2013-01-06," I understand the appeal of superhero/action comic stories. The good guys are purely good and noble and self-sacrificing and easy to pick out because they're really good looking, and we'd like to think of ourselves as those things, or potentially those things, if we could just get around to putting down the Doritos and remote and having a meaningful job and life. The bad guys are just as easy to pick out (though many of them are good looking, too, in this version of the oft-told tale). At some point, though, we grow up, and all this comic book ethos is revealed to be a ridiculous and childish take on a complex human world, where no one is purely good, and few are purely evil, but it's still appealing to some level of us that's still stuck in our childhood moral upbringing where Ma and Pop told us about right and wrong, and we still wish it were that simple and clear and that bullies got their comeuppance. Some people never grow up and see this sort of thing for what it is--wishful, simplistic thinking. Others know what it is, but find it appealing anyway; for the part of me that is such a person, a couple stars for doing a decent job of it in this show.This show is also full of extremely good looking people. Any heterosexual female is going to dampen her...er, palms watching this.The action scenes are uneven--some pretty good and interesting, and some fakey and in violation of the laws of physics. The present-day plots are utterly predictable, the resolutions simpleminded, as is the romance.The backstory scenes were interesting in the first few episodes but paled quickly. As of this writing, the show has gotten repetitive already.Minus three stars for immediate fake negative votes of the first version of this review, in case the show's makers paid for those, which is a sleazy practice.I watched all the shows said to be the best of the fall 2012 season for at least two eps each, and this is indeed one of the better ones. But it's not actually good. ","2"
"Arrow",2013-01-05," I'm not a fan of Comic Book heroes and wasn't even familiar with the character before I noticed the pilot listed on TV. I'm down to only two hours of television per week (I can't handle any more than that) and thought it might be nice to see something new. And it would be nice - if there ever was anything new.I made myself sit through the whole pilot, which, by today's standards equals about 40 minutes of programming and 20 minutes of commercials. Long before it was over I found myself asking a familiar question: Does it cost less to produce crap than it does to produce quality.Remember when the commercials during the Superbowl were all funny? Maybe some of you aren't that old but, believe me, it's true. They used to be funny. Why aren't all commercials funny? Does it cost less to produce stupid commercials? I wonder.TV shows used to be creative, technical, artistic and dramatic. A few of them still are. OK, maybe two of them still are. The rest are crap. Does it cost less to produce crap?I have to admit that my expectations of any new show aren't very high. But Arrow, like so many other shows today, fall so far short it's laughable. Let's not talk about the OH, COME ON! situations. Like, how does a guy come back from a 5 year absence to a lair set up and running with the latest computer technology waiting for his return. Think about how much technology has changed in the last 5 years. How does the hero's friend secure a venue for a party at the last minute that just happens to be right across the street from the bad guy's office? And how do people who can't act, can't write and can't direct get jobs in TV anyways? Is the golden age of television really gone? ","1"
"Arrow",2013-01-04," Not going to lie but I am a bit obsessed with this show, yet I'm not a fan of superhero based shows which is why I was hesitant at first about watching Arrow. After the first couple of episodes I couldn't stop watching, the drama, the plot, and the acting really drew me to the show. I would definitely recommend this to anyone, this is the type of show which should by on air more often. But I do have to say I still think they stretched out the show a bit too much meaning it took a bit longer for me to start really liking it then usually.P.S. Burned is the best episode...just saying :D ","10"
"Arrow",2012-12-26," I stopped watching this TV series only after 3 episodes! I did try my best.What is the problem? Stephen Amell as Oliver Queen is the BIG problem, he is simply not credible, not plausible at all in the role of this main character Green Arrow! He simply does not click at all with me. Oh yes, he has muscles and so on but I simply do not connect at all with the actor and his character! He is so emotionless that it is really very bad and painful to watch him in his role! So bad is his character and the awful acting by Stephen Amell that I had to stop watching this TV series.What's more? The stories with this TV series simply do not seem plausible at all either. That is probably a very big problem, for me at least! One of many examples? The scenes where the main character, with his bow and arrows, happens to unbelievably outclass someone with a gun!!!Actors matter and the way they act through their characters does matter a lot too. That is probably the lesson of this TV series. Muscles are not enough to make an actor good for a particular role requiring muscles and, more important, plausible, for this particular role.For instance, the actor Justin Hartley who played in Smallville Oliver Queen (a.k.a. as Green Arrow), he managed in Smallville to make such an unbelievable character perfectly believable. It is certainly a big achievement compared to the pathetic performance Stephen Amell as Oliver Queen produces in this TV series Arrow. That is where you see how an appropriate actor for the role does matter a lot but also the elements introduced in the TV series to make this particular character of Green Arrow believable are also very important. For instance, all the high tech gadgetry related to arrows that Green Arrow in Smallville used made his character believable, as he could reasonably be seen as having an edge against other competitors with say guns for instance. In this TV series Arrow, there are basically no elements that are presented for this particular character to make him truly believable, truly plausible in any way.Here are mostly TV series and a few movies that I highly recommend, as I watched them and enjoyed them a lot.--------------------------------------------------------There are a few classics in science-fiction TV series:---Smallville---Star Trek: Enterprise---Babylon 5---Earth: Final Conflict---Battlestar Galactica---Star Wars (6 movies so far and counting)---Jupiter Ascending (a movie)all deserving 15 out of 10 because they are all very special TV series for the quality of their stories and for the amazing actors that they have. Are these TV series perfect? No, as they sometimes have  filler  episodes that are not too great and they also sometimes have  holes , illogical elements in the main story or in the individual stories of particular episodes. Despite sometimes the presence of these very few shortcomings, these TV series are really unique and special in many ways that you will nevertheless enjoy them greatly.Other TV series that are excellent but not necessarily science-fiction? Here is my list of other excellent TV series that you will appreciate a lot:--A few more science-fiction:---Battlestar Galactica: Blood & Chrome (it is science-fiction)---Caprica (it is science-fiction)---Babylon 5: Thirdspace (it is science-fiction)---Space: Above and Beyond (it is science-fiction)---Defying Gravity (it is science-fiction)---The Tomorrow People (it is science-fiction)---The 100 (it is science-fiction)---Almost Human (it is science-fiction)--Non-science fiction:---24---24: Live Another Day---Dexter---The Vampire Diaries (it is fantasy I could call it)---Breaking Bad---Kyle XY (it is slightly science-fiction)---Nikita---Damages-------------------------------------------------------- ","4"
"Arrow",2012-11-11," This review is for people who watched the first 3 episodes, like myself ...Never read a comic about Green Arrow but i don't think its this bad. Maybe its because i just finished watching  The Sopranos , not sure ...Don't know where to start ... This show is very hardly believable, even for a superhero show. Queen was at the island for 5 years, learned two foreign languages, became hacker, scientist, martial art master, technician, bow master and probably lots of other stuff, best superhero need to have, yet to see ... He set up a lab, made all the gadgets, hacked into FBI, CIA, Interpol database, made a suit, alone, unseen, in a first few days ... Not to talk about stealing $40M from the bank account using only his arrow ... I mean WTF????This was all from the first episode. Shortly, its very bad show, can't believe it has 8.5 rating. Really? Its a disgrace for all the other great shows out there. By the way, I rated it 3 only because of Katie Cassidy.Maybe its only my opinion but I will not watch it in the future. ","3"
"Arrow",2012-11-11," Arrow! i watched the first episode out of curiosity but expected it to be cheesy over the top and disappointing..... I was very wrong! it is a cool entertaining action revenge series! The green arrow kicks ass and isn't afraid to kill to protect starling city! Add his bodyguard/Sidekick Diggle who adds some great scenes to an already impressive show! hope this show gets another series! 7 outta 10..... So far! Great show Good actors Some amazing action Watch this show Or arrow will find you and when he does he will kick your ass. Stephen amell is an awesome Green arrow By far better than justin hartley! No cheese with this steak haha ","10"
"Arrow",2012-11-10," Firstly watching the pilot had seemed to much like Chrispoher Nolan's Batman Begins which was off putting as it was like a cheesy copy of Batman Begins. The hero coming home and avenging his city with no pacing and rushed, the love interest working at a law firm that helps the weak and has great morals (how typical...) and the police being a big deal to the show but they have no character to them. All the characters have poor character introductions and development along with the cheesy acting from all the cast essentially the Green Arrow.The theme of Arrow is very confusing with the drama and setting at times darkish and then lighter and also trying to add humour towards it (which is working, sorry). The law firm and police station set seems like a daycare place for the kids and seriously  if you're trying to make it like the Nolan theme then sick to it and have gritty sets and better quality actors . Take a look at Vampire Diaries & Supernatual, they have a dark theme towards it and quality drama and acting which are also my favourite shows.The good part (and perhaps only) is the fight scenes to them. If they had spent as much consideration to the story and character as they did to the fights, then Arrow could reach its potential. And perhaps it's better than there newly CW shows like the horrible Beauty and the Beast and Emily Owens m.d. ","6"
"Arrow",2012-11-10," What is there to say? This site is filled with people who give this crap 9 or 10 for this garbage because they are invested into the program or are rating it on a scale that compares it with other garbage on TV.Yes in the world of garbage shows, Arrow is OK.In the world where I come from where you have Game of Thrones, Breaking Bad, Dexter, The Walking Dead and other 9/10, 10/10 shows, Arrow ranks as a 1.Please anyone who gave this crappy show a 9 or 10 please write how it stacks up against the shows I just mentioned....so we all can have a good laugh.

"Arrow",2012-11-09," When I first saw the previews for this film, I was very excited for a darker, vigilante type show. Well, it isn't as dark and thought provoking as I would have liked, but that was just my own expectations. You will NOT like this show if you are one of those people who needs everything to be realistic; but, if you are someone who doesn't mind having your brain  look the other direction  every now and then for the sake of realism and slightly cheesy acting and plot lines, then there is a decent chance you will like the show a lot. It is basically a combination of Robin Hood and Batman; the story line so far has some pretty good promise and I look forward to watching more episodes. But again, it is a CW production, not a major motion picture production, as long as you can keep that in mind, I think you will enjoy it a lot.Edit on 9/19/2014: This has actually turned out to be a fantastic show; one of the best on television. The characters are well developed and there are real consequences the good guys have to deal with; very good show! ","8"
"Arrow",2012-11-09," Based on the DC comic book character Green Arrow, the show is an adventure/action series developed by Greg Berlanti, Marc Guggenheim and Andrew Kreisberg.Billionaire playboy Oliver Queen (portrayed by the obscenely handsome Stephen Amell)returns home having spent the last five years stranded on an uncharted island to find his city in all manner of criminal disarray and wanton corruption. This will never do. And so, the once irresponsible lothario sets about on a campaign of righting the wrongs of the nefarious town that was once his playground, targeting the key miscreants that are responsible. Using a mixture of Parkour, practical martial arts and a exceptional talent for the bow and arrow - not to mention of course his limitless flow of disposable funds, he begins to target the shady figures he deems accountable and subjects them to some vigilante style justice.This show is great! The story is fantastic, and the layers are deep and plentiful - from the ongoing flashback sequences detailing Olivers time spent as a castaway to the clandestine figures and the obligatory love interest with whom he must redeem himself. The production values are incredible, the show runs at a breakneck pace and boredom would only be a problem for those suffering from the most crippling form of ADHD. The action is superbly choreographed - as indeed are the fight scenes that are indicative of our desire to see a more believable style of on screen fisticuffs. The tone of the show is rather camp, but that's to be expected, as is the acting but not to the degree of overkill. The first episode left me very eager to see the next and so much is set up within the first show - without becoming convoluted, that I couldn't wait to see how it all pans out. Such good fun - lighthearted yet dark in places, this shows appeal will stretch far beyond that of a comic nerd demographic and thankfully has been picked up for a full season. ","8"
"Arrow",2012-11-05," Most of the reviews I see are based on just the pilot, or pilot and ep2.After ep2 things start to be more explained by short flashbacks.I too wondered  How does surviving on an island make one good at teakwood?  So far, via the flashbacks it would seem he was trained by a scruffy Chinese who has been hiding from some black suited, masked, gun carrying men. Maybe smugglers? Terrorists? A fuller explanation will come in later episodes I'm sure. Although I have no idea how he would learn hacking without a computer, maybe he just buys his hacks.My main complaints is just that the show wastes too much time on him fixing his sister and poking around nightclubs with his friend.Pretty good but I would much rather have had a season3 of human target, it was much more creative in fights and felt more adventurous to me. ","7"
"Arrow",2012-11-04," ...this show is almost indescribably bad. It makes me angry just to think about.Caveat: I don't know a whole lot about Green Arrow. His name is Oliver Queen, he gained his skills while marooned on an island, he's rich, and he is SO EASY to make fun of. But this isn't an attack on the concept. I've seen sillier concepts work out to be much better shows.Arrow is one of those shows where wooden acting, poor directing, and writing about on par with the Twilight Saga come together to create one of the most offensive television experiences I have ever had. And I've seen Jersey Shore.Stephen Amell as the titular hero Green Arrow and Katie Cassidy as Laurel are particularly bad, with approximately one-and-a-half facial expressions between them and a penchant for removing themselves from the room as the standard method of showing anger. You could make a drinking game out of it, truly.The writing is staggeringly awful. However, when I say  writing,  I'm not speaking about the plot. That might yet unravel over time, but it's too early to tell. What I mean is the actual words which come out of people's mouths. There is a specific scene which comes to mind where Oliver and his best friend, Tommy, are seated at a table, discussing their friendship. Tommy reveals that he's been sleeping with Laurel, and Oliver's only reaction is,  That's okay, I forgive you.  I closed my eyes for this scene and realized that I could not even tell who was saying what at certain points. They have no verbal mannerisms, and the  funny  best friend has no real sense of humor that I could discern. Plus, his jokes plain suck, but I guess that's a minor point, all things considered. I should point out that, recently, a friend told me that Tommy Merlyn turns into Green Arrow's nemesis, which means they of course have a lot in common and might seem like the same person at times. But that doesn't really come across as purposeful on this show.The directing is maybe the worst offender, here, because a good director could turn cruddy actors and poor writing into something downright entertaining. Just look at Sam Raimi's work on Spider-man 1 and 2. Instead, I find myself imagining David Barrett or John Dahl or any number of the other directors on this show, sitting there texting while scenes are happening. Maybe eating a sandwich or something. Not paying attention must be hungry work.I'm getting into a lot of detail, so I'm just going to cut this off and say that I should have seen it coming. Just look at the promo picture. Really consider it. That was the very first thing we were shown regarding this series. Ask yourself what that says about their priorities. ","1"
"Arrow",2012-11-03," Tbh,this is just awesome. It has what 'smallville' lacked. though smallville was entertaining,it was slightly not as mature as i would want it to be. From the first episode where the green arrow killed his kidnapper,i knew this would be different. and it has not disappointed me yet. The story line,is awesome too.I love the characters,even thought the green arrow can be quite annoying sometimes. but if he was perfect,there wouldn't be much of a show would there. All in all,you should start watching this if you are a superhero flick fan and even if you are not. believe me,it will be worth it. From the creators of 'game of thrones' and 'smallville' this is a must watch. ","10"
"Arrow",2012-11-01," This has easily become my favorite action series EVER! Really good acting, good script, the main character, Oliver, is perfect. I used to be watching Smallville a lot, and I liked it. But then, I was taking it as a fantasy series and allowed the non-sense. In comparison, Arrow seems just so real. Its base line is very solid and elaborated. The action, the stunts are Hollywoods level. There is just enough humor to avoid boring the spectators but not to make it look like a parody. I see a great future for Stephen Amell. He's got an amazing physique as required by the part, but he doesn't come out for a second as a male doll. His presence is way more powerful. Hope this series go a lot of seasons! A real quality show. 20 stars out of 10! ","10"
"Arrow",2012-11-01," this show exceed my expection.when i watch the pilot i knew it was going to be interesting and so it does.the star cast is good and so is its story.its by bar the best show premiered this year.the show is to the mark.Stephen amell does a brilliant job portraying this guy who is on a mission. He switches brilliantly from being the angry and brutal  arrow  to the  before  partying billionaire playboy brilliantly which reminds me of Christian bale's performance in the batmen series.no chance that u may hate this show.hope they will continue in this mannerI totally enjoyed the first episode and i can't wait for more! - 10/10 ","10"
"Arrow",2012-11-01," Disappointing. I'm very surprised people rated this so highly. Very mediocre plot line for the pilot as far as  super-hero  stories go. Being stranded on an island somehow forges you into the ultimate fighting machine??? What did he have to fight on this deserted island?? I mite understand that he MITE become a good bowman...but that's leaning on the reasoning that he could build his own bow in the first place...and how in the world does that grant him extraordinary hand to hand combat skills? Was he training in judo with wild animals??? None of this makes sense and really it just left me a very hallow feeling for the main character. Good back story but the huge hole in how he became a super hero leaves me feeling very bland about the entire show. I think most super-hero fans will agree that HOW you become the super-hero is one of the most important parts of the story-line. This just feels like a very sad attempt at originality in my opinion. I'd be very sad to see a show like this get taken up for a second season when shows like The Cape got canceled before they even finished the first season. As far as the acting goes...it was just fine. Not a lot of room for depth in the main character so I can't praise the actor too much yet but I'll keep watching to see if it gets any better. There is NOTHING original about this show...I'm so confused about all this nonsense about this  cutting edge view  on a hero TV show. ","6"
"Arrow",2012-11-01," I'll be honest: I love the show. The show has a dark edge to it, which makes it very appealing. The plot is unbelievably well written, and it has enough humor for the occasional laugh. So, why do I say that I'm dissatisfied?I'd like to say that I'm a comic book reader. In case you weren't aware of it, this show is based on the DC comic book series, Green Arrow. I hardly read any DC comic books, so I can't say I'm very familiar with it. However, I watched Justice League when I was a child and Green Arrow happened to be my favorite. So when I got to hear that it was being developed into a dark show for the adult audience, I was thrilled. I had high expectations from it, which it didn't math completely.Firstly, the acting is often melodramatic. Cheesy, melodramatic acting is such an annoyance. Its shown mostly by the main female characters, i.e. Laurel, Oliver's Mom and Thea. Secondly, its plain dumb at times. The show puts on melodrama that is somewhat transparent, but shouldn't be put on anyway. How can Oliver such a strong grip on technology? He was abandoned on an island in the Pacific, not in New York of the 28th century. Oliver swinging through Starling City on a rope attached to an arrow shot from a bow? That would look totally awesome with Spider-Man (Seriously, think about it. Spider- Man with a red bow in his back and a red arrow in his hand. Sweet.) but not with Green Arrow. Even if he is at the peak of human capability, that is impossible and they should have acknowledged that. If these flaws weren't so distinctive, I wouldn't have hesitated in giving a show a 9/10. I hope that the nuisances that I pointed out will be fixed, if not in this season then in the next. ","7"
"Arrow",2012-10-30," If you are looking to seeing a terrific superhero TV serial every week, then arrow is a MUST-see for you. One might argue that this idea has been taken from robin hood/batman but the direction and acting makes it a unique experience! I would put this series right in the ranks of TV series likes of Game of thrones, Walking Dead & Dexter etc. The script writer has skill fully kept many things hidden and open and releasing them slowly and makes the audience hungry for more. Bottomline is, see a couple of episodes. If you have ever liked any super hero movie/comic/cartoon in the past, chances are you will cling to this series very strongly. ","10"
"Arrow",2012-10-30," First off let's be honest, this is a replacement for the long running Smallville. That being said... I like this series better all ready, it has better action ( a little park-our here and there, which is awesome) Katie Cassidy ;) and of course the Luther mansion from Smallville and X2 doubling here as the Queen mansion, and the actors do a great job. I just hope the series doesn't get get to formulaic as the weeks go on. I hope they can evolve the series to incorporate some bigger story arcs, I'm not too current on the Green Arrow comics but I am enjoying the island flashbacks... it's that part of the series I look forward to seeing every week! WHO OR WHAT WAS ON THAT ISLAND WITH OLIVER AND THE Asian DUDE!Overall a solid option on Wednesday night. ","8"
"Arrow",2012-10-25," I like the movie, especially the idea of rich robin hood in the city, it's new and has a fresh approach. I like how action scenes are filmed and presented, the story-line and the way it is presented the hero's life : now and then (on the island). Nice movie, actors and plot! It;s nice that he has his father list with people that he wants to hunt and i like the connection between him, his girlfriend and the girlfriend's father (both working under law). I also like that he is not the person who was before going on that island but acts as he is the same guy. It's a bit strange that after 5 years on the island he knows everything about computers and software but i am sure the next episodes will present also this explanation. ","10"
"Arrow",2012-10-24," As for who I am, I started reading/collecting comics in the early 80's, my collection growing both forward and backward, and spending most of my adolescence hanging out at the local shop. With most of the characters that have seen either screen lately having 50-75 years of history behind them, I've learned to separate the  fanboy  and the viewer in me to avoid picking apart every detail, so i can enjoy the TV show/movie for what it is.This wasn't really necessary here, as Green Arrow isn't a very far-fetched character, and more grounded in reality. Plus, they've remained true to his origin, although at time of writing, only two episodes have aired (I never judge a series by the pilot).After CW's success with Smallville, I was fairly certain they'd have another DC comics series in the works; and when I found out it was (Green) Arrow, I was happy, but slightly disappointed Justin Hartley wouldn't be reprising the role (mostly because he'd become the face associated with it).But once I saw the previews, I knew  pretty boy  Hartley had no business being on the show since they were going with the darker, grittier aspect of the character. Unlike other superheroes, Green Arrow isn't driven by a need for vengeance, or a moral compass; but more of a (sometimes border-line self-abusive) obsession with vindicating himself for continual shortcomings or mistakes in both of his identities, be they real, or simply a matter of his own perception.With action scenes that re-enforce the fact he's not just a sniper with a bow, but also showcase Green Arrow's stealth, agility, and hand-to-hand expertise (as well as a few quick winks to the comic book fans already) I'm hoping the series stays around for a while, but the ratings will decide if  Arrow  has enough  green  to go.

"Arrow",2012-10-24," I'll be honest, as soon as I heard about this show, especially how about it would be  dark and gritty , I felt I wouldn't like it. However, two friend of mine recommended it, so I watched the first episode.I'm giving it three out of ten because the cameraman had the camera turned on and pointed in the right direction during filming, the scenes located in a castle were actually filmed in a castle, the costume department had provided some costumes and the actors weren't actually reading from scripts during the scenes. But everything else? Waste of time I know that the biographies of Green Arrow and Batman share some similarities, but this simply lifts a good portion of the plot of batman begins, re names a few characters and places and packages it up in 42 minute installments.No-one in the cast stands out, they've gone to the same pool of TV/ soap opera actors you've seen in half a dozen shows already. They're generic looking actors (for example, the actor playing  arrow , I can only imagine the casting call described him as  Christian Bale/ Chris O Donnell but cheaper ), which wouldn't be so bad if the script gave them any chance to shine, but it doesn't - it's just thoroughly mediocre. At one point someone says the line  I guess starling city has a new guardian angel , always be wary when a writer has a character say this, it mean they're not sure they've managed to convey that through the plot, which is sort of the point of the plot.Speaking of the actor, Stepehn Amell, I guess he watched the dark knight trilogy, and decided that portraying a multi faceted character with layers to his personality, who's hiding a dark and sinister nature mainly involves scowling a lot. there's a reason Christian Bale is paid a lot of money to scowl in movies; he knows how to do it well. This guy? not so much.Long story short, if you liked  Smallville  maybe you'll enjoy this. But for all it's pretension for being a dark and gritty adult drama, this is aimed squarely at angsty teens who'll buy iPhones because they see them in this show. If you want to watch an engaging character based drama about a DC comics superhero, watch Batman: The Animated Series from the nineties, because honestly, the animated characters in that seem more human ","3"
"Arrow",2012-10-23," Really? That high a rating? This show is TERRIBLE and I watch a lot TV, as much as humanly possible, including some really-bad-but-good shows. I could NOT watch this show, I watched the first 20minutes and me and my friend had to turn it off it was so painfully terrible.The cinematographer is alright, the effects are alright, but the characters are plastic dolls and the writing is so incredibly wrong for the scenario. The main character is supposed to appear stoic, but instead he just seems like his brain has been broken, robotic-idiotic.Don't bother. ","1"
"Arrow",2012-10-21," Have to say this Arrow Series is really pretty good i started to watch it by accident trust me its pretty interesting and makes me very curious to watch the next Now talking about this series a very unique one from the rest of the series i have watched the acting of Stephen Amell is pretty good and i really look forward to watch him in the big films soon and its the best superhero series i have seen so far i really hope they make an another seasons and also they could increase the length of the each series to 52min rather than to 24min then it would be good to watch but overall i give it an 10/10 stars ","10"
"Arrow",2012-10-21," In minutes I could tell I liked the style of this show. An to my surprise they got good actors too! I pick shows apart and I'm sure I'll do the same to this show BUT I was so captivated by the first 2 episodes I am promoting this show to everyone I know to check it out. Great job! Lets hope enough of us watch it to make it profitable enough to keep on the air.Likes:1. Over all look and feel of the picture. ( does it help I like green? ). 2. It's not too slow building up characters. They don't try to feed you a huge background story to explain the character to everyone. You get a little here, a little there. And not too slow too where it seems they edited out a scene that would explain it better ( like Prometheus...). 3. The actors sell their roles. Not all are equally good but good enough for great entertainment. Dislikes:1. I would have expected a certain character to be already dead...but a little variation from the comic is working so far. 2. Ever see UHF with Weird Al where he makes fun of Rambo? He is 4 feet away from an enemy with an automatic weapon firing constantly yet he misses every time...then when Rambo (Al) shoots back they explode. Ya...it wasn't that bad but I think it's a little far fetched at times (it is TV...but too far fetched). ","10"
"Arrow",2012-10-21," The buildup to a change from a licentious rich kid to a heroic vigilante was very poorly written. The character is not believable in the least: a guy spends 5 years on a deserted island struggling for survival, yet finds enough time and resources to learn martial arts, a foreign language and acrobatics? come on... Not to mention that he somehow managed to manufacture electronically enhanced arrows and become a hacker. You call that believable? really? Besides, he wants to be a good guy and  save the city , so he starts by physically attacking his bodyguard and killing people who's only visible crime is working for a mobster. Some good values there, no doubt.The other characters are not much better, each of them is a stereotype of some kind, not a rounded, complicated human being. In almost every single respect the first episode was one of the worst TV shows I've ever seen. i will not watch the second episode. Honestly, I wish I could unwatch the first one. ","1"
"Arrow",2012-10-20," I've started to watch it without expectations, i didn't know anything about green arrow when i was watching the first episode.I have to say that there are gapes in first episode, you can say ; this is not a movie its the first part of a TV series, yes but its not OK for me and there is no way to explain it without giving spoilers.It has a good scenario (but not great) and its penetration to the scene looks like having some problems. As far as i am concerned, the main character lacks of confidence and couldn't manage to give us the feeling, the soul of a super hero, so his tricks,moves look like epic fail in most scenes. The other characters performance is not bad. There is not much to say about music, it could be better So, in conclusion ; it could be a really epic TV series but for now, its just OK, you can watch it or not, its up to your opinion about how valuable your time is.

"Arrow",2012-10-19," I am no comic book fan or even reader, so I can not compare this show to the original series and how faithful the show is to the comic book itself. But I will weigh in on how the show is and felt and what are its cons and pros.I am even not familiar with the Green Arrow character until only recently and I have viewed the pilot episode yesterday not expecting what the story is actually about. I knew it was a comic book adaptation and the show talks about a rise of a superhero.The pilot is entertaining with good action scenes and when the show was over it left me wanting to know what happens next, which is always a good thing and the show itself felt a bit gritty which is also a good thing.But what I had an issue with is the show's pilot story, they just, like Ironman and Batman, showed us a guy with a lot of money   a billionaire  coming back to get some baddies for revenge and also bring some justice!If only they have dedicated at least a couple of episodes on how he reached the island and coped and lived on the island instead of showing us flashback,s would have been really nice and would have given a  real  feel to the show.The lead actor as Arrow was not a bad choice but not that great too. The action as I said is good, the supporting cast role I thought was above average but still kept the show entertaining. So action camera shots were great, like how the camera was behind his shoulder when he was jumping off the walls, I hope they stick to it in some other scenes.For me to keep watching this, just like another reviewer said,  it is an uphill battle from here . They must improve on the story, develop it gradually and show character development for all supporting actors and keep action scenes across all episodes. Only than this would be a great show. ","7"
"Arrow",2012-10-19," ...what the hell happened on that island. If you're hooked after watching the pilot and you're anxious for it to continue, then you know this is a keeper. I was pleasantly surprised by this dark and more realistic approach, maybe a bit like Nolans batman franchise. I don't know the comics so can't really tell how close it is, but it works for me. The pilot offered quite some tension and didn't reveal too much at once, yet enough to catch your interest.The main character is charismatic an believable, though being a vigilante who's dropping quite some bodies I found myself really liking this deeply troubled and damaged guy. I think there's quite some potential here for some very interesting storytelling. The supporting cast works well too, some are too cliché but let's just give the writers more time to develop them properly. My only real complaint so far has to be that our hero dodges way too many bullets without getting seriously hurt, I hope they'll move away from that and keep it a bit more realistic.Apart from that I think this is the best new show of fall 2012 with a lot of potential and few issues. I hope the writers keep things interesting and flesh out the characters some more, but this show definitely got my attention and is worth watching. ","9"
"Arrow",2012-10-18," The writing for this series is beyond simplistic, and is heavy handed- which coincidentally aligns perfectly with the amateurish direction and phenomenally bad acting. David Ramsey puts in the best performances, which should speak volumes about the stink quality of the other actors. The CGI quality is laughable- video games have better effects for Pete's sake. The editing of the fight sequences at times look as if a live actor is fighting a blue screen and the foes are edited in later, and rather poorly at that. Then it looks as if frames are removed to make the action appear faster; The result is the  Arrow  is fighting a bit out of phase with the other combatants, and the action looks choppy as well. Two episodes in, and I can't imagine this hopeless dreck surviving a complete season- even on a two-bit channel like the CW. ","1"
"Arrow",2012-10-18," I enjoy comic book/super hero type shows when done correctly. The most recent few Batman's were done well. As was Watchmen, Kickass, and some of the newer X-Men series.This show has potential to be good, but I was turned off by the pilot episode. The idea is good. The storyline, though a bit close in the footsteps of Batman is decent. However, the casting and some of the afterFX take away from a better story.The music in each scene is too much and creates a cheesy flavor. The dramatic presentation is almost too polished and expected. The cast lack believability. I realize it is based on a comic book, but it feels dumbed down a bit. It should leave the adolescent audience behind and aim for the mature comic book buying masses of the 80's. This generation may prefer maturity to the genre they loved growing up.In order for this show to work it needs to be darkened up a bit. Allow the cast to get dirty instead of trying to be runway ready in every scene. The lines are very scripted and predictable. Develop some character from the individuals instead of stereotypes.I've only seen one episode, and still think potential is there, but if it continued on in the same beat as the pilot, I won't make it past the 3rd episode. ","5"
"Arrow",2012-10-18," I'll preface this review by stating that for all of it's warts, there is real potential here. The action is top notch. The male lead is charismatic, nuanced, athletic and completely believable in his role. The  weekly villains  are sufficiently evil, well connected and staffed with just enough bad guys to make the hero's journey to save his  Gotham  tough and interesting.The big problem is that the writers expended all of their subtlety on the main character and made every single supporting character one-note. The little sister is never allowed to be anything other than bratty. The ex-girlfriend is never allowed to be anything other than self-righteous. The detective considers everyone with money an enemy of the people. The best friend is never allowed to be anything other than a smug troublemaker. And all of them are placed in situations where they only serve to harass the main character and ultimately I can't wait for their tedious scenes to be over, which is a shame since they seem to be capable actors.I can't help but wonder if context is the issue here. After all, this is a show written for the CW and the demographic is mainly teen girls. For sure, at times, this feels more like a teen drama than action series.You have to wonder how much better this could have been if it had been written for the SyFy network. ","5"
"Arrow",2012-10-17," Of the new CW shows this fall, this vigilante batman style action hero drama has some potential to last. Fills a gap left for Smallville fans.Stephen Amell plays the titular hero who returns from being shipwrecked on an island for 5 years to right some wrongs in the city. They make him look a bit too scruffy. Katie Cassidy as his love interest looks more serious as a brunette. Nice to see her on a TV show though she isn't the most convincing lawyer. Colin Donnell plays his best friend. Also good to have Willa Holland (from the O.C.) as the younger sister on TV again.Couple of faults.Some of the dialog is a bit banal and isn't cleverly written. Can see some of the characters as trending towards low brow cardboard cutouts.I can kind of see the arrow shooting getting a bit repetitive. Can't be as fast as a gun. How come its so hard for any of the bullets to hit him? So far Nikita is still my top action show on TV. ","7"
"Arrow",2012-10-17," I have no idea where are all these amazing reviews are coming from, I fell from them and watched the first episode, which is totally crap. Its a poorly made soap - with long stares and bad acting. the characters are fake, and the plot is a total rip off. My best guess is that the writers of these reviews are the  actors , their family and friends who are posting fake reviews. Do not watch this show - I want my wasted time back!I have no idea where are all these amazing reviews are coming from, I fell from them and watched the first episode, which is totally crap.

"Arrow",2012-10-10," A young billionaire returns to his dark city after numerous years. During that time, he trained to become a superhero. Now, returning, he decides to fight off corruption and villains. However, he still has to maintain an identity as, frankly, a spoiled brat.Sound familiar? It is.Arrow is the new CW show about comic book hero and fan favourite Green Arrow. After being shipwrecked, Oliver 'Ollie' Queen decides to train himself and become a better person. In the comics, he decides to fight off various villains. In this show...he decides to become a murderer.Yes, I found it quite hard to identify or sympathize with this character. Unlike Batman, this 'hero' flat-out kills his enemies, most of whom have so far been bodyguards or unscrupulous businessmen, and has stated he has a hit-list of corrupt people he wants to take out.Further similarities are created with his love interest, a snubbed woman with a vague job that apparently involves helping people, much like Rachel Dawes of the Christopher Nolan Batman movies. So far, both characters feel the same - items for the hero to attain and defend.The editing throughout this pilot was terrible. By inter-splicing the backstory, a coherent feel could've been attained - however, this was not the case. Random moments of him in a lifeboat every 10 minutes leave you confused, especially since it hasn't been explained how he's attained his skills. The action is well-directed, but overtly violent. In an attempt to distance itself from the fantasy of comic books, this show went into dangerously dark territory and it lost me.The character of Oliver is confusing at best - the distinction between his playboy lifestyle and his inner turmoil is blurred, giving him the feel of an angry teenager who wants to lash out at the world. The other characters are stereotypical at best - his serious, black bodyguard; his womanizing, sex-obsessed friend; and his sister who is angry and rebellious, but clearly spoiled rotten.The show does have a few pluses - Green Arrow's costume is extremely sleek and well- designed, the stunts are well-done, and the set pieces are well-done.However, similarities between its influence ruin this show. The show feels more like a darker rehash of the Dark Knight trilogy than its own project - and, in this, is where it ultimately fails.I will continue to watch this show, in hopes that it gets better - to make your own opinion, you should as well. It's worth a watch, at least. ","5"
