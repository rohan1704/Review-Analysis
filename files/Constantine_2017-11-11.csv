"Constantine",2017-07-21," For me personally, in my opinion Constantine is the best TV series , the pilot was cohesive, concentrated and left me curious for more , Being a fan of the character for a long time, I have greater hopes for the show knowing the Newcatle Crew and Astra are there and Zed will become part of the show I'm very eager to see what's going to happen through the rest of the series and I know we'll get there, ","10"
"Constantine",2017-07-07," Loved this series. Cannot believe it's not been picked up for more seasons. Great characters, great pace. Matt Ryan's portrayal is spot on. Stumbled on this due to his appearance in Arrow and it's a gem. With more seasons I'm sure it will only get even better as the plot themes and characters develop. Come on networks!! ","10"
"Constantine",2017-06-17," For me this show is best ever from DC! Matt Ryan is amazing actor, his voice in this show is perfect for this character. His style and sarcasm is bloody amazing! Every actor in this show did AMAZING job. I watched this show 5 times and never get's boring. This show have so much details and wonderful story. 1 episode is best. I can easily say probably best show ever for me. If you love Demon stuff this show is for you! Cheers ","10"
"Constantine",2017-04-30," 'Constantine' brilliantly combines spell casting, occult, and humour. John Constantine is one of the most flawed & damaged characters ever. He has a painful and depressing past, and walks the Earth knowing he's going straight to hell when he dies. Yet, he still finds the courage to battle evil, crack a joke, and support the side that rejected him. Through all of the emotional turmoil he must go through, he still manages to live his life as an exorcist, a gruesome, terrifying, and extremely high pressure line of work. John's daily experiences would drive an average person insane with haunting memories. John has no superpowers, he just is an expert at dark rituals, and wages war against demons. The show balances John's humour, pain, and also has quite a few very frightening scenes that accurately capture what life as an exorcist might be like. John Constantine, despite his past, is the kind of man who is brave enough to scam the Devil, blackmail God, and still make you laugh. He could walk to hell and back unshaken. He's been face to face with demons, and he's been face to face with angels. This show ranges from dark voodoo rituals, to white robed angels with long flowing red hair and beautiful white feathered wings. Overall, the show is very intense, often scary, sometimes uplifting, and will have you on the edge of your seat. I would really love it if a channel picked this show up again, Constantine deserves a season 2. If you ask me it deserves more seasons than any other DC television series.9.4/10 ","9"
"Constantine",2017-03-21," I miss Constantine because of it's originality - Constantine is the ORIGINAL grim demon hunter ! Supernatural is good too in it's own kind of way - basically to see if Sam and Dean will get to live to see the next episode. I hope after Supernatural's 13th season (when it was promised to end) Constantine comes back ! Otherwise there will be a big hole in the level of demon hunters... ","10"
"Constantine",2017-02-20," I love this series. The only thing that was missing was more background of characters, spells/magic, etc. I feel a lot of explanation was missing... were the writers  hurried?  Or, perhaps much was lost in editing. At any rate, the shows concept and actors were absolutely fantastic, especially Matt Ryan! I hope the series is picked up by another network and given more attention & I don't mean an animated version... I would love to see this same series, with the exact same actors. Perhaps new writers and/or editors, budget increase, director, etc, would make the show exactly what it should be? I don't know the answer but, this series concept & it's actors are far to good to just let it fade away or turn it into an animated show. ","10"
"Constantine",2017-02-08," It saddens me a show as cool as this has hiccups getting released to season 2 and beyond. At first you get a punch in the face by this jerked off British guy with his hair colored blonde being Constantine, and after being a really big fan of Keanu's Constantine (well..Lawrence's actually) i was seriously like what in the f is this sh*t...but i kept on and i fell in love with it...Matt Ryan played an amazing role.If you guys love the god/heaven/hell/Satan/magic/exorcism/witchcraft theme don't pass out on this one. Its a gem. Unfortunately i guess it didn't hook a wider audience so its future might be questionable. shame ","10"
"Constantine",2017-01-13," A man struggling with his faith is haunted by the sins of his past but is suddenly thrust into the role of defending humanity from the gathering forces of darkness. Just finished watching Constantine and although it wasn't perfect i still enjoyed it a lot and the way it ends totally promised us a Season 2 but unfortunately that never happened although we are getting an animated version of the show. Now let me start with the stuff i did liked which is Matt Ryan as John Constantine which i think he did a really good job, also Angélica Celaya and Charles Halford were very good too. As for the villains i think that Michael James Shaw as Papa Midnite showed up in very weird places and episodes which kinda ruined the moment for me and don't get me wrong the man did a good job and then we have Harold Perrineau (Sabotage, The Edge) as Manny who spends 11 out of the 13 episodes of the entire season doing absolutely nothing except talking but he did have 2 really cool scenes but that season finale i don't know i just did not like the twist that much. As for my favorite episodes i think episode 6 was the best because it reminded me a lot of The Omen, Episodes 7,8 and 9 were also very great as for the rest of the episodes they were good but with both their ups and downs. Now let me start with the flaws like i said Manny does absolutely nothing for like the whole season except 2 major scenes where he saves the team but also a very funny sequence in the Hospital and the big twist in the end was pretty shocking to say the least, some of the cgi were pretty bad at times especially in Episode 1, certain demons in a couple of episodes were laughable especially the one who possessed other people and made them eat to death, there was also a scene where Constantine leaves his jacket in a house and he leaves without actually taking it at all and after he leaves his room in the hotel he wears it again with no reason and i know it's just science fiction but common really? The first 5 episodes were also kinda slow but after that it does pick up really good. I was also surprised by how much blood there's in this show i mean it's pretty hardcore at times and it totally has a very different feeling than Arrow, Supergirl, Flash, Legends of Tomorrow and even Vixen and i enjoyed that but i have to point out that at times there's some stupid jump scares that really bugged me. But overall  Constantine  is a great show that for sure it's not perfect but it totally deserved a Season 2 and i'm gonna give it an 9/10. ","9"
"Constantine",2016-12-27," What is going on with retreading all-to-similar story lines?  Wentworth  for  Orange is the New Black  and now this. Well, not that uncommon of a money making practice I guess. Sure is a non-creative, and cheap way to make some money. 1. Lucifer is back and still looks the same. You would think that Satan and pals with all their powers would have better things to do than perform cheap childish tricks on humanity. 2. The prop fake wings were so cheap they didn't bother to do the CGI of flying (or supposed flying) instead our archangel just does scene cut-and-paste appearances. 3. Unimaginative & tiresomely cheap (and fortunately quickly over ) levitating of whatever; usual time stop effects of things suspended; window glass shattering when evil does it's tricks; the old flying books off shelves. 4. Contact lenses everywhere as a cheap sign of other worldliness or just bad asses in a bad mood. 5. Parallel dimensions mentioned for some unknown reason - at least they didn't try to show some. 6. Suddenly appearing gaping holes in the ground (also cheap CGI) to gobble things up - how original. Yawn! 7. Demon growls for sound effects to create evil-is-coming mood. How do we know demons growl? Do they have vocal cords? 8. Lots of 19th century artifacts to indicate we've been fighting evil, well since the 19th century, but not for millions of years prior. Lots of drawing pointy things on floors and walls.Of course, chanting weird phases, and tossing special water on things. Satan et al. you're not so tough after all.9. Predictable writing hooks of disheveled, slightly dysfunctional male lead with stable (and attractive) female showing up to keep things in balance (and a little implied sex). 10. Bland, basically TV show experienced, acting. ","2"
"Constantine",2016-09-23," Another week, another comic book TV series. CONSTANTINE was a 13-episode series that was ignobly cancelled after just one series and it's based on the Hellblazer comic, just as the Keanu Reeves big screen adaptation of the same character was. This is distinctive and stylish enough to stand on its own right, although truth be told it's simply another monster-of-the-week show.I wasn't too taken with Matt Ryan's acting as the lead character. I found him arrogant, unfunny, and self-centred, and his British accent particularly annoying which is weird when I'm British myself. Still, the show has much in common with other successes like ARROW, so it's weird that it was cancelled. It's very fast paced and there's plentiful action in each of the episodes. It does feel very clichéd throughout without bringing anything really new to the screen but at the same time it keeps your attention so it's never dull.CONSTANTINE makes frequent use of a CGI effects budget to bring some impressive creations to the small screen. It's refreshingly gruesome in places and the various demons are well realised and well designed, coming across as genuinely scary on occasion. Some of the guest actors give performances that can best be described as hokey but overall the series makes for light and engaging viewing. ","6"
"Constantine",2015-11-09," This is amazing show, and it is very worth watching, the only problem is... It got canceled, please give him another chance, CW can boost it up, John Constantine was on Arrow few days back, now arrow fans are introduced to Hellblazer, so please, show some support and help to get it back on airing. I would be more then happy to help somehow, if i knew only some way, i would ask Matt Ryan, but he is an actor and all, so i doubt he would even reply me. :P So if anyone knows any way of helping get this show back on track it would be more then awesome, it would be glorious...... ''My name's John Constantine. I'm not the nicest bloke you've ever met. But i do me best!'' :'( ","10"
"Constantine",2015-11-07," I watched 1 episode of this show and it was the most terrible thing I have ever seen in my life. The movie was amazing and awesome they chose the perfect roles and I have watched the movie about 8 times. The new show is terrible, in the movie papa midnite had a perfect actor but now they have another actor that is horrible. No Gabriel no nothing good if I were you if you loved the movie do NOT watch this terrible show.They have a blonde austrailian constantine that does not wear black trench coat but he wears a regular trench coat. The movie is just so good constantine looks amazing in character in the movie. Even the demons look bad in cgi at least in the movie they had animatronics that looked cool and real and they were called  scavengers  not regular demons all the time. I would put zero stars if I could but I cant do that either. 0/10 rating for the show ","1"

"Constantine",2015-10-27," All I knew about Constantine before this series was the movie from 2005. I really liked the movie, so I was a bit skeptic about the series. But when I started watching I was blown away. The Constantine character were better, the story was better and there were more spells then the movie. I am a supernatural fan and have watched all supernatural. But this is the holy grail of fantasy! This is the series I have wanted and been waiting for for years! When I found out the series didn't go on after the first season I almost cried! The series is PERFECT and I hope someone will continue it someday! Everything from storyline, characters to the rules of the world are amazing! Please continue the Constantine series someone!! ","10"
"Constantine",2015-08-26," I thoroughly loved the whole concept, direction and portrayal and found the series very enjoyable. I appreciate that some of the acting and sets were a little bit suspect but this did not detract from the entertainment. On the whole the story lines were believable within the constraints of the plots and rarely strayed from these parameters. It was very much akin to the well read and well loved, by my generation, Duke De Richelieu novels by Dennis Wheatley and just as thought provoking, intriguing and addictive. My only major concern is I can find no hint of a second, third, fourth, fifth etc. Yet everyone of my peers who have watched it are surprised there is no immediate hope of a follow up. It begs the question, Why is their no follow up series? ","9"
"Constantine",2015-08-07," I was always into DC/Vertigo comic books, because they contained a really dark element. John Constantine is my favourite anti-hero. He is so cool and bad ass. I think that Matt Ryan was the most suitable actor for this role and portrayed John Constantine a lot better than Keanu Reeves in the 2005 homonymous film. The show shouldn't have been cancelled. It was extremely underrated. It is one of the best comic book adaptations I have ever seen. A lot of the story lines in the comic books are used in the series (slightly changed of course), as well as characters such as Zed and Chas. The opening theme of the series was a masterpiece. It summed up the atmosphere of the show. You could say that I am not objective since I have said that I love the Hellblazer comic book series. So I am going to stick to my points giving specific examples and analyzing my statements.Acting/Characters: I would like to start by analyzing the character of the notorious exorcist, demonoligist and master of dark arts John Constantine. He is a man forced to live every single day carrying the burden of his decisions, the people he hurt and the souls he doomed to hell along with his. He has a good soul really, but is not trustworthy. He is literally the only person standing between us and hell. He has made his choice: He is going to save mankind no matter the cost. Well, quite the hero right? Hmmm, not really. It is actually the people he is trying to save most likely to pay the prize of his impulsive actions. He has good intentions, but, in order to attain his often misunderstood goals, he hurts people and becomes manipulated by the dark forces he is trying to beat. He has also plenty of inner demons to fight and, to be honest, he is better at fighting those from the underworld. He is a complex character and Matt Ryan is cut out for this role. Zed is one of my favourite female characters in comics. A phychic artist that was instantly attracted to John. There is a deeper relationship between them, both mental and physical. In the series only the former is portrayed. I don't think this affects the whole connection between them and it is possible that if the show hadn't been cancelled, we would have seen it. Zed has secrets that we didn't have time to explore in the series, but in the comic books are pretty socking. Anyway, I can say that from all the comic book adaptations on TV in the year of 2014, Constantine was certainly the most accurate one which enlarged its fan base, but had a different storyline that enabled it to unfold in a whole new way. I was surprised and excited that it turned out better than I ever expected.Hellblazer Revived: The 2005 Constantine movie with Keanu Reeves was treated with mixed views, mostly bad. I am usually not influenced by people's opinions and I always form mine, but in this case I couldn't agree more. I liked the concept of the movie, which was inspired by one of the comic book story lines, but I was kind of disappointed with the portrayal of the main character, John Consantine. I am not saying that Keanu Reeves' performance was bad, but he was not really the ideal candidate. I think he is really charming with his persona and I enjoyed his acting in the Matrix, but he doesn't have this... I can't name it but Hellblazer's fans will surely understand. First of all, John Constantine is an English man and it is emphasized throughout he comic books. With his trench coat, his bloody cigarettes and his manners with other  mates , and his radical ideas about the Queen and society. he reflects a representative specimen of the English population. Matt Ryan is Welsh (close enough). However, the years have changed and some topics that were covered in the comic books are omitted (racism and sexuality), but this is quite understandable because we are not in England and this is not the 80's.

"Constantine",2015-07-27," Constantine is an American television series developed by Daniel Cerone and David S. Goyer for NBC, featuring the DC Comics character John Constantine from the comic series Hellblazer.NBC cancelled Constantine after only one season.Seasoned demon hunter and master of the occult John Constantine specializes in giving hell... hell. Armed with a ferocious knowledge of the dark arts and his wickedly naughty wit, he fights the good fight - or at least he did. With his soul already damned to hell, he's decided to leave his do-gooder life behind. But when demons target Liv, the daughter of one of Constantine's oldest friends, he's reluctantly thrust back into the fray - and he'll do whatever it takes to save her. ","8"
"Constantine",2015-07-07," After having seen the movie version with Keeno Reeves, I still keep seeing fans in Hotmail show how tragic it was the t.v. version was taken off. There are plenty of fans.Did what this show from DC comics portray get to close to the real Occult for one or more out there, that practice things of magick? Yes, with a K for the real rituals, spells, conjuring, summoning. Not David Copperfield illusion magic.Did it get a  Davinci Code  reaction that, if only a movie showing a descendant of English named Jesus, not his Hebrew or Aramaic name versions, revealing a present day daughter the Vatican finds too much to hide why movie met with turmoil, that this avatar had companion/wife and daughter, then Matt's part was WAYYYY to close to in Hebrew and Latin spells, some not certain, did someone contact producers to make excuse to remove from NBC broadcast? Amazing that Hollywood was able to get this close to a nerve in one/more people who DO know the truth how close the scenes are to real magick making Occult things happen.You do remember Occult/hidden world always all around us this world but at higher level,frequency, making sight/sound not commonly known, therefore when happens most people from usual religious blinding have no idea what just happened. Matt's part had fun explaining to these blinded minds as people like myself who critique in IMDb have assured people of odd events what happened quite normal for/in that world seen/heard here. You're not going crazy, just not informed by those clergy who wanted you oblivious to the unabashed truth. They prefer you think you're hallucinating from a brain illness. Yes, their lies listened to.Anyway, IMDb, it is hoped that what you read here in editing makes connections with STREAMING NETWORK ONLY that WILL take on our much missed t.v. show. Hulu has, but now needs to continue as series aside repeats.in patris nomen ","10"
"Constantine",2015-07-02," Well, I had high hopes for this one. But unfortunately it did not deliver. Pace is high. Too high. After the pilot a major character is gone off to family. Really? Story lines are rushed. Setting and scenery are quite good. Casting is quite good. It's all a bit too... slick. I for one don't buy it. And it's nothing new. We've seen witches, Dracula and vampires, werewolves, the lot. This is a new take, but it's more of the same. I am not really waiting for this. After watching three episodes I don't want to know what will happen next. A clear sign for me to say goodbye to this one. Ratings are quite high for this one. Hell, it's the reason I tried it in the first place. But enough is enough. ","4"
"Constantine",2015-05-31," I've always loved Constantine and I was very excited when this started but then as the series progressed it just went downhill. My expectations were really high, I was totally disappointed. I don't understand how the writers let this happened, they made him a total asshole with a brain of a chicken. The stubbornness and arrogance were acceptable but the stupidity? Unforgivable.And about the actress who played Zed, she was an awful actress. Her face was just...blank.P.S. Luv and Mate were overused. It gets really annoying.This was a rotten series in general. ","1"
"Constantine",2015-05-20," The series of Constantine of 2014 when it came to the 'eye of the people' i was real interesting to see how it goes and my thoughts was right,and by that i mean what the series has a very cool plot of stores of demons and i was looking forward to see more episodes. When the 13 episode come by Mani tell'No.Brougeria works form me' i was soaked who this could happened a angle who was working with Constantine to save the world of the Apocalypse and especially when Constantine make him for at least a hour and he did not go to the wrong path now he wants to destroyed the world Any way, from that time i was really ''pozest'' to see the next episodes with a amazing exited mode i saw from the subtitle that it was the season finale i was really angry about that but also a big curiosity for what will happened next by making my own thoughts.Even my 10 years old sister was so exiting Don't destroyed this chance and make the second season because we can learn from you so many things and will make it worth it. Nothing is over until the hope of the believers find a way to make the flame to rise again . Constantin's will find the producer to make you worth again . I thing that the NBC will lost a big opportunity which will regret in the future #SAVE CONSTANTINE# i hope to see the Constantine again even it is the last thing i do ","9"
"Constantine",2015-04-19," I love this genre, even though it is easy to go the way of Supernatural  and rely way to heavy on real world religious themes. Constantine has so far maintained this delicate balance and stays squarely within the lines of a core storyline. However, I am afraid this is going to suffer the fate of many of my favorite shows. They are going to do one of two things-- U.S. network programming that isn't specifically called a  Mini-series  either runs- on till it runs out of plot line or gets canceled with no conclusion worth the name. If one of the above happens here...I recommend cutting cable and going an online route. At least that way you watch on your time table and without having to pay extra. ","9"
"Constantine",2015-03-25," Constantine series is one of the best things that I have seen off late and while it still remains a mystery whether there will be a second season or not, I am definitely vouching for another season or more. I liked the movie starring Keanu Reeves but the series is just too good and boy Matt Ryan is just mind blowing with his portrayal of the titular character. There are rumors that Constantine could be a part of the DC Cinematic universe with Matt Ryan as Constantine as Ryan himself has shown interest as such but the truth of these rumors remain far away from reality. Although the series producers are pitching in new ideas to keep the show alive, we have to wait till May when NBC will announce whether there will be a season 2 or not. We already had the sad news that there will be no Dredd 2 (although it's a different aspect but the pain is same) and I hope Constantine doesn't suffer the same fate. So If anyone at NBC is listening, please come out with another season and in the meantime if anyone hasn't seen the series then please do the needful, trust me you won't regret. ","10"
"Constantine",2015-03-11," Its like a modern day Buffy the vampire slayer equivalent, very good program and can't wait for a second season but please don't put this on hold for the flash!Watched 7 episodes of the flash and just lost interest it was same old every time and boring to be honest. Constantine is much much better, are people just rating the flash better because its more famous? Its not famous in england id never heard of it until big bang theory.So Apparently you need 10 lines?Well i don't need 10 lines to say its good??Still not 10? Really, oh at last thank god!?! ","8"
"Constantine",2015-02-26," I really enjoyed this serial...well played ... nice storyline some episodes are supernatural and sometimes feels sci-fi that is not good ... being possessed is nice :D try to continue like what happens in the real world base on truth ... thanks for visual effects and nice editing...I really like this serial to continue and impress me every episode...thanks for making this ... I Love Constantine Story from the first movie... at first I did not attracted to the character of John Constantine and didn't get why Chaz is immortal but as it continued it felt much better. now john is more appealing and likable. please continue making more seasons and make it more mysterious and put more exorcisms in it ... thanks ","10"
"Constantine",2015-02-15," Whilst I wouldn't say Constantine is dreadful there is something lacking in this series. Perhaps its the  devil is out to get humanity  theme that seems tired and out of place in the increasingly atheistic 21st century? Perhaps its the rather predictable story lines? Or maybe its something about the cast?For me its the last of these, the cast, that really holds this series back. There's a noticeable lack of chemistry between cast members which is exacerbated by Constantine's rather clichéd and grating British  matey, matey, ello Guv  routine. The result is tiresome characters you really don't invest that much in. As a consequence when they are threatened, you really are not that interested in what happens to them, robbing the series of the tension and pace it desperately needs. On the upside, (yes there is one) the series does offer a few scares and some novel villains. Its not utterly dreadful but, in my opinion, more considered casting and character development would have made this series more enjoyable. Five out of ten from me. ","5"
"Constantine",2015-02-14," John Constantine (Matt Ryan) is already damned to Hell and struggles to battle evil on earth with his knowledge of the occult. Manny (Harold Perrineau) is an angel who provides mercurial assistance. Zed Martin (Angélica Celaya) is his clairvoyant assistant. Chas Chandler (Charles Halford) is his assistant with multiple lives. Papa Midnite (Michael James Shaw) is a voodoo practitioner who is sometimes Constantine's opponent. There is a rising darkness which Constantine must uncover.Matt Ryan is quite good as Constantine. He has a bit of humor and charm which Keanu Reeves' brooding version didn't have. On the other hand, the other characters in the gang are played by rather bland actors giving a bland effort. The exception is Perrineau but he's not really a part of the gang. The chemistry isn't really there for the group. Actually Lucy Griffiths is pretty good in the pilot but for some reason, she leaves with the show. This show has some potential but the characters don't gel before the show gets canceled. ","6"
"Constantine",2015-02-12," Matt Ryan is a horribly bad actor. and hate that he is from england. I think the TV series is good but very bad actors. I do not understand why they changed Lucy Griffiths to Angélica Celaya for Lucy Griffiths would have been more but the creators of the series would begin on a deal so they changed very pretty from what it would be. this is just my opinion, I like Keanu Reeves in the movie Constantine from 2005 if you have not seen it take a look.1 back actors.2.he is from england.3.they replaced the Lucy Griffiths ","4"
"Constantine",2015-02-08," Having been a casual Hellblazer reader, I was quite interested in the treatment this show would get on TV. Whilst admittedly nearly all American TV shows pilots suck, I was pleased that it remained much more faithful to the comics than the Constantine movie - which wasn't really Constantine at all.The show has your typical weekly episodes set against a larger plot arc of a mysterious rising darkness. Constantine is a two-bit sorcerer with a chequered past. Week to week John investigates demonic mysteries.What I like about this show is it has original plots, and the writers aren't desperately trying to tell me that the character is morally ambiguous (like the woeful Backstrom which is basically characters announcing each others traits to each other with all the subtlety of Mardi Gras). The supporting characters feel fleshed out and there feels like is a wealth of backstory to explore (because there is - the Hellblazer canon is quite extensive). Just when the series begins to feel formulaic, the show surprises me. It's one of the only shows that has steadily maintained my interest over it's run, and I'm quite picky.Charles Halford is a superb supporting actor who I hope to see more of. (Terry from True Blood). Harrold Perrineau as the angel Manny is a character I enjoy seeing more of.It's a shame that Constantine is on the chopping block - it's quite popular here in Australia. Matt Ryan makes an excellent Constantine, the show captures a dark gritty atmosphere, coupled with a credible demonology & compelling plot arc. It would be a shame if this show went the way of Firefly, because it really does have the capability to be a solid performer. There's a wealth of material to draw upon for a number of seasons without it getting old, and NBC have managed to not only get themselves a pretty decent cast (at no doubt a pretty decent price) but also a team of solid writers. It's pretty rare you get all those things in the same place. ","9"
"Constantine",2015-01-31," DO NOT READ IF YOU HAVE NOT WATCHED THE SHOW!1: So Constantine checks himself into an asylum and has electro-shock therapy to get rid of his memories, almost like lobotomy. IF this is the case, why does he remember everything as though the electro-shock therapy never happened? If it does not work on him because of who he is, wouldn't he have known that it wouldn't work (since it hints that he's been doing this to himself for a while now)? It was almost like he wanted to be electrocuted in the brain...but he just didn't want to say it directly.2: What's with the constant brooding? Gosh, even Batman smiles more than this guy.3: The lady in the asylum, which he saves, writes on the wall Liv Die. We assume Liv is a person or a thing. Yet, somehow, Constantine instantly knows that Liv refers to a girl on the other side of the planet who works in a small town electronics store. Really? Wow, I didn't realize that there was only one person on the planet named or nicknamed 'Liv'. 4: What made the ground open up and almost swallow said Liv? There was nothing inside - it's almost like the ground imploded into a big circle of flame, and then suddenly Constantine rocks up with Frankenstein and saves her after speaking to some Angel (I assume it was an Angel). 5: Back to point 4, does she not freak out that a huge hole tried to swallow her? She just runs off and goes back home and to bed? Wow, this lady must've seen some crazy stuff growing up.6: This has several pain points... a) Why is there an Eye of Horus carved on her door? No explanation, just  Oh, that's the Eye of Horus carved on your door ... b) Did it even explain the salt-line on her door? Did she not notice it when she stepped out and back into her room/apartment? c) Who called the cops about her dead friend? She lives RIGHT NEXT TO HER and didn't hear her die, didn't hear the screams/sirens/cops until AFTER they are taking the body away? And then...what...she just goes back inside her room and goes to sleep again? d) Why would a demon possess her body AFTER it is locked in a bag and driven in a truck? Why not simply possess her while she's alive, and then go to Liv's house and kill her? Seems like this demon is dumb as doggy poop. e) If the demons can 'sense' Liv, it would've known that she wouldn't be at work. So why would the demon drive the truck into her desk? She was miles away - halfway across the country it seemed. 7: The Demon Seal Constantine paints is not very effective, is it?! Firstly, the demon sees it (again, dumb as doggy poop), and secondly it does not do anything to make them powerless. Also, how did Constantine surround the demons in a circle of flames? If the paint was flammable, why wouldn't the entire thing (not just the outer rim) catch on fire?8: She can see 'other dimensions' with the amulet thing her father used. That's fine in itself. But she does not really see anything unless she concentrates. Okay, a stretch but I'm patient. Then she sees her grandma when she's questioning her mother. Fine, let's go with that. But then...she can't see anything weird again until Constantine holds the amulet with her - then she instantly sees EVERYTHING! Why? Because Constantine has the ability to...no he does not...he does not have anything like her ability. Okay, again...WHY? Is she SUDDENLY and INSTANTLY in a state of total and utter concentration when he grabs her amulet that she is able to see everything about the other dimension? (And, on another note, how come all the 'ghosts' she can see are all HOT?)9:  I'm Constantine . Okay, I accept that name even though I've never met you, just saw something freaky but am fine with it, and jumpy but, for some reason, don't have any problem with a British guy following me.  I knew your father...  That's not possible because he died decades ago.  But it's true.  Okay, I believe you - now I'll go interrogate my mother, who immediately tells me she lied when, for the last 20-something years she never told me...presumably because I never asked.  You can see things others can't.  Yep, makes sense to me. Where is your dungeon with weird, creepy artifacts and old books with ancient spells and whatnot? Oh, right there. (Seriously...even the Winchester boys find it difficult to convince the people they have saved that they saved them from something supernatural.)10: I know that some people have made parallels with Castiel (Supernatural) and Constantine of DC Comics fame, and perhaps Castiel's character is loosely based on Constantine. But that does not mean if you make a show that is actually about Constantine you make him dress the EXACT SAME WAY! What, are they running low on wardrobe budgets in TV Shows? At least give him a different colored trench-coat, even if it means going slightly away from the comics. And the brooding...my goodness...can you get more self-indulgent?! This guy walks around with a face that screams,  IT'S ALL MY FAULT...EVERYTHING IS MY FAULT...I WISH I WAS DEAD  and talks as though everyone should instantly believe him no matter how crazy he sounds (luckily, however, Liv seems to believe every word he says and is immediately willing to give up everything about her current existence to follow him - how fortunate for them both?). I gave this show 5 stars, but I should really give it 1 since I don't plan on watching it again. If this is how the comic book strip was written, I'm glad I never read it. Ugh... ","5"
"Constantine",2015-01-18," First of all , hats off to Matt Ryan for actually bringing the crazy witty bastard we all know as John Constantine to life. A true gem and a revolution in bringing the less glorified and star spangled yet utterly brilliant comic characters to life. I've been a fan of hellblazer since i was a kid, the dark creepy twisted plots and the always witty John Constantine, always having an ace up his sleeve, always surviving. The charisma the actors exude, the level of believability is very carefully plotted and the true comic genre is employed quite fantastically. Hope this show runs long alongside the spangled spandex runners and proves that u don't need hugely popular and socially feasible hero characters to come up with a brilliant show. I'll give it 10, yes, for being true to Constantine, and especially for holding no bars, may it be gore , creepiness, nudity or just the plain simple religious incantations. Absolutely Promising and spine chilling. ","10"
"Constantine",2015-01-11," This show is a joke. They either tried to target viewers from almost every major religion, or they just took a bit from every religion and put it together just to make it look cool and...what? What is this supposed to mean? Even the spells and magical artifacts are just some random nonsense. In the first episode Constantine exorcises a demon using names from Christianity, Hinduism, Islam, and God knows what else. Really? There is another part that they show a skull that has some Latin, an orthodox seal in Greek that says Jesus Christ wins, and some scribblings about the Holy Spirit:) At least use something original. Putting together random words from different religions and using Greek words (because you think its cool) doesn't make a TV show. Absolutely no originality, and no plot. ","2"
"Constantine",2014-12-29," Let me start off by saying I hate to be one of those people who didn't even finish a couple of episodes before writing a review but I honestly couldn't get myself to finish the first one. For the first half an hour of the first episode instead of being interesting and catchy for the audience the acting felt cheap and cheesy, the special effects were mostly terrible for something that is made in 2014, and altogether felt like a cheap knockoff of Supernatural. To be exact this's what killed the show for me in the first episode:1. The special effects at the beginning when the possessed girl was flying all over.2. The girl who is the main character (which I don't even know if she's supposed to be a high-school girl or a college girl or what exactly). So let me get this right, her car acts crazy, the ground is destroyed, a hell hole opens up with fire and stuff, a creepy guy shows up, her friend dies, and she remains completely composed? doesn't freak out or cry or anything? are you kidding me? So back to the part where she met a creepy guy after that and another creepy guy who she saw in her building (which in real life is a murder suspect) but she doesn't tell the cops about them and trusts whats said in a fortune cookie? Oooooooook I'm done. 3. And the last part that at which point I had to stop watching because my intelligence was offended. You see they were in a taxi cab which was hit by a truck and then the next scene you see all doors are closed, Constantine is magically outside the car and the girl is asking for help because... the doors are shut, sooooo he can teleport? 4. Lets take a moment of silence for the Stupid Demon. So a demon misses with the girls car, and electricity all around, he even killed her  friend  but he wasn't able to kill her at the beginning because she was running? I can keep going but if its like this for the first 30 minutes or so what's going to be like after that. ","3"
"Constantine",2014-12-25," I have been reading the Constantine comics for a long time. This show follows a lot of the information from the comics. Also Matt Ryan's acting is on point of what I would think Constantine would act in TV show and movie form. There is a chance this show might be cancelled with only 1 season but each new episode is better than the one before.This show is only getting close to getting canceled because of the time slot it has been put in. On Friday many people do not have the time to watch shows. So I hope NBC also changes the time and day of this show airs. NBC should definitely give this wonderful show another season with the amazing stories it has from the HellBlazer Comics. ","10"
"Constantine",2014-12-18," Firstly, the show is OK. I am not a fan of the comic book so cannot comment on its faithfulness to it. I watched the movie and liked so decided to give the TV show a watch based on this. However, I cannot get over the accent of Constantine. According to his own admission he is supposed to be from Liverpool. Originally I thought the actor was an American who spent to much time trying to imitate Sean Bean cause the accent he speaks with is a Yorkshire one. Then I discover Matt Ryan is actually Welsh so he definitely should know better. The only conclusion I can draw is that he was told to sound like Sean Bean cause it maybe would help the rating. What's wrong with the scouse accent? I am not from Liverpool but I know live close to the city and I love the accent. Also Constantine mentions that he spent time as a child in the mines in Liverpool. There ain't no mines in Liverpool. Corporates... I despair of your meddling in the creative process. However, if this is the doing of the writers then you should be ashamed of yourselves. ","5"
"Constantine",2014-12-18," Right, i'll jump straight to the point. I haven't seen the movie, so that could by why i'm not keen on this TV Show. But i have watch everything so far, which is Season 1 Up to Episode 8. I like the idea of the series, and the acting isn't so bad either. But the way new things are just being put into place like we should know about them is ridiculous, i thought maybe as it gets further into the season things will be explained. But no, it just doesn't happen, new things get introduced each episode e.g a Necklace, Talisman type of thing but it never explains what they are, what they do or anything about it. For me this is a huge let down, even some of the characters we don't know anything about, for example why his sidekick comes back to life? History between John Constantine and other characters. I don't know, it just seems to be a let down. However, since i am keen on the idea of the series i will continue to watch in hope that things will get better, although at the moment i do not recommend this series. ","3"
"Constantine",2014-12-13," The concept is great in theory but the vision is not fulfilled as well as it could be. Many of the scenes seem pointlessly rushed and leaves you scratching your head wondering why the director didn't attempt to tie the scenes together better.( feels like a bunch of cut scenes at times) the dialogue of the script is weak at times either sounding cheesy or like the screenwriters are attempting to prolong the limited storyline they've created thus far. I will say that Matt Ryan is a magnetic actor and brings some depth to the role but at times is victim to the poor script. Some of the supporting cast and episode  fill ins  do not seem very passionate about there roles and simply spew out one liners which takes away from the parts of the show that are crafted well.. I do not understand why people are rating this a 7+ when n fact it is honestly only at about a 5 at this time. Please don't get me wrong, the potential to be a 7 is there but I believe NBC needs to bring in a seasoned writer to help the show plug up some of its holes. ","5"
"Constantine",2014-12-13," So im going to start by saying that i am a big fan of the hellblazer and constantine new 52 comics but that will not impend to much on this review Constantine starts with its first 3 episodes being a little drawn out whilst it develops the characters throughout the series. BUT after the 3 episodes it really comes in to its own. Creating dynamic story lines and also using story lines directly from the hellblazer comic books What makes this series so good is that the source material is strong mixed with a cast and crew that really care for the characters and the on screen portrait of those characters So what could be added to the series to make it better. Not much. Maybe some darker story lines but we shall see more of that in due time ","9"
"Constantine",2014-12-09," I've now watched 6 or 7 episodes, each time hoping for something better than the previous episode. By  better , I'm really pointing to something to care about, something that actually has significance or meaning.The basic ideas... Constantine's past and this season's unnamed villain ...are fine. But I find his past is now overcooked, we know the trauma and we get that it's affecting him. A more subtle approach to developing this aspect of him is needed, unless the aim is to make him a contemptible, self-loathing, pitiful wretch... which I doubt.The as-yet unnamed villain's story arc is far too underdeveloped. There are other pieces of glue stringing each episode together but nothing very powerful. So far, each episode seems too procedural. We aren't getting on with the overall story for the season very well.The show itself has good visuals and decent enough acting. Constantine's mannerisms and speech took some getting used to, though. It's a bit over the top and far too cocky... but you eventually realize that's how he's supposed to be.Anyway, I may well lose interest unless the main story picks up. They really need to find a better balance between episode-specific plot elements and the big picture. This show has the potential to be a solid 8/10. ","5"
"Constantine",2014-12-08," This show is one of the best horror/suspense TV shows out there. A little rough around the edges, as it has just started. Cast: Matt Ryan(who previously played Edward Kenway) is excellent and trumps all previous interpretations of Constantine (well, last Constantine was Keanu Reeves; so no surprises there). Angelica Celaya as Zed -- I don't know what to say. Sometimes, she displays good acting skills; other times, she's just.. there. Harold Perineau is brilliant. Other actors are good too. Guest actors could have been chosen better.Story: A story that plays out as an exorcist's fight against the raising darkness. At least that's what the first 3 episodes are. I had almost deigned it to be a SPN-ripoff when episode 4 happened. It was brilliant! It showcased the title character's goods and evils perfectly.Other aspects: One plus here is the special effects -- the effects used are very good. Ask the SPN fan who rubbishes Constantine about the effects, they'd have to stab themselves with the Angelic blade.Overall: Must watch ","10"
"Constantine",2014-12-06," Many might remember Keanu Reeves' Constantine movie. While a good movie it had nothing to do with the comic book character John Constantine. This TV series seems so far to be going back to the comic books and finally getting this character pretty darn close. He's a Brit. Blond. Trenchcoat. Miserable as all. And finally I saw him smoke a cigarette. THAT is John Constantine. I just fear that NBC will not give this show a chance. I hope they do and keep the characters and stories where they come from, the comic books. I have not seen Matt Ryan in anything else but he is spot on brilliant in this role. Plucked straight from the comics. Yes I am heavy on referring to the comics because that is where John comes from. Zedd is more mysterious in the comic and does not hang around so much but we need a female in the show and she can do it. I'm not sure about the Angel but let's see what he brings. This show though is all about one person and they are doing that person justice. ","10"
"Constantine",2014-11-30," Found it hard to get through even the first episode. I honestly don't know if there is any compliment to be made at all. Acting is sometimes average, but the main character is definitely over-the-top. It has absolutely nothing to do with the original character, but even if you don't care about that, it's just plain bad.The script is terrible, presumably written for teens. If they aren't too demanding, maybe this pathetic attempt at making money will succeed for a while.I don't even consider this series 'average', that's why I gave it a 3. I can't figure would anyone give it a 7, except if you don't give much thought to it. It may be one of the worst series I've watched in a while.Find something else to do. There plenty of good movies, series, to watch. Read a book. Go outside. Don't watch this. Don't do this to yourself. Seriously. It's so bad it's offensive. ","3"
"Constantine",2014-11-26," As of now, five episodes have aired. Most of the reviews written here concern the first, perhaps second, episode. Not many have come back to update their thoughts on the series, so the reviews are a bit bleak.In the beginning, it was stumbling a bit. They decided to go with a different female lead which meant scenes for the pilot had to be re-shot/rewritten and in turn it seemed a bit disjointed. But, for me, I tend to give new series a few episodes before forming an opinion.The pilot stumbled. The second seemed to steady itself. And from the third episode on, the show's stance has grown more steady and stronger. The actors have slipped into their characters and seem to be wearing them more comfortably which comes through on screen. Now that the writers have decided which direction they want to go, they're doing so beautifully.John Constantine is a bastard of a character (which is why so many of us love him) and Matt Ryan is perfect for it. He works not only aesthetically, but because he manages to find the perfect balance between jerk and charming, he's brought the character to life.It's not often I look forward to the day a show airs, but I've begun doing so with Constantine. Waiting for a week in between each episode is more noticeable now because I can't wait to see what they plan to do next.If you're a fan of the comic book series or just finding it, I suggest you give the show a chance. ","8"
"Constantine",2014-11-25," As far as I remember, John always was a serious fellow. Spoke less, pondered more. This series is bullshit, John is portrayed as exactly opposite of what he was in the original hellblazer comics. This John is funny, easily reveals secrets, loves to flirt, behaves super smart. This is exactly what the guys in supernatural do. The creators have ruined the legendary John Constantine. Keanu Reevs was close, Matt Ryan can never be. Please do not destroy the character. Please do not destroy the image of John Constantine please. Please do not make a second season please. Mr Jamie Delano, how could you allow this to run sir? God these people have destroyed John Constantine, may demons have no mercy on them. ","4"
"Constantine",2014-11-24," Constantine is the best thing currently on television, in my opinion. It's a show about a human doing bogus metaphysics and not a metahuman doing bogus physics, which makes it different from Flash. It's true to the source material (making it different from both Arrow and Gotham) without being a slave to it (making it worth watching instead of just reading).Matt Ryan and Angelica Celaya's on-screen chemistry is exquisite, sexual tension real but not overpowering. Special effects whose corniness is justified by the circumstances, and to my mind the most important bit: real, human stories.Amidst the occult, the psychic, the voodoo and the demonic, the show is about redemption, worldview, escaping, and struggling with  inner demons.  Constantine is entertaining, but more than giving you something to care about, it gives you something to relate to. And as far as I'm concerned, there's room for humans to do business in a TV world bigger than sit-coms. ","10"
"Constantine",2014-11-24," The writers and designers have done an outstanding job with filling the script, the set, and the costumes with all kinds of details true the comic books and the DC world. (The arcane laboratory is fantastic!) There is also a rich dark feel to the whole show that is pure Vertigo. The whole vibe is creepy and wonderful, and fills that blurry good-vs-evil void that Buffy and Angel left behind, without getting maudlin and soap-operatic. The chemistry between John and Zed is snarky and fun, and the supporting cast is so good. Papa Midnite is PERFECT, and Chas is brilliant. One thing that really works is the special effects. They don't get hokey or feel CGI'ed to ridiculousness- A contorting demon, instead of being twisted by camera tricks, is played by an acrobat that leaves you breathless the 15 seconds she is on scene. I so hope NBC doesn't let this one go; it would be as bad a move as Fox dropping Firefly. ","9"
"Constantine",2014-11-22," i love this show very much no offense to anyone who is disliking it. i have seen the 5 episodes as of today and i really like the way the show is progressing. my only big question is how can chas be still alive after dying two times ? first he was killed in the pilot episode by a wire and now in the 5th episode by the woman with scissors. he clearly was dead but again he revived . how is that possible for a human being ? is he a host to some entity or just immortal or something entirely else? please reply if anyone knows the answer. also Matt Ryan nails the role of jc . i had huge doubts about him after keanu (yes i liked the movie very much) but he just effing nails the role. zed is also not bad in her role we have a lot more to know about her past. chas is doing the usual sidekick type. Manny and papa midnite are really awesome . and the biggest surprise was Jim corrigan . his fore shadowing the role of spectre and his charisma is a boon for this show . hoping to see more and more of the show and the characters . hope dr.fate, pandora, zatanna, dead man, swamp thing shows up too can't wait . ","10"
"Constantine",2014-11-19," I would like to mention that there is a certain lack of aura in the main character, a thing Keanu really put into his act. The acting is decent enough, but there is nothing of Keanu's nerve in his acting. Whereas Reeve's took his line breaks at the exact moment they were needed to emphasize the act, this Constantine is looking as if he were chased by a dozen monsters when trying to explain something or even having a casual talk. Moreover, the thick irish accent doesn't quite complement his voice and our expectancy of the mature all-knowing fatigue of his character. His act is somehow better suited for a teenager Constantine rather than the bad-arse evil-banning guy we all loved. ","6"
"Constantine",2014-11-17," I've read the comics. And I have a soft spot for John Constantine. The Keanu Reeves movie was in my opinion well done. But Reeves missed the subtle characteristics of John. The Hellblazer comic was supposed to be a intelligent look at a warlock named John Constantine who is a complete lying and con man. He has a really nasty habit of having his friends die around him. The Show reminds me of the comic a lot. now it won't be the comic. Anything that is adapted to another medium such as TV or the movies is bound to have changes. It won't be 100% Constatine Comic book. But here they nailed down the essence of what that comic is about. John Constatine is a haunted man. the mistakes of his past are starting to come back and haunt him. Hell wants him in the worst possible way. Heaven doesn't want him . and so John must try to redeem himself somewhat by saving others. Of course John is a cheeky lying con man who is only in it for his own goals. But sometimes. Sometimes the Hero in John rises to the occasion and he fights evil just to save lives. Because he knows what is right and what is wrong. And John Constantine is a regular person who needs to be prodded into taking the right course of action. If you like Supernatural. Give Constantine a chance it's a walk down that same dark road Dean and Sam Winchester take every week. And I'd like to think the Winchester's and John would get along nicely. If it's not your cup of tea well change the channel. but if it is. Watch it you will be surprised and rewarded for your patience. And Loyality. ","10"
"Constantine",2014-11-17," First, I need to beseech people to stop comparing the show to the original plot! It is not necessary to follow the original story line! Its is a good thing that the team actually make some changes to make it way more interesting. So please do not restrict yourselves to that plot you have read before, Constantine is an amazing show with numerous possibilities for future episodes.The psychological turmoil in Constantine himself as well as in his friends around him is awesome. I am kept guessing on what really happen in New Castle and i am hoping we see a conclusion at the end of this season(: The stark contrast of Zed's personality just highlights how much pain and guilt Constantine is in all the time even if he puts on a brave front. In fact, Zed's actions help me see how vulnerable Constantine is now (as seen at the end of the episode). i believe that Zed's gonna impact him in some way down the road. Constantine has his flaws, no doubt, being cocky and kinda don't really know who he is but hey it it only the first few episodes, you cant expect a character to be perfect right from the start. With Constantine being introduced to the audience as a combination of _______ and ______ (fill in the blanks yourself), it actually sets up the setting for the character development - I look forward to that.(:The effects and creatures were awesome! So far Constantine has seen different kinds of demons, spirits and creatures already from different origins. It makes the show very very interesting and i keep wanting more after every episode. The unpredictability of what is going to happen next and what Constantine needs to go through to help safe people is never a mundane task.I absolutely love this show and I hope those who watches it accepts this show for what it is and not keep wanting the exact reincarnation of the story line.(:(note:I am not pointing out any particular people here, it is just general comments i have read and heard on social media) ","9"
"Constantine",2014-11-17," I really wanted to like it. I like the comics, and I liked the movie. The pilot was a little slow and disjointed, but that's how pilots go. As a fan of the hell blazer comics, I was hoping for much more than what the network had served up. The acting is okay, but writing is very poor. I think David S. Goyer shouldn't write for TV. First Da vinci's Demon and now this!! He is one of the best writers currently in movie industry but not impressed with both of his TV series!! I think the main problem is NBC.Personally I think it should be in Cable. The show needs to become darker. Honestly I liked the performance of Matt Ryan as John but for me Zed was not so impressive. And the angel character was unnecessary. I've watched 4 episodes till now and If the coming episodes does not get better, I think I'll be done with the show ","7"
"Constantine",2014-11-17," First of, the Keanu film - it is a good film, but it is nothing like John Constantine in the comics. Not really. When I saw this series was coming out I had low expectations as it would take a real fanboy to make this work. In some respects, the Keanu film brought Constantine to the masses and paved the way for this series so people at least knew it was about demons etc.The man playing Constantine is from Swansea, not Liverpool, doesn't smoke and is not completely 100%, but plays the part really really well. For those small differences, I can ignore them. Ryan is a good Constantine, and feels real. The pilot was almost cheesy different from the rest of the episodes. I enjoyed it, but I wasn't sure where it would go. Episode 2 onwards is where it finds its feet. There is a lot of fan references within the episodes to geek over, the casting is brilliant, the story lines are believable and after watching episode 5, it left me feeling really depressed. That may sound bad, but the morality and choices that need to be made, has emotional impact. I care about the characters, the story is interesting and real, whenever I genuinely feel emotion when watching something, means it is very good.I wish I could watch this new again and binge watch the first 5 episodes in a row. Really recommend this and want to see where it is going. ","9"
"Constantine",2014-11-16," There is only so much you can do with this title, but they have done everything they can. Four Episodes in and I'm hooked, as a fan of Hellblazer I know that I can't expect to see word for word representations of what's going on but so far it seems that they're on to a good thing here. The show is definitely rough around the edges, sure, but it's John Constantine the pure definition of rough around the edges. Anyway, the show has some negatives in a sense that it's still trying to find it's feet bit it's still learning to walk but it's got the right steps down. How many other  comic book  type shows mention, even remotely, the first chapter of the comic book? Very few. Give credit where it's due. ","10"
"Constantine",2014-11-14," I had high hopes for this show going in, I figured that it would be a great antihero and of course we would have the righteous battles of good vs. evil and heaving vs. hell. And it seemed that the show was leaning in that general direction the writing of not bad the mood was right and then walks in the main antihero, Constantine. In the movie of course we had a great actor play him so he did it right, he gave him some wounded deep seeded emotion and let our minds run away with us. However in this rendition we had some guy who just doesn't get it.Instead of playing him as a dark wounded exorcist in search of redemption this guy just acts like an arrogant clown. There's not a shred of likability about him which is the problem. I can get behind an antihero that goes back and forth, but not behind this guy. First episode went by and I figured the ones that followed would make him likable, but he just got worse with every episode. At this point I'm seriously giving it a 4 only for all the actors that have to work with this reject. So sad that 1 terrible lead just decimated an otherwise perfectly good show. ","4"
"Constantine",2014-11-14," If you like Supernatural, don't be deceived. This is not the show for you.I have watched all the episodes (3) aired so far. To watch them was a struggle. I kept watching it in good faith. But I can now guarantee that this show is not worth it's spot on television. The only people who would really care about this show are those who are emotionally attached to the original series-nostalgic individuals.The main actor has potential, but there is simply no appeal in the cast. No charm. None of the men are particularly attractive... The directing is lax, the writing as well. The storytelling is not compelling.Supernatural has already been on the air for ten years. As a result, everything felt like a poor copy of what Supernatural has already accomplished and established. The lore...everything. I know the comics came first-- the show  Constantine still feels stolen from Supernatural. Especially Castiel's outfit. Sorry. They are stepping on a lot of toes. Television is Supernatural's realm already.Because Supernatural is still dealing with all things that go bump in the night, there is no purpose for this show. I will not be wasting my time watching it again ( or finishing the 3rd episode...couldn't last till the end).Cease and desist. ","1"
"Constantine",2014-11-12," I've only recently become a fan of the Constantine comics after the new 52 series came out. I like the acting. I like the feel of the show and how it flows. The story is intriguing so far. My main complaints come from the lazy cookie cutter story telling and the character development. Constantine is supposed to be a couple things. First, he is a master of the dark arts. This should mean he shouldn't be caught off guard every episode. He should be able to work himself out of any situation whether by magic or charm, and when the show fails to write that into the story it's missing something very big. Next, Constantine is an asshole, so much so that most of the time you shouldn't be able to believe what he just did or said and I think the show gets that, but just hasn't put in enough. Lastly, when it comes down to it, he cares so much about the people around him. It's what I love about the comics. He sacrifices so much after he makes such an effort to put up this front that he doesn't like anybody and doesn't need anybody . The show has potential, but I need so more of the John Constantine that I hate to love and more John Constantine with knowledge and power that I never see coming. ","7"
"Constantine",2014-11-11," Far from what I have seen, this is a good show because I do not know about the character. I had to look him up on Wikipedia to get a better understanding because I do not read comics. It is what I do with shows that are spin-offs or comic related. The main comic characters like wonder woman, batman, and superman I know, but the lesser comics I do not. It reminds me of supernatural meets Grimm because there is John who knows magical ways and demons like the winchesters and have toys, but gets helped by people who have other abilities much like how the Grimm sees Wezen. It is still a good show despite it being like my 2 favorite shows. ","8"
"Constantine",2014-11-08," After three episodes it's getting better, i felt the first one a little weak because i couldn't dig the acting of Lucy Griffiths (who made the character of Liv Aberdine), maybe this kind of show just wasn't for her. Besides that, i really liked the visual effects and the main character, Constantine, and the general plot about Heaven vs. Hell with humans in the middle.Now with Angélica Celaya as the new co-protagonist on the second chapter you can feel a better chemistry between the two characters.I think it's an entertaining show so far, and i really really hope they have a good first season to see more about this world that i really love, since the Constantine movie i've been waiting to see more from this universe ","10"
"Constantine",2014-11-05," I was looking forward to a television series of Constantine - I loved the movie and was pretty certain that they would do well with a series. That being said, I was not expecting a carbon copy of the movie, nor is my opinion based on a comparison thereof. I actually appreciated the fact that this would be a stand-alone show - not following on in any way.Even so, the show's writers and producers must have known that they would have a following from the word go, and I can't really fault them for the disappointment I felt after watching the terrible first and, arguably worse, second episodes. Well, not entirely. Sure, some of the storyline was tiresomely predictable and when JC utters his ritual mumbo-jumbo, it is rather reminiscent of  how, now, brown, cow .But the real let-down of the show is the acting. Let's be honest - line delivery is crucial and this cast chronically fails to deliver. The performances are rather terrible, with the result that JC is not a lovable rogue, but rather plainly unlikeable. About the only character I can stand at this point is Chas, and his airtime thus far is virtually non-existent. The 3 stars I've given to the show is basically for their special effects department - kudos to them, the show is visually great. It's just a pity it's not enough to make the series bearable. ","3"
"Constantine",2014-11-04," I must have checked it at least ten times to ensure that i m watching the series from its very first episode. The premiere episode was so chaotic that my head was spinning out of control after watching it. Nothing made sense and everything was being thrown to you at a rapid pace for you to grab any sense out of anything being shown.It was like the team wanted to squeeze an entire season into one episode. People and their actions along with their dialogues were all cryptic and i don't think even the actors were aware of what was happening. On one side there is the confusion over things happening without no explanation, flow or scheme and then as a fuel to the fire you have an English actor playing the central character whose diction is itself a hard shell to crack and add to that the misery of watching his acting that is like somebody on extreme sugar rushIf you have watched the movie Constantine starring Keanu Reeves, then you will understand the grievances i have towards Matt Ryan. while Keanu reeves successfully portrayed the arrogant, troubled and brooding character of Constantine, Matt was unable to convince of the same.The graphics on the other hand was pretty impressive and a great visual delight but unfortunately without a solid script , a befitting central character, the series is not much to look forward toIf anything goes like the first episode then this series is a thorough disaster waiting to happen but since it has only been one episode so far, i will try for another chance for the series, even though there is no hope visible as of now.After Watching Second episode Yes things have settled down but does that mean it is getting interesting?sadly No would be an appropriate answer for me. Second episode was more focused if i may say so but the main lead and his accent is still a great concern for me. The episode format more or less reminds me of the series  supernatural . it is failing to grab my attention and i have actually no particular will to follow it as such. BUT NEVER SAY NEVER ","4"
"Constantine",2014-10-27," Premiere episode reminds me of a very old joke.An octogenarian is installed in a retirement home by his children.His first night there, a female occupant of the same age surprises him on route to his room, and challenges  Super Sex?  The gentleman thinks about this for a moment, and finally responds  I'll take the soup, thank you very much.  This show verily defines the word  ambitious  in that it is not only attempting to bring a graphic novel to life, but it also has to knowingly suffer comparisons to the film, which featured a remarkably smooth and assured performance by KR.I do like the casting. Ryan brings to mind the outrageous casting of Johnny Lee Miller in the equally outrageous Sherlock Holmes knock-off called Elementary.And that was the good news. All of it.The bad news is that the opening episode, as other reviewers have already noted, showcased bad dialogue, bad casting (the girl), and a disturbing lack of continuity.It was as if someone dropped EXORCIST and THE BIG SLEEP into a metaphysical blender, and got this. With Bogey playing Constantine, or at least a younger, British version of Bogey.Personally, I almost liked it, but, then, I spend too much time watching TV and can be lured into a show simply by sheer novelty.I am not sure the average viewer, a viewer who can push buttons on his PVR and instantly get SHIELD or ARROW or PERSON OF INTEREST or PENNY DREADFUL, will be quite as forgiving...? Bottom line, it is clever, it is quirky, but it offers almost nothing that connects with the viewer or commands the kind of viewer loyalty you need to maintain a weekly series.Nor did it help that, same day this aired, Marvel announced that Benedict Cumberbatch will play Doctor Strange.I'll have the soup, please ","7"
"Constantine",2014-10-27," Why is this so good? Probably for the simple reason that Jamie Delano, Garth Ennis & Alan Moore are on board. These 2 made the comic I loved soar when I subscribed to it all those years ago. That's right, this is no Keanu Reeves version of our favorite Hellblazer. This is the real deal. His compatriots are back. His story arc and background story intact. I just finished episode 1 and like Gothem having Frank Miller & Bob Kane (probably the best writers of Batman comics and going way back ) on the writing staff, this show Constantine will be appreciated by fans for what hopefully will be a sustained effort at excellence in writing and faithfulness to character. The Hellblazer of Alan Moore and Garth Ennis is a deeply flawed and nuanced John Constantine and with Chaz and Zed at his side this wrecking crew are sure to make a dent in hell's plots.Other Comic luminaries that worked on the monumental character are Dave McKean, Grant Morrison, Neil Gaiman and Stephen Bissette. Let's hope this television series will do a fitting tribute to the excellence of writing and artistic talent due to its pedigree. ","8"
"Constantine",2014-10-27," Being a fan of the character for a long time, I can say THIS is THE John Constantine I'd hoped for in the barf-of-a-movie that everybody seems to love (Keannu Reeves as Hellblazer? REALLY?) Everyone who'd read Hellblazer at any moment knows this is how you do it right. I have greater hopes for the show knowing the Newcatle Crew and Astra are there and Zed will become part of the show (I mean, no bad feelings for Liv but she kind of reminded me of Rachel Weiss... NO THANKS) I'm very eager to see what's going to happen through the rest of the series and I know we'll get there, the point where everyone is satisfied (except for Alan Moore of course) BTW. 17 easter eggs to the DC Universe... just WOW.

"Constantine",2014-10-27," Being a MASSIVE fan of the Hellblazer comics, I was dead excited to see that they were finally going to bring an accurate version of John Constantine to life. No offense to Keanu Reeves, who did a badass job, but Matt Ryan has done a brilliant job of capturing this character for who he really is. To anyone comparing this to supernatural, PLEASE don't. Give me a break. Supernatural was INSPIRED by the Hellblazer comics (it's in the Supernatural Wiki). i.e., Constantine came first. Saying  we don't need another Supernatural  couldn't be more wrong. Supernatural has lost the plot, and is no where near as good as it was before. This brings an entirely new, fresh viewing of demons and angels and possessions. So far I absolutely love it and I really hope they stick true to the comics. I hope they won't rule out the chain-smoking just to calm viewers down. On a network that shows the Hannibal series, I sincerely doubt that chain-smoking is the thing to worry about when it comes to bad habits. I loved the actual comic art they showed at the end of the first episode too. I can't wait to see where this series is going and I REALLY hope it continues. This series has what Supernatural has lost; a dark, gritty ambiance that makes the hairs on the back of your neck stand up. Definitely worth a watch, especially if you're a DC fan. ","10"
"Constantine",2014-10-27," The darkness is something deep down inside the character, something can't be made up by acting, unfortunately. This is not the Constantine that I know of watching. The actor's quality does not fit the character. The actor does not has the dark charm or a dark sense of humor. The TV show tries so hard to make it  look like  the book but it forgets the essence which is an important part of the character and the stories. I am not going to mention about the accent and clothing in the show. I am sure if the essence is right, those are just minor issues. However, the soul of the show is missing. No matter how hard they try, it is impossible to paint over the emotionless frame. ","1"
"Constantine",2014-10-27," Personally I preferred the Dresden Files--Boo SciFi Channel for canceling anything of worth--Constantine tries fill in but after one episode I don't want to pass too tough a judgment. There is some promise here and the series will probably do better with those who aren't fans of the comic book or the horrible Keanu Reeves film. I like Matt Ryan and he brings a been there, sick of it, demon weary attitude that defines what I would expect of the character. And Charles Halford is OK as Chas Chandler, Constantine's version of  Hrothbert  Bob  of Bainbridge.  The series has good spot following Grim and may find an audience. I'll give it a few more views and report back, ","7"
"Constantine",2014-10-27," Big disappointment!!!!! Such a good script and base to make a good serious syfy show, but instead we got ridiculously handsome Constantine unsuccessfully & inappropriately trying to joke all the time with his sexy accent. The jokes are lame, the show not scary. Is this some kind of a sitcom????? It remind me of Dominion. But in Dominion it's nice to have a look at gorgeous chicks as well as at sexy male Archangels) ...but here we left only with Constantine) People, there is SO few good syfy shows on TV!!!!! Please, stop trying to make funny comedy syfy! It's wrong! Nobody needs it! Please don't ruin this great promising script and idea! Just give the rights to another network!!!! ","1"
"Constantine",2014-10-26," Constantine Why care?? Fifteen minutes in and you haven't gotten a single decent answer to that question.45 min in and your still haven't gotten that answer Why care about Constantine, why care baout any of the other character. They are all equally boring and uninteresting. I guess it is a desperate attempt to surf on the comic/superhero wave. They should have looked harder for a comic to put into film/TV-series. But I guess the big company own all the good ones. Constantine was never all that mainstream, nor all that action packed, that it need a transfer to the TV world. Lest not forget the horrible movie with Keanu reeves, which also was a mistake. There are so many good DC comics out there, why go with the worst one? ","1"
"Constantine",2014-10-26," I've been waiting almost ten years for some sort of sequel or reboot of the first Constantine movie back in 2005. I'm not a big comic book fan and I never knew the character prior to the film, but for what is worth I enjoyed it back in the day and I was hoping for more for a long time.The series starts off on the right note and with a proper rhythm. The protagonist (Matt Ryan) looks ready to undertake a main role. The script isn't the strongest point so far, but it almost never is after just the pilot. I'm sure that in time, it will become much more detailed and interesting. For me personally, it is a very good alternative to the Supernatural series, that keeps taking a dive for the worse with every season passing. I love Supernatural, but that show should have ended 5 seasons ago. Overall, the pilot was cohesive, concentrated and left me curious for more. The scares were also very good with awesome make-up and CGI. If this level of quality can be sustained, I'm sure that we will be on a great ride with John Constantine. ","8"
"Constantine",2014-10-26," I have just finished watching the first episode. I must admit it could have been much much better but I never did like Matt Ryan. He over acts and is very annoying. He loves himself too much I bet he is it because he was cheap to hire as he is not exactly over worked. The effects were good though. I really was hoping that it was a little bit scary but turned out to be pathetic. It is too stupid to even call a horror. It is classed as horror Fantasy. I could not see either one. I am not quite sure what kind of audience this would appeal to. I will give it another chance and watch the second episode and pretend that Matt Ryan is not Matt Ryan but someone else. Maybe, just maybe I might begin to like it. I doubt whether it will lead a second season unless they kill Matt Ryan off and replace him with a monkey or something. ","3"
