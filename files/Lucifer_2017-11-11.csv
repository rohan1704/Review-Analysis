"Lucifer",2017-10-02," Not bad for a Soap Opera title, right? But it happens to be 100% true. Unlike my other  family in Christ,  I can watch a funny send up of the entire religion thing because BEING a full-on believer in Jesus Christ is the religion NOT the churches so-called Christians who seem to easily mix weird words from man and often worship whoever their priest or pastor is instead of believing you can read the Bible with friends and/or family and get the message. Not just GET the message, but also watch fun, entertaining Hollywood nonsense and not stray from the pack!On behalf of the many more sold out Christians, I apologize for those who are brain-washed or generally wobbly about their faith. He gave us FREE WILL. He knows our heart. And He trusts us as we trust Him. Period. It's JUST ENTERTAINMENT (and excellent entertainment at that!). Now to the show. Yes, Tom Ellis and Lauren German are beautiful and I loved every minute of seasons 1 and 2. Bringing in Tom Welling was the networks' most brilliant move so far this season. While other shows are bleeding characters (Hawaii five-0 comes to mind and others), Lucifer is pushing the ante up by throwing my hero for many, many years, Tom Welling, into the mix and who can argue with Superman? The show revolves around Lucifer, DB Woodside his hunky brother, Amenadiel, and Lauren German as the beautiful cop who starts out trying to catch Lucifer as a criminal but let's say a romance evolves, and Lucifer/Amenadiel's mother, played by Tricia Helfer, who I'm not sure is in this season, and Rachel Harris, total comedy relief is Lucifer's therapist.That's pretty much the show - now why I watch it. Simply put: it's pure entertainment. Not heavy, a lot of humor, great ensemble cast, and a far fetched story meant NOT to hurt or help NOT to damage one's own belief. If your faith is that sketchy that what is basically a fantasy show, then I'm afraid you'd better never let your kids watch ANY Disney movie! I live my life out of joy in my faith, not looking over everybody else's shoulder telling them what they should and should not do. And if you all think I'm kidding about being a full on Christian, I will give you my Christian search and final acceptance story including a prophesy gift God gave me during my last operation. NOTHING WILL EVER SHAKE MY FAITH IN GOD AND Jesus Christ. But I am ashamed of many brothers and sisters still in their baby seat, sucking their thumbs, afraid of liberals, afraid of a bad word, afraid of Lucifer! Because I love this show as does my SAVED husband - who actually watched it first 2 years ago and said,  Kathy, you are going to LOVE this show,  to which I responded  HEATHEN! Get thee behind me Satan,  and then here I am, 2 years later writing this. It's one of those  Didn't see THAT coming,  things. I love this show people! Come love it with me! You won't lose your salvation over it! And non-believers, you have no excuse! Also, if you (ABC) Change this winning formula to a darker side of everything: BIG MISTAKE! Don't fix what isn't broken!!

"Lucifer",2017-09-29," I rarely write reviews but I wanted to add some clarification because fans of the comic are too harsh for this TV series. First this is like 1000 times better than the comic. Yes the comic evolves around a deep , complex , rich story. There is two problems with its story a) its far from original (see Spawn) b) the characters are plain boring. Its very difficult in the comic to differentiate one character from the other , they are miserable and they are also miserable... oh did I say they are also miserable. On the other side we have this TV series. In comparison with the comic is pretty much the polar opposite. The story is extremely simple yet very original , the very few characters that is has very well written , interesting and multi dimensional that do not go down the misery stereotypical writing that anything relate to the devil goes usually. Let's get one thing straight the comic is a drama this is a comedy. No its not a cop show. Yeah sure the theme is cop related but in the end, if you take out Lucifer and Chloe this becomes the most boring cop show you ever watched. The murders investigated are far, far ,far from interesting and they don't play any more than a decoration role for the series. The series has more in common with Californication than it has with CSI , Law and Order etc. It should not surprise its made by the same writer. Essentially this polarises on the relation of Lucifer and Chloe, with every character just being there to push the story further. It also does not glorify Satan by any means. The comic does far better job at that actually. Lucifer is NOT himself. This is something that is made clear from episode 1. First because he decides he is fed up with the role of Satan and wants to explore something else. Second and this is the most important is that he finds, again from very early on, that he is physically vulnerable when he is around Chloe. What is implied is also that he emotionally vulnerable when he is around her as well and the more exposed he becomes to her the more vulnerable he becomes. The final blow on the whole  glorifies Satan  comes when we find in Season 2 why Chloe is so special and why the whole story is far from accidental and has little to do with  the power of love  as you would expect in a typical romantic series. In the end this is too binary to be compared to the comic or a typical cop show and too out of character to be blamed for Satan glorification. For the same reasons it cannot even remotely compare to Supernatural which by the way has a lot more common with the comic than this has. Instead this is a remake of the Californication story and its great remake even though much more simple. Mainly because of the extreme amount of layers that the characters have. But mostly because of the chemistry between Chloe and Lucifer. The show like Californication has much more to do with the human condition that is has to do with religion and mythology. Its semi serious look into the human condition from the perspective of very interesting characters with their own flaws and weakness. ","9"
"Lucifer",2017-09-22," What I really love about this show are the one liners that Tom Ellis gets that really make me laugh out loud.What I don't like is the obligatory drop dead gorgeous female detective who just stepped off the catwalk. Seriously she is so pure Lucifer is unable to manipulate her like he does every other human, He can also get shot when he's near her, well not in the pilot when he takes half dozen without any ill effects but by the 4th episode he's no longer immortal, that is simply stupid. OK so they want to keep up the fact that he is the devil from her but for how long? So why do American producers always put these dolly birds in these parts? I wouldn't care if they cast someone overweight and less good looking as long as they can act the part.So for that reason I've knocked a couple of stars off. Sure it is yet another buddy cop show as some of the negative reviewers have stated. However what can you do new these days? So the elements that make any show a success or failure rest on the characters and the actors who play them, Tom Ellis is simply wonderful and I am so glad he used an English accent (Despite being Welsh)instead of a cod American one.

"Lucifer",2017-09-16," I stumbled across Lucifer by accident, but was hooked immediately. It's one of those shows that you can keep binge-watching and never get tired. The plot is interesting and each episode builds up nicely to a storyline to keep you coming back for more. Can't wait for Season 3. My wife also got hooked after I recommended watching it. ","10"
"Lucifer",2017-09-07," I hated the first season because the story was disjointed and the humor was borderline. But season two improved, and this series is worth getting more seasons if the comedy writing holds up. I gave it a generous 8, but I can understand why some people hate this series and I don't have contempt for their viewpoint. When viewer comments were allowed on IMDb, a lot of arguing took place about this series, but it deserves to be seen and the fans deserve more episodes. But it is an acquired taste. ","8"
"Lucifer",2017-09-03," 8,3/10? Really? Are people really this easily pleased? That is...disappointing. Because what we have with  Lucifer  is a below average police procedural with a cheap gimmick. Nothing unusual there, that's usually how those kind of TV-shows work. But most of those are called out on it. For some reason, this one is being outrageously praised for its shortcomings.The titular character of  Lucifer Morningstar  (as he outright tells just about everyone he meets, with all the class and mystique of a Las Vegas street performer who's off his meds) is how the devil would be, as imagined by the least imaginative person on earth. He's predictable, vulgar and cheesy with essentially no REAL self-awareness. Oh, the show pretends that they're hamming it up in a fun, ironic way. But it's pretty obvious they're just churning out another barely mediocre procedural with as little effort as possible.The sad thing is, I would probably have enjoyed the concept if it has been executed with some actual talent and genuine panache. They could have played with the idea of the devil walking the street of L.A., solving crimes and it would have been a fun little diversion. But unfortunately, they forgot to bring the subtlety and quality writing. So instead we're left with this shrine to the lowest common denominator. ","3"
"Lucifer",2017-09-01," I have barely seen better written shows than this one. The dialogues and scripting is superb. The story about heaven and hell, god, the devil and other angels is rich, interesting and there is so much content, that still hasn't really seen a good movie or TV show adaption. This show does an excellent job in delivering interesting approaches to the main questions people ask themselves, when they are thinking about life. Is there a heaven, or hell. What is the devil and how is he like. How does god and the earth, angels and demons and all this stuff connect and work? The bible doesn't really give answers to supernatural beings and the story before creation of earth..Choosing LA (the city of sins) as the main location makes perfect sense. As well as showing the devil making trouble on earth. Amenadiel, Uriel, Mazekeen and Azrael are interesting variations of the classic angels Raphael, Gabriel and Michael. I don't know whether this happened out of respect, or out of creativity, but it works very well. The situations and dialogues happening because of the confrontation of human beings and supernatural ones are hilarious and interesting to watch. This show offers so many likable and interesting characters it is a pleasure to watch. ","9"
"Lucifer",2017-07-25," shoots in Vancouver. it would be so easy to move it to L.A. and actually shoot in the city it's set in. can't watch it for that reason alone. evidently they intended to shoot there but only for the money are they shooting out of country. return it to Los Angeles, and might be worth watching.

"Lucifer",2017-07-16," Based on characters created by Neil Gaiman, Sam Kieth and Mike Dringenberg, this series follows Lucifer, the original fallen angel, who has become dissatisfied with his life in hell. After abandoning his throne and retiring to Los Angeles, Lucifer indulges in his favorite things (women, wine and song) -- until a murder takes place outside of his upscale nightclub. For the first time in billions of years, the murder awakens something unfamiliar in Lucifier's soul that is eerily similar to compassion and sympathy. Lucifer is faced with another surprise when he meets an intriguing homicide detective named Chloe, who appears to possess an inherent goodness -- unlike the worst of humanity, to which he is accustomed. Suddenly, Lucifer starts to wonder if there is hope for his soul. ","10"
"Lucifer",2017-07-13," Their are sooo many reasons why this new TV show should not work.For starters, the religious aspects of it. Then you have the done- so-many-times-before teaming up with the police factor. Then you have the typical sexist issues relevant in this show. And so on, and so on. BUT, it did work, and very well so!From the first episode, I had my doubts, but you couldn't help enjoying each character, especially Tom Ellis playing the role of the devil. Combining all of these characters, considering their respective religious earthly roles, then adding the factor of solving crimes, was actually very entertaining.Setting this show in Los Angeles and its associated lifestyle/nightlife was a huge plus.As the show progressed, I was curious to see what more can happen. Well, a lot did, and it was all executed perfectly.Props to the writers and director for finally taking many clichés, and bundling them up, mixing them around and creating a hit TV show!I hope this show keeps renewing its seasons, and look forward to see what happens next!It's a 9/10 from me!

"Lucifer",2017-05-31," Never in my life have i written a review but this just deserves my full support. I liked the first series and could see so much potential for its future and yes they came up with a far better second series, gratz to the producers, actors and all involved, Please please carry on the good work.Also just have to add Tricia Helfer is HOT. Shame she won't be back or will she ????? ","10"
"Lucifer",2017-05-30," ** May contain a Spoiler or two **It may well be another cop show but Lucifer is so much more. You will laugh out loud, cry sometimes and feel  sympathy for the Devil . As a non practicing Catholic, I see this show brings both the good and bad out in all of the characters. You will fall for Detective Decker's (Lauren German) just as you will be rooting for Lucifer (Tom Ellis) to as well. This is mostly an adult show but their are some fun moments with little Trixie (who is not a hooker - see the pilot) and even funnier moments with the Doctor (Rachael Harris). I love this show....watch it....give it a chance....make a deal with the devil!!  Id rather laugh with the sinners than cry with the saints, The sinners are much more fun  ","10"
"Lucifer",2017-05-19," I love Lucifer Series, it is absolutely brilliant! it got my attention from the firs episode. I love the way realty and mythology mix in a ironic and humorous way. As a fantasy fan i can say... this is the best I've ever watched! And the cast ... well it is perfectly picked! With every episode it gets more, and more interesting. ","10"
"Lucifer",2017-05-06," hmm.. short review of my life: im dentist, my father died when I was 10, I have met best woman on the world and i enjoy in my life every single day. I was angry when God took my father from me so i stopped to believe in him, did i get the answer to my prayers? No. After some time i start to believe again that there is something, still believing deep inside me that is God, and i met great woman, and she is really gift from God. Everyday i go to dental clinic, because that is place where i work. Everyday i cause little pain to my patients, is that what i want? no. i don't enjoy in their pain but job need to be done. everyday i hearing  i hate dentist . Do you see patern?Its hypocritically to judge Devil to have different opinion from God when we (humans) have free will. So at the end i have question for you all, is Devil bad guy or had that kind of work? :P ","10"
"Lucifer",2017-04-27," I read recently of the armies of trolls attempting to discredit movies/series, some which haven't been released yet?? Looking at the negative reviews I cant help thinking Lucifer is clearly being targeted. I remember looking at some of the posts on the Lucifer Facebook wall and am completely blown out at the 160K likes to some posts in under 24 hours. We're avid watchers. For the most part its almost juvenile, utterly silly and certainly no classic but gosh do we laugh and enjoy the antics. At some level it reminds me of the Beverly Hillbillies and look at how that fill in grew. The negative reviews appear to be more about politics than entertainment. The  ask your mother  comment in Ep 1 had us bellyaching for months, the  Oops  response to killing Lucifers mum was yet another month of mimicking and laughter. I'm delighted to see those attempting to prevent us from enjoying this utterly silly but brilliant piece of entertainment fail. ","8"
"Lucifer",2017-04-16," Very funny series, regularly laughing because of the remarks of Mr Morningstar, and don't forget the very beautiful Maze.... Of course it's sometimes unreal, of course it's sometimes nearly a children TV show, of course it's not perfect. But it works, we love it ! Now watching the 3d season. I'm desperately waiting for the next episode ! ","8"
"Lucifer",2017-04-14," This is so much intense and made me live up the moment i use to watch this as a time passing moment but i am so much captivated by its scenes and soundtrack i am now growing up on it...and really i am suggesting people to watch Lucifer and waiting for the upcoming seasons....its emotional, dramatic and action.... i would really wish to see more coming out of it...they have done a fabulous job good work guys..and lots of love...

"Lucifer",2017-04-09," Turn the Devil into the most generic, cringe-inducing man-child, pair him up with a sidekick lady as intriguing as a toothpaste tube, add some juvenile humor, LA landscapes, fancy clubs and overused songs - and you get Lucifer, a product so lame and uninspiring one has to wonder why did they agree to shoot it in the first place. Oh, and I didn't even talk about the biblical aspect in that short summary, did I? That's because if you expect the philosophical stuff about humans and angels, fathers and sons, sin, punishment and redemption, you have the wrong address. And if you're here for absurd dark humor, fresh and weird story lines, and unconventional take on one of the most enthralling characters the mankind has come up with, don't waste your time.  Boring  is not the first word that comes to mind when thinking about the Devil, but it describes Fox' Lucifer pretty neatly. ","1"
"Lucifer",2017-04-02," This show is amazing! It is my favorite show of all time and can't believe that season one has only four stars and season two has only three. At least that's what Hulu says for star ratings. I hope they make a season three and many more after that. If I could rate it, I would definitely rate it a full five stars. ","10"
"Lucifer",2017-03-24," After watching all of the first season of this show, I have to say that I still am not quite sure if I really like it or not. I will note that I have never read the graphic novel upon which this series is loosely based, so my opinion of the show is based on how it is as a stand alone idea. On one hand, there are certain things about this series that I enjoy. Most of the actors bring decent performances to their roles, and Tom Ellis as Lucifer is pretty entertaining to watch. Lucifer is funny and his existential crisis is an amusing subplot. He's also kind of an asshole with chronic foot-in-mouth, but that's part of his character. Chloe is also likable and I'd have to say she's probably the main reason I finished watching the entire season, because I enjoy her character and the family drama she has going on. The uneasy relationship Chloe has with Lucifer is another point that makes the show interesting at times. Contrary to some reviewers, I actually enjoy that Lucifer is kind of a decent guy struggling with the conflict between his perceived nature and the person that he actually wants to be. The show is not without its faults, though. In fact, it has plenty. The writing is mediocre and from other reviews I've read it apparently deviates heavily from the source material. The other main issue is that it's yet another run of the mill police procedural with a supernatural spin (many echoes here of shows like Brimstone, Forever Knight, Moonlight, Reaper, etc). There isn't much originality here at all and it really drags the show down. If the producers had tried to stick even a little more to the graphic novel then maybe this show could have been something special, but what we got instead is a fairly dumbed-down rehash of a story that's been told by Hollywood many times before. Many of the episode plot lines are shallow and predictable, and like so many other shows these days it tries too hard to be trendy and hip, which detracts from the overall theme. Lucifer as a series could benefit greatly from a little more darkness and a lot less flashy LA club culture. Speaking of LA, I think it's a terrible setting for the show (though, having not read the graphic novel, I don't know if this is where it's meant to be set?). They could have had this show set in a number of different cities and it would have been a better choice, in my opinion. Despite the complaints I have with this show, I still watched a whole season and I think I may stick around for Season 2, but if there are no improvements to the writing or the other less favorable elements I mentioned above, I don't believe I will continue watching in the long run. This show could have been great in the right hands, but currently it's awfully mediocre and in need of a serious overhaul. I do see some promise in the premise, however, so I'm not ready to write it off just yet. ","5"
"Lucifer",2017-03-19," Lucifer is some kind of politically correct new man, a so-called metrosexual. That premise can never work. He has to be bad-ass, offensive, nasty and un-PC. No actor can make devil-as-campy-metrosexual work because it doesn't make sense and is not in any way interesting or fun. He is watchable, at least at first, until his character becomes irritating, but it's not his fault. The same actor would be great in a bad-ass role. Instead the show demands him to be camp and rather pathetic. OK, so Lucifer is a total wet blanket. What are we left with? The female cop. What does he see in her? She's as interesting as a cardboard box. And has zero sex appeal. Also, she sees things that are impossible, comments that they are impossible, but then does not seem curious. Oh, this guy is obviously supernatural, but I'll just sweep that to one side. That is, of course, insanely unintelligent. Then you have the female psychologist - yawn. And the pointless naggy brother angel character, an affirmative-action hire presumably. And the sassy female angel Hell girl, who is also pretty pointless, she's there to protect the Devil? So even his mortality creates no suspense. Oh dear. I watched the first 6 episodes, and then watched the last episode of season two - mostly skipping the many slow bits. The show is dull dull dull and dumb as HELL. Avoid! The show is insipid play-it-safe nonsense, a kind of safe-area for idiots. No guts. No evil. ","3"
"Lucifer",2017-02-20," I found this show by accident, and I love it!! The show is full of quick wit and comedy moments, but underneath its full of drama and the love the main characters have for each other is refreshing. Its also a change to see the main character portrayed in a softer light rather than the evil side. ","10"
"Lucifer",2017-02-18," I'm in love with this show. It started very good, season one was at the end excellent. Now, in the middle of season 2, I feel obligated to write this Review, because, this is one of the best shows out there at this moment (end of winter 2017). Actors are great (everyone), screenplay too, but atmosphere and comedy in this show are truly unique. So, people, watch this show, it's renewed for season 3, and I hope it will be in menu season to come. It's intelligent and very entertaining to watch, so do it. ","10"
"Lucifer",2017-02-16," Got to be the best thing on TV at the moment. Funny and gripping. Tom Ellis plays Lucifer brilliantly and Lauren German is excellent as his Detective Partner/Love Interest. The whole show is a breath of fresh air and unlike anything else currently being aired.Please make a season 3 ","10"
"Lucifer",2017-02-15," I like it. He is charming to look at. I like the little plot twist. The therapist is hilarious. I also like supernatural and was looking for another show that is slightly similar and BOOM this show popped up (along with my friend telling me how its really nice to watch). I was hoping to binge watch the series but since its still going strong Id keep up with the weekly releases. Suggestion: Please let the mother of lucifer go. She annoys me. ","9"
"Lucifer",2017-02-12," Terrifically watchable. How on earth did they do it!?Lucifer should -absolutely- not be on my list of musts. Yet, I haven't missed a single episode. And then can't wait for the next one. What!? This one has really grabbed hold of and kept my interest. And I'm easily bored and hyper-critical, very very few shows manage to meet my standards. This plots been done so many times before, in both television and movies, that it should be growing moss(even the twists are worn out). Though,I have to say the show has a partly episodic nature(of course), it does have a good, strong story-line that consistently continues throughout.Characters are so clichéd, it's criminal. And I'm hooked on every single one's ongoing story line.The way they've tried to show us Lucifer's inner thoughts,feelings, inner struggles, is an equally trite and familiar character. A lazy writer's narrative plot tool. But I love it, can't wait see how that subplot continues. The main actor's British accent sounds unbelievable fake. It's utterly charming. (This one was a mystery at first. I knew that Tom Ellis was from Britain - what was going on? After listening to a few interviews and hearing his real voice - he's just really hamming it up more than a few notches for the show. ( Some might think it's because he actually has a Welsh accent.But he was just born in Wales, he didn't grow up there) The set designs are beyond cheesy. And yet, their quality is obviously very high - it's easy to see that money and attention was spent here.I could go on and on...---I gave this an 8, but honestly I'm not sure what to rate it. This show has me completely baffled. Why do I like it so much? ","8"
"Lucifer",2017-02-12," I don't usually write reviews but I came here to write one for the people that want to watch Lucifer but are not sure if it's worth it. First thing's first, if you're a religious fanatic and can't set religious beliefs aside to just watch a show it's just better not to. The show is somewhat trying to make you sympathize with the devil so if you can't watch the show as just a show, don't even watch it. Okay, now to the actual review. I'm going to try to make this pretty short (hopefully) and say that Tom Ellis does a really great job at portraying the devil in a way that you wouldn't normally think the devil would actually act like considering you heard all your life he's all the bad in the world. Now a little bit about the plot before I go into more detail about the characters in the show. The plot, I'm going to say that it it's the basic cop movies. There is a case in every episode and they solve it until the end of the episode. Now before you stop reading this review and don't watch the show because of it let me tell you a little bit about the characters in this show. The characters in this show are really unique and setting aside the actual cop cases (cause they are just the means by which the characters evolve) the story is really interesting. The character development keeps you going cause they are in a really unique setting and it keeps you wanting to see what ends up happening. There are many turns and unexpected developments too to keep you interested and believe me, it's working. \Having finished the second season (well... 13 episodes are released at the time I'm writing this) I'm left wanting more and really curious as to what happens next. I've finished it 3 days ago and I'm still thinking about what's going to happen. (not many shows or movies make we think about what happens next or of what just happened for days after I finished it) Lucifer, from my point of view, is a show really worth the time. It's nicely written, nicely recorded/edited, really good music and add on top of all of that some really unique and heavy scenes that make you really invested in the characters and empathize with them. Give it a try, I'm confident you'll like it. ","10"
"Lucifer",2017-02-08," To be honest I never did any sort of rating or stuff before, but I really like Lucifer. Actually I never read the comics so I had no clue what it's about when I started to watch and maybe I got everything wrong...but I like to imagine that even the devil struggles with human life and all the things that come with it and although the already kind of fell out of heaven, he is also falling a lot of times on earth but still doesn't give up to figure it out and stands up and tries again. It totally weird to imagine the devil running around on earth solving crimes but I like it and I really like to know how everything works out :-) ","10"
"Lucifer",2017-02-05," I mean hey , when you have to deal with the unnamed one, and to start like it, you better write a review , just to have God on your side when the time comes... OK , enough with blabber ... This show as per summary , is balancing really well the original main subject of Lucifer having a break , and the supposed usual subject of crims ( Aussie slang ) hunted by the usual coopers and detectives. But... is really like that simple... the usual and the original are really a good intertwine, the writing is really good, almost to the  Boston Legal  quality, the acting very close to the   Two and a half...  and all is helped with a real touch of mastery by the directions. Ah, and how can i forget the top of the tops of musical selection ! I gave it a 9 just because Fox wants it canceled . Do not do that Fox mates, just remember the faith of the   Firefox   ; people loves it after the cancellation . Hence the movie feature. So keep it running ! ","9"
"Lucifer",2017-02-05," I have been a fan of the supernatural since I was a young boy. This show is utterly ridiculous. A  trying to be funny  Lucifer??? Lucifer is supposed to be the king of hell, dark, demonic, pure evil. I've never seen a Lucifer that smiled so much and in a good mood all the freakin' time. Joking around all the time, blah blah blah.Bring back the real evil. The blood thirsty, nasty, black, destructive demons that we all love in the supernatural realm. This show is an insult to the supernatural genre. Hollywood needs a reboot, desperately. All these shows that keep getting pumped out without even caring how good they are. Seriously, have you ever seen sooooo many horrible shows that come out now?? Time to slow it down and come out with a few decent shows. Where have all the good times gone? ","3"
"Lucifer",2017-01-02," Sure.. Basically is a kind of B.. maybe C TV series.. Very Common crime plots stolen from 80's shows, a wild drunken vision of heavenly hierarchies adapted to arrange a story who went very far from the original path and has many weird parts, forced to give air to frequently empty moments. Often a bad air. The heart of everything in my opinion it is the main character. O well.. I like characters like Maze or the Doc, but they stay in the background, are their role.. the real heart, the reason why this series stays up is Tom. His manners, those little spicy jokes and his English accent, all this make the main character of this series something unique, fascinating as only the devil can be. Not horrible or dangerous, but a little naughty Hellboy, relaxed in a world of noisy, imperfects, strange, faulty and.. intriguing humans. Seems he just wont to play a role game on this poor earth but maybe.. secretly he wish to be a human.. to wash his bones into humanity, to search a place in which found what he missed in hell, just a little of heat, that heat that just only the humans can feel.Dunno why but i just can't wait to see the rest.. maybe is a demonic spell. ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-12-25," I started watching this out of pure boredom with relatively low expectations. Seemed like it was going to be another lame, cheesy take on a supernatural story. I was wrong. Okay...it may be a little bit cheesy but it's extremely entertaining and the writers do a great job of playing its strengths such as clever one liners and well played humor.By end of the first episode Tom Ellis will have you completely charmed. Devilish indeed. There aren't many things you won't let the man get away with because he just does it all so well. No other actor could take this material and run with it so brilliantly. Then just when you think he can't get any better Tom jumps on the piano with beautiful performances, some with and without vocals, of very classy choices such as  Sinner Man ,  Unforgiven ,  Knockin on Heaven's Door , and  All Along the Watchtower . The man has the voice of an angel, pun intended.Alongside Tom Ellis is Lauren German. I wasn't particularly familiar with her prior to Lucifer and that was my loss. She plays the more serious half of the duo. Despite being the  bad cop  of the two, German is extremely clever, sexy, and quite funny. Her smile absolutely lights up the screen.The casting is strong in this one. Mazikeen, portrayed by Lesley Ann Brandt, is a fun and devious demon. Kevin Alejandro does a great job as well playing one of the less gratified roles (in my opinion). D.B. Woodside as Amenadiel and Rachel Harris as Linda are also quite remarkable. Ten stars on this aspect.In this decade ruled by giants such as Game of Thrones, The Walking Dead, and the spectacular new Westworld, it's hard to believe this PG-13 rated show can hold its own. Admittedly, I would've liked to see Lucifer without the restraints of the rating holding back all the real life profanity and adult content that we've been accustomed to in recent years. I'm pleased to say that does little to dim the talent and enjoyment of this show. The story holds your attention, the production value is superb, and the performances are top notch. I hope to see many more seasons to come. ","9"
"Lucifer",2016-12-22," I won't go into the story because it's basically self explanatory except for Lucifer's relationship with a female cop! The problem with Lucifer is he looses his abilities, which there doesn't seem to have many, when he is in the presence of Chloe, the Botox ridden co star of the show! I am in disbelief how any producer could cast Lauren German when she can't move her face at all! If you mute the TV you would have no idea what's going on! I couldn't figure out why I hated her acting so much until I realized she is both a terrible actor and has lost the ability to show emotion! I really enjoy the main character of Lucifer and his cohorts and find they are the only thing keeping this show going! The story line is full of holes and stupid scenarios so you have to retire your brain while watching 'Lucifer' but the occasional humorous quip from Lucifer keeps me watching. I really wish the writers would add some realistic characters like a psychiatrist who doesn't fall apart when confronted with Lucifer true self! Personally, I would be fascinated with Lucifer and would have many questions but the psychiatrist nearly has a breakdown and doesn't have any questions! A little realism would help shows like this! I am a little surprised Lucifer has been allowed more seasons considering how lame it is but i suppose with the numerous terrible shows around makes Lucifer more attractive to viewers! I would give the show a few more stars if Lauren German wasn't in it and not so annoying and replaced with someone who could actually act, but that isn't happening! ","5"
"Lucifer",2016-12-19," This show has a fun premise and I started watching it to see how the character Lucifer would be interpreted for the TV-watching public. In my opinion, he should be sinfully delicious. So my number-one gripe is I just don't like the main character or the actor playing him, for the following reasons: 1. Too whiny. At least once per episode he whines,  Detective!  I'm no satanist, but I don't picture the Lord of Darkness as a whiny eight- year-old. This reminds me of my students (when I was teaching grade two) saying,  But, miss!  when I wouldn't let them eat candies at morning snack. 2. Too ambivalent. They have had a lot of opportunities for the Prince of Darkness to really get all red-eye- glow burned-face furious, and really make the most of those neat special effects from the first episode, but when this devil becomes enraged he just seems kind of peeved. 3. Not really that attractive. I get that they were going for a Pierce Brosnan James Bond-type, but Tom Ellis does not ooze sexuality, no matter how many overpriced dapper suits and silk shirts with the top two buttons open they dress him in. Again, he looks a woman in the eye with an air of ambivalence. And he's got a bit of a small chin. 4. Rather powerless. Really? Beelzebub, the Evil One, the King of Babylon has the power to make some people admit what they really want, by asking them what they really want? Oh, and he can make a coin with satanic symbols on it float in mid air and spin a little bit. I think it would at least be cooler if he just had to look at you and you admitted your deepest darkest secrets, but then it would be too easy to solve murder cases, wouldn't it? And it irritates him so much that this detective is impervious to his power (also difficult to believe, since he is the Lord of the Underworld and all that) that he starts following her around like a puppy... or maybe an eight year old...Other problems that get in the way of this being the really great show it has the potential to be: 1. Detective Chloe Decker has zero personality. At least give Satan someone interesting to follow around and whine at. 2. Detective Dan Espinoza (Detective Douche) has zero personality. 3. There is no way that child is the product of Detective Chloe and Detective Douche. So who's the real father? Oops, was that a spoiler? Or did the casting directors flunk out of high school biology and miss the part about genetics? I know this isn't a show about science, it's a show about a very weakly portrayed superstition, but this little casting screw-up makes the viewing public who DID go to high school feel like it's aimed at a somewhat stupider demographic.It's kind of entertaining, but I don't think I'll be upgrading my cable package to get access to future seasons.

"Lucifer",2016-12-09," I had low expectations for this series, and TV in general. Now I am hooked. I had to order the full first season on DVD to see how the characters had evolved. Tom Ellis is absolutely perfect for the role. PERFECT. It is impossible to ignore his good looks, but adding in his humor and unexpected display of various emotions, makes this show a winner. I hope the writers are able to continue this delightful mix of good and evil. The dialogue is quick and so very clever. The series is not for the strictly religious - it IS just a TV series after all - but it has served the purpose of creating meaningful discussions between those who believe and those who may be unsure. If you care to look at just one episode before you  pass judgment  - watch A Priest Walks Into A Bar from the first season. It's worth the time. Enjoy! ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-12-07," Tom Ellis acting is the best, Lauren German acting is so great and the chemistry between them is perfect. Lesley-Ann (Mazikeen) is also a good actress for this role !!! Probably one of the best series ever.Congratulions to the director and the other actors. The story is very good and the main actors make the scenario explode. For the religious people out there, don't be afraid to watch this show, me too when i first saw  Lucifer  i thought this gonna be bad and blasphemous, but it's cool and OK to watch, nothing to be afraid or bad about God. So it's a must watch show, for the people of all ages and specially for people with a good taste of living and gentleman's manners. ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-12-05," After watching a couple of episodes, I couldn't take it anymore. One dimensional characters, noticeably thin plot, very forced situations, and mediocre acting. Not to mention the repeated scenes. How many times is he going to ask her about why she is so different than the other humans and why isn't she fascinated with him?Many of the scenes and character's reactions to what happens to them are pretty unnatural. For example, when Lucifer is confronting the preacher on the street, he says that the preacher is a charlatan, that he doesn't believe in what he is preaching. Now, a natural reaction from the preacher would be to defend himself and deny this, since it's what brings him money. But in the series, he asks in front of many people:  Yeah, so what are you gonna do about it? . It was almost painful to watch.There are many other examples, but English isn't my native language, and I'm done wasting my time on this. ","2"
"Lucifer",2016-12-02," I've rated movies and series here for at least ten years, but have NEVER written a review.....until now. NO, this show didn't start out great and it is certainly NOT for everyone. It was silly from the get-go (and often still is) and the acting was grating at times. But there was just something about it. I decided to give it a chance and am so SO glad I did. I'm totally hooked on it as are many people I know. Tom Ellis is an AWESOME Lucifer. He IS the entire show. He takes some of the cheesiest lines and makes them sound like Shakespearan comedy gold. I'm so invested in his 'story', I'm actually embarrassed. I haven't enjoyed a show this much since Buffy/Angel/Battlestar/etc. Again, this show is far from perfect. But it isn't TRYING to be! Some of the greatest TV comes when you don't try TOO hard. Even Lauren German (Chloe) is starting to grow on me....not crazy about her 'acting'. But she's getting better which is what we all should strive for in life. The other characters are REALLY strong. The psychiatrist, Rachael Harris, is FANTABULOUS! Lucifer's bro is the perfect angst riddled fallen angel. Even Chloe's ex is beginning to grow on me. I am so relieved this show's been renewed, I'd have been devastated to only get one season. Sleeper hits like this don't come around all that often, even these days with yet another 'golden age of television'. ","9"
"Lucifer",2016-12-02," I simply love this show! It is amusing, funny, easygoing and lighthearted. The last thing I want to spend my time on is watching gloomy, sad, depressing, so-called realistic  entertainment  that is not entertaining at all. The cast is brilliant and convincing. And they are getting even better with each episode. What Tom is doing with Lucifer is pure magic. I also imagine that he has to have quite a lot of courage to take and create such a devilish character, especially considering that major part of his family is very religious. Thumbs up for him. And for everyone else who in any way contributes to making Lucifer happen. I hope and pray:D for many many more episodes. ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-11-28," I was never a fan of crime shows, but now watching Lucifer and how they bring a whole new twist to them is the best. Lucifer brings the seriousness of finding the murderer, while the silliness and comedy you don't see in a normal crime show. Its refreshing to see a new side. I always re-watch episodes on Hulu while waiting for the new one. This is my new favorite show and I enjoy watching it with my whole family. I love that they are building up Lucifer and Chloe's relationship more. I hope to see it blossom into something more than it currently is. The fact that each character faces some kind of personal problem that always loops around and ties back around to either one or more other characters is great. It shows that they are not leaving that character out there all alone. ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-11-23," You mean Lucifer? As in Lucifer Morningstar really? And this is the best plot and/or story line you can come up with? This is supposed to be completely most evil, crime and horror series ever but all you could see happen is Lucifer helping out in solving criminal cases and being nice to mortals.? He cant be nice, he cant be friendly, he can't be so soft and kind like you portrayed him to be in the series. Should we always have to see series about crime solving and sort week in week out.? This was supposed to be different.I've watched the first two episodes of the series and I can say that I'm very disappointed .I'm not sure if this would be any good but I'm most certainly not intrigued. It's not well written, not exciting and definitely not charming. The show is so very boring to my likening 2/10 for me ","2"
"Lucifer",2016-11-19," This show is so boring and cliché you can replace Lucifer with anything and the show would still work out.I haven't fully read the comic yet but comparing the two.I see no resemblance between the characters/story..etc.On one side we have douche bag,boring,man child who has intellect of an 10 year old and is acting as if he is experiencing emotions for the first time, so he needs an even dumber psychologist to tell him what to do with himself.But on the other side we have (Comic book) we have devil who is billions of years old fallen from heaven. Rebeling against god and ends up trying to free himself from God's creation...etcI mean this crappy show is 99% cop drama which is unbelievably bad brings nothing to the show.Rest wanna be fiction story but never starts.Every character in this show is stupid fool who don't have any long term goals.They exist within that one episode and that's it.They are shallow as they can get.I mean the series is called Lucifer yet it is all about Chloe who is supposed to be second main character yet she keeps taking all show but she is so boring i would rather watch paint dry i swear.So far the series has go to season 2 episode 9 probably but they still don't have any plot.Wow this writing just sucks.Idiots couldn't do one thing right and they had the already done source material. ","1"
"Lucifer",2016-11-19," And yeah this is what the result is not an 8/10 but 0/10 because I could not select 0 I gave it a 1 Just my opinion or what I think about these series 1.For me it is Lucifer the gay man because he is acting like he is Gay no offense. 2.The cop thing investigations pff give me a break I hate these things 3.Let see what do we have CSI CSI NY bla bla bla maybe we can make CSI GAY Or CSI EU No serious I don't understand they keep investing in that. But maybe there are more people loving crap these days and spend money for it. We had to many of this!!! it's turning into boring Why does people keep voting and telling people that it is good when it is NOT. The result is not correct anymore I was hoping this was good but  hell  it wasn't. Shame for series that have the same result 8/10 maybe IMDb need to change the others to 18/20 because it is no fair for others that perform better ","1"
"Lucifer",2016-11-16," Let's start off with the fact that I am not religious at all and I did not read the comic, so I am able to review this title quite objectively. Lucifer starts of as a quite exciting detective with a little twist, you won't see your average cop duo with an uninteresting story line. In a way, it is actually a bit similar to the show Sherlock. The main character Lucifer is brilliant, his character makes constant references to heaven/hell/religion on a different and funny manner. The fact that he is the only British person in the show (so far) emphasizes the fact that he is 'different' to say the least. Since he is the devil he has some benefits that come with it like being immortal and being able ask for someones deepest desires. These powers, however, have no effect on his partner, a female cop and ex actress. While this idea sounds great, the actress for Chloe could have been played by someone else. Her personality and face are sometimes distracting during intense scenes. The main story line is simple, but interesting and enjoyable. I like the fact that they do not put a label on religion, they do not criticize religion nor do they praise it. They do, however, make the occasional jokes with a religious background like when Lucifer is asked whether Lucifer Morningstar is a real name or stage name, Lucifer replies:  God given I'm afraid . It is these kinds of jokes that make the show the brilliant show it is. I would like to give this show an 8.5, but I am forced to compensate for the sheer amount of negative reviews for religious reasons. ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-11-16," I liked this show until it proved it could be just as political as the hacks that are starring in the rest of Hollywood shows. I am starting to read more, TV is being shut off. I will not spend my money and support leftist liberal progressive communists in our shows. Writers are all liberals and i hate their message because they are the ones spewing hate these days. Will no longer watch this show LUCIFER because your writers and actors show their ignorance. I can no longer support this show, and the actors saying the lines that the writer spew show they are not very bright because they will say any stupid thing that is written for them. Lucifer you have ruined my day, and if you show on Fox or CBS, I will be canceling my subscription to these networks too. ","1"
"Lucifer",2016-11-15," As a big fan of the comics I was very disappointment to hear that the TV adaptation was going to do away with pretty much everything I liked in the comics in favor of... Another cop show.But... It grew on me, you know? Despite using the cliché murder mysteries as a framing device, the focus is still on the Lucifer's shenanigans and relationships, what makes for a show that is very funny and refreshing. Though most of it feels like an endless party, there are even some genuine emotional moments here and there. Even the clichéd cop mysteries is done competently, if not greatly. To be honest, I never expect great things from this show when it comes up, but I do expect to have one hell of a good time. Pun intended. ","8"
"Lucifer",2016-11-11," I missed the complete first season and got to season 2 after the first episode. I certainly wish to see more of it. Lucifer has left Hell to come to our world as a detective fighting crime. Now, if that's not a new idea, I don't know what is. And the devil is a good guy after all, and charming to boot. Of course, dealing with God, his mom and his numerous siblings is quite entertaining. I bet he would have a much harder time composing with various religions on Earth. And who would want to bother anyway? Lucifer is a free loader, but one who doesn't care about material goods. He's enjoying himself, dishing out punishments while humans are still alive. That must be quite a change for him. I can't help but wish he came to Washington to punish rotten politicians, but alas, he got hooked by a pretty detective in the City of Angels. One good, honest cop, he watches over. Lucifer is always a bit frantic. God is always on his tail, so to speak, trying to derail his pleasure train by using humans as pawns for is eternal fight against the Dark Prince. Quite a change of perspective and a refreshing one, even if the whole concept is ludicrous. The good devil also speak with a British accent. Somehow, nobody could believe the show would work with an American accent. I guess the Devil works in mysterious ways too. Lucifer is simply the best show I've seen on TV since «Dead Like Me». ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-11-03," When I first started watching the series, I must admit it was out of curiosity as there were controversies when it was initially aired. I mean, I was wondering how they could possibly make a hero out of  Lucifer  who's BAD NEWS, right? Well, the first season didn't impress much. It was entertaining to a certain degree without any offensive indications to less fanatically religious sectors, from my point of view. They didn't make him your every day hero but ironically despite Lucifer having selfish intentions & ideologies his non-heroic acts turn out to be quite the heroics! The intensity & chemistry between the actors have improved tremendously in Season 2 and the script has definitely improved! Watch this without skepticism and you'll probably enjoy a light hearted action, crime series and remember, this a metaphorically intended show! ","8"
"Lucifer",2016-11-03," The best part of this show is that it is contained with lots of twists,turns and excitement.It keeps you focused all the time and curiosity for this show increases time by time.The taste of this will never let you be unsatisfied by it.This show has got lots of potential to stay in competition.To me this episode (The Monster) by far was the best till date as when Lucifer shows what exactly he is? It was a thrill which literally carried goosebumps on my body when the face of hidden Lucifer is shown. I was tumbled at this moment of time as it was an awestruck moment. Her mother is one suspicious character. One important thing is the characters are slowly and steadily being revealed which indicates there's much more to come.My Rating for this show is a Total 10 Just waiting for the next episode. ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-11-02," Whatever it says.. I love Lucifer.. This show is entertaining to me because it's light and somehow funny. And why do i need to compare this character with other devils on other series? He's witty & sarcasm makes me smirk. He's quite banters with Chloe, and his phobic with little kid ( Chloe's daughter ) makes me laugh.. and   Not bad meaning bad, you know ?   ( BTW,i'd taken this from CL, which her song has featured in opening of episode 5 season 1). Well.. all of us has the demon side and try to tame it in our life, just like this Lucifer. I can understand why they add new woman cop character, Chloe really need a friend, ha ha.. Good job for the writers an all PD's line. Please keep on with this show. ","9"
"Lucifer",2016-10-23," i don't know why this has received such high ratings.The story is basically the devil goes to LA meets a female detective,he quite fancy's her and proceeds to assist her in solving her cases.The first episode was good but it quickly became clear that from then on in each episode was basically the same, detective has new crime devil helps her solve it.As a sub plot the devil appears to becoming human and his assistant doesn't understand why hes not being bad .I watched the first 6 episodes and then came to the conclusion each episode was same old same old.Its a detective serious with the devil as a detective.This review is based on me watching the first 6 episodes in season one,so perhaps it gets better but 6 episodes was enough for me before becoming board with it. ","6"
"Lucifer",2016-10-13," Well. This is my first review, for many time here and never done one, is because, this is the first time I got something worth to review. Even if English is not my mother language, I will try my best... sorry if something is misspelled or wrong written. I like complex things. And this character (religion out) is far more complex than any. I read the comics  The Sandman  and  Lucifer , and the premise is cool, considering the series is attached some how with the new issues coming from the comic. I liked the acting, specially Ellis... the girl is fine, and I like the chemistry between them. And more of it,the FX, for a TV series are cool. The script was fine, and got me (but... I knew who did it, to much TV for me, I confess. Though I will not spoil it) In the other hand, I know some people say it was overrated, but: There is a flavor for every taste... And for my taste it was awesome, delicious and brilliant. Every one is a critic, and every one can criticize, but it worth to take a look, just to know if you like it or not. And for the ones on seeing the religious way... People, there are others channels and other series to watch. That is it. Greetings from Uruguay. ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-10-03," The show is quite watchable. However with every episode I watch the same thought comes to mind.  What a waste . The show is based on a comic book, which has a very dark tone. And it's that dark tone that gives the appeal. There are so many dark avenues that can be explored further. Delving into angelic and demonic backgrounds. More about their hellish backgrounds and allow the characters to be truer to their nature. That are all from hell!!it's so much fun to see Lucifer get that evil look in his eye. And such a waste when they turn that evil look into some attempt at humor.It's on network TV so I can understand some limitations. But at the same time it just leaves me feeling a tad unsatisfied. I just feel they can do so much more with the script. ","5"
"Lucifer",2016-09-27," Excellent TV Show that teaches us  How NOT to be JUST black and white  . There are always gray parts that we do not wanna see in life. We tend to blame others for our own mistakes. It's not about religion. It is about the choices we make everyday, it is about the responsibility we take/don't take for our actions. Tom Ellis is an incredible actor! I think playing Lucifer so well in this show made me re-think the general concept of all this characters who play a role in our lives. All the cast is great! Thanks to the whole crew for creating this show! :) LOVE IT!!! ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-09-25," This show is wicked good, it makes me laugh and just allows me to relax and have fun. I love the premise that the Devil went on vacation and that he feels tormented by what he has had to endure. I also like that he likes to help people, and that he stays around the cop even though she makes him vulnerable  mortal  at times.It's an interesting premise & I hope that it gets renewed passed season two so that I can continue to enjoy it.I like that they have now thrown his Mother into the mix and that they're both upset with  Dear old Dad  or God.It humanizes the characters and makes them relate-able.People need not take this so seriously, its just a feel good show and I really like the thought process of the characters especially how straightforward Lucifer is about being the Devil.People often just think he is kidding, until often to late they realize that he was telling the truth.Life is anecdotal like that, if you believe something. Perhaps you should live it... ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-09-21," I think this is show is wonderful.I just hate that after waiting for the season premiere to come and then watching the episode. The  mum  everyone has been talking about did not show up until the final seconds.And then I hear  Coming up in 2 Weeks .W T F!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! What is happening with Hollywood. They are not making enough episodes to fill a whole season. What can possibly come on in the place of this show, that could be so important. NOTHING.I just don't understand the reason behind waiting to continue to  mum  story-line. I can understand the anticipation of it...... but this is the first and second episode of a new season.What's is going on. ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-09-19," No one can take this show too seriously. If you do you're missing the point of it. It's entertaining. It's fun to watch. The title character gives the viewer enough personality to keep you interested, while the plots and other characters are all there for him to play off of.I was glad they didn't change much of the format for the season two opener. Too often shows forget what made them successful in the first place and try to expand on that...which usually ends up getting chaotic. Lucifer seems to be maintaining it's appeal.The only thing I don't like is that Lucifer is kinda wimpy. For a spiritual being, which should be strength the likes of which we can't even imagine, he gets beat up a lot.All-in-all, it's just a fun show to watch. The addition of Lucifer's  mum  at the end might be an interesting new twist. We'll have to wait and see. ","8"
"Lucifer",2016-09-14," For me this TV show is perfect.It's new and fresh.And show us other side of the devil.The first season was really good.I hope that season 2 will be as good as 1 or better. I was fan of supernatural but there is non end show and I am really board of it.Here we see a lot of action which is mixed with a lot of styles - Drama,horror,comedy,crime ... and more which are so good mixed that holds you from the beginning to the end of the every episode.And let me say some words for Tom Ellis or Lucifer ...yeah this actor really love his role.His presence and acting are in new level.From what I read in internet I am agree that he has to be the new agent 007.And let say some words for the soundtrack.Wow speechless every song is perfect for each moment.I don't know how they did it but I like it a lot.And for final give a chance to this show and you will be surprised of it how much interesting it is.

"Lucifer",2016-09-10," When I read the concept of Lucifer I thought Hell!!! this would be awesome. I was eagerly awaiting the release. When I saw the first episode I thought  not what I had imagined but hey its still worth a watch . But from the 2nd episode it starting getting disappointing with a little bit evil action here or there. I mean Satan fighting criminals, helping people with their miseries, COME ON he could do a lot better. Whatever happened to good old selling our soul to the devil and fulfilling our deepest desires. Now that's something the LUCIFER is good at and he should stick to that. Plus i never really liked Lauren German's acting except in maybe Hostel 2. She is pretty but honestly her portrayal of a cop didn't help the show either. In short the experience was Disappointing. ","2"
"Lucifer",2016-09-06," Usual cheap daytime TV soap formulae of the following: 1. Actors chosen for eye candy appeal with little else to enhance the storyline. Evidence: Cheap hourly rates; resumes loaded with never- heard-of gigs of  TV-series . 2. One black in a minor but positive role. He does get to spout some really bad CGI wings every so often. One female usually in a counter starring role and for crime/detective plots she often is the detective. Female det., as if typical, has the weight, strength and athletic agility to be the best - wait, yes, a yoga instructor. What's really poorly thought out is through all her Ep. 1, 2 dangerous detective work her long hair is model loose. Ever hear of tying it back so it doesn't interfere with basic policing? Well, the director caught that minor discrepancy in some later episodes. 3. Since this series has a Satanic vibe, during episode one I was waiting for the cheap and humorously overused red eyes effect (i.e.cheap evil); disappointed, but not for long because guess what shows up in episode 2? Yep, red eyes. Then there is the other cheap Satanic effect floating whatever - people, objects. Again, not to be outdone they added a floating coin and apple - both effects pointless, besides really cheaply done. 4. 90+% of this series is low budget close up filming with cheap props, sets, costumes, just a few actors with lots of talking and no words too difficult for high school beyond 10th grade. OK, Ellis (Luc) does give us some fun dialogue, but that's about all that's worth the hours of one's life. 5. It's just boring, uncreative, ripoff writing. ","2"
"Lucifer",2016-09-05," I always try to give a show a chance by watching the first few episodes which in this case is roughly half the season. I really wanted to like it as its an interesting premise but I feel like they wasted that. This is really just a cop show with a twist the twist being that he is the devil. The problem is is that other than him mentioning that he's the devil every 5 mins the show doesn't do much with it. Apart from the occasional lame power for people to tell him what they desire ( odd power for the devil to have) or the flicker of his true self which again does not impart much fear.Oh yes and there is the annoying  brother  that pops in pretty much every episode to tell him to come back, which of course he ignores so those scenes become redundant and useless. There are too many thing that aren't explained well and too many things that happen over and over again that the show just becomes boring, monataneous and predictable. You can check it out of it you want but I gty you will be disappointed. ","5"
"Lucifer",2016-09-02," When I've first saw the trailer for Lucifer I thought how will it be cool. To be honest, each episode made me feel more empathy for the devil. Sure, there are some misunderstandings, but I totally dig the whole movie. From the very start, you can meet the devil, walk by his side and see the world through his eyes. Even the other characters, even though I hope they will develop much more in the second season. For now, I may say, this is one of the most interesting TV shows. You will love the idea of ''modern devil''. Beside that, some of the characters are pretty nasty - and it's not Lucifer's fault. It will totally change your view on Lucifer. ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-09-01," The main reason for me wanting to this was for Tom Ellis; he was brilliant in Miranda plus the whole heaven and hell theme so I was instantly on board for this.There is a big part of this show <U+0096> most of the season actually <U+0096> that is just another cop show but this guy happens to have some 'powers' but even those aren't used on every case. There are some boring story lines through the show especially in the middle and it's not until the last two episodes that things start to pick up.There is some bad green screen work with basic driving scenes but also a rooftop scene with some horrible work. There were some awesome bits and pieces in some of the episodes including one where the therapist, Dr. Linda Martin, goes out onto the field.There are a lot of funny bits through the whole season, mostly Lucifer but sometimes the other cast members are the ones providing the laughs.Something that annoyed me was the dropping, or ignoring, of story lines. Something happens at the beginning of the season between Lucifer and Chloe, the detective, which just simmers out and is only touched upon every couple of episodes.The cast is pretty good, most of them get some character development as the season progresses but I'm not too sure about Chloe (Lauren German). I think the actress is good but I just don't think the character is being written very well; some moments she seems really smart and tough (mostly the first and last episodes) but then in other moments (the rest of the season) she gets kind of airy and it's almost like the writers are deliberately dumbing her down.It's a show that has its ups and downs, it's not a show where I ever need to watch Season One again but I will probably watch the second season.

"Lucifer",2016-08-25," There are people who believe Lucifer and Satan are not the same. Why are you complaining now when DC Lucifer was created somewhere in the 90s. If the bible should not be taken literally why would the audience of this show think it is true that Lucifer is good. The show does not preach to worship Satan and who on earth would take the show seriously. This show is based on a DC character not Lucifer from the bible which says that Lucifer and Satan are the same besides there are people who does not read the bible. The title of the show caught my attention and when watched the pilot episode it was great. Tom Ellis's acting fits. I did not know that DC Comics had a character Lucifer. There were some part I did not like but Lucifer and Chloe, Tom Ellis's acting, some funny moments made it all worth watching. ","8"
"Lucifer",2016-08-23," This is a surprisingly addictive show called Lucifer. I originally wasn't going to give it a chance but I really, really like it.It airs on Fox here in the US on Monday nights at nine PM and it's loosely based on the version of Lucifer created by Niel Gaiman for the Sandman comics for DC. It's already been renewed for a second season so once you catch up (if you want to watch it) a new batch of episodes will be on it's way.The premise is this. Lucifer (Yes, the Devil) quits. He up and quits. Think Jack Skellington bored with Halloween. He quits Hell and goes to Earth to open a Night club and the longer he stays on Earth the more human-like he becomes. He's slowly learning things like love, mercy, honor, and a longing to protect the innocent. It's a story about The Devil on a redemption arc if you can believe that. It's a very, very unique twist on The Devil.An Angel named Amenadiel tries to make Lucifer go back to Hell because Hell needs a ruler and he knows if Lucifer doesn't go back then God might appoint someone else to be The Devil (as apparently this can happen). But the longer Amenadiel stays on Earth the darker he is becoming. As Lucifer rises, Amenadiel is falling. He's doing some twisted and evil things to try to make Lucifer go back so it's likely he'll end up the next devil.There's a female homicide detective named Chloe. She and Lucifer are friends. She doesn't actually believe he's The Devil. She thinks he's just crazy but oddly useful in solving murder cases. And he's oddly drawn to her so Lucifer becomes a police consultant to hang around her and he slowly comes to realize he is PHYSICALLY mortal around her. He could die if she harms him. Also he gets a literal drug-like high whenever she acknowledges he's done something good. And that's just really adorable. ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-08-11," I stopped reading comics when I was about 13 (which is quite a while ago), and I have never heard of the one that bred this character. Also, I normally hate this genre as well as any others re super-heroes, vampires and the devil etc: I find them downright silly. However, I've stuck through the first two episodes and have surprised myself.After almost giving up after the first ten minutes I battled on regardless and found Lucifer to be pretty good entertainment. Mind you, if it wasn't for Tom Ellis I think it would sink. Like a lot of American TV now it is well made and acted, and with high production values - where do they get the money from?Even though I'm British I can't recollect seeing Ellis in anything else. But he's good with lots of charisma, and perfect for this part. ","8"
"Lucifer",2016-08-08," Very different from what I thought it would be. Has humor and an alluring cast. I have just started watching but I can already tell this is going to be a show that I will take the time to watch each week. I like crime procedurals and I like it when they have some sort of twist to them. Lucifer working with a female detective is definitely a neat twist. It's too soon to tell where this will go but I like the chemistry between them. The premise may be a turn off for some people so I am a bit worried it might get canceled. Don't want to get invested in something that may only be around for one season. I like shows that have long runs. It can take time to explore the dynamics of the characters but they are off to a good start. ","7"
"Lucifer",2016-08-03," The first season of Lucifer took me by surprise. Considering that the reviews here are very mixed I was not really sure whether I should watch it or not, so I decided to watch the pilot and get an opinion of my own.The first season is pretty much  crime of the week . There is nothing wrong with that. But considering that there already are many shows that revolves around that, and considering the source material, I wish for more development of the plot in season 2. And since mother dearest now has escaped from hell I might just get my wish. The characters that the show circles around are also good. Especially Lucifer himself. He is funny, witty (and also a good musician). He also have both a darker more sinister side that I hope we see more of in the future. Tom Ellis really does a good job here.I like the whole  sympathy for the devil  thing Lucifer has. It really works here. This series has all the potential to be a really great TV-show. ","8"
"Lucifer",2016-07-21," discovering this show, by word of mouth, was such a joy! a send up of the stuff i had crammed down my throat for way too many years is delightful.Ellis is very tall and very slender, so he looms without being physically menacing. It doesn't hurt that he is very very nice to look at.German is the perfect straight man: sternly serious and still appealing.I do think Trixie steals the show.has anyone mentioned the reference to the silver city, and  You were supposed to be blonde.    I get that a lot.  ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-07-20," You could tell so many awesome storys about the Devil, but they decided to make him a shitty consulting detective with no power whatsoever.The plot is full of holes, every character could be a fashion model, and characters appear in places that make absolutely no sense.The cop girl for example walks into a drug bosses lair with like 50 armed black drug dealers COMPLETELY ALONE and wants to arrest him.That's about how much thought goes into every scene and conversation in this series. You can clearly see, that characters act and appear where the writers want them to, rather then what would make sense for the character.2/10 because it's kinda funny sometimes. ","2"
"Lucifer",2016-07-17," I literally can't stop binge watching this series <3 I don't really know what else to say about Lucifer... I love his humor and I like seeing all the Hawaii Five O stars starring in this season. Lori West, Governor Danning Detective, Vincent Fryer and I've seen Josette Parker from the Vampire Diaries and oh Kayla Ewell as well :D I love seeing familiar faces and the show is just awesome... I can't wait for season 2. Definitely gonna keep watching this! How many more lines do I need here? 10 lines seriously? But anyway... ah... since I can't really spoiler anybody here nor do I want to... But I guess it's save to say that I like the kind of  relationship  Chloe and Lucifer have and I like that he can't get shot in the beginning. Makes for some really cool scenes. ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-06-25," What an uninspiring show. A show that can't seem to choose between either a supernatural show or a cop show, and it does bad job at both of them. The supernatural part is lame, tame, and hardly there. The protagonist keeps emphasising his role as Lucifer and his powers, and those mentions are probably the most exciting cases of supernatural elements you get throughout the whole season, since nothing much happens supernatural-wise. There's hardly any character development, except for *SPOILER* the very lame and predictable detective love interest. YAWN! There is no mention of the lore or Lucifer's role as a fallen angel. He's just simply there to be obtuse and annoying. For me, the character had NO likability or charm, and the fact they stereotypically chose a standard British accent (although Tom is Welsh with no traces of Welsh accent, since that's probably too foreign for Americans) only adds to the annoyance. Those interested in cop shows should skip this show as well. It's unprofessional and the case-solving is shallow and ridiculous. Loftyonthehill described the show as  tired, wooden and nonsensical cop show. Nothing more, nothing less , which is about right. I would add uninspiring as well. If you have nothing better to do, watch it, if you're dying to see a good show, pleaaasseee skip this junk. Maybe your teenage daughter will like this. ","5"
"Lucifer",2016-06-15," Finally, something on Fox worth watching! The concept is outstanding and the complexity of the characters, coupled with the chemistry of the cast, are just a few of the things that make me look forward to watching the next season. There is nothing more satisfying than cheering for the bad guy desperately trying to be good, and Tom Ellis pulls this off brilliantly! Laura German, D.B. Wood, Lesley-Ann Brandt and Racheal Harris are perfectly cast and excellent in their performances. The choice of Tom Ellis to portray Lucifer was sheer perfection as his talents are key to this particular role. The way that he delivers his lines, tongue in cheek, is paramount in the success of this series. Kudos to the writers, the producers and cast for a job well done! The dynamics of this show just work! ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-06-05," A series that has the advantage of being original! And it is a very good point. And I can tell you it is for me one of the best series that I've looked! Each episode is purely good shot and very well thought out. And actors! They embody their characters to perfection! Especially Tom Ellis with a game that is stunning, her accent, her head etc etc fits exactly with the characters of Lucifer! Lucifer and Chloe are both very different and very endearing. The spontaneity of Lucifer makes the series even better, it is shocking and hilarious. Finally a great series as it is rare to see! I strongly advise. (I'm sorry for my bad English, ++I'm form belgian) ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-05-31," If you're a fan of detective shows and flirt a bit with fiction then this is the show for you. It's a fun light-hearted drama series based on the fallen Angel himself Lucifer played by British actor Tom Ellis. He decides to take a break from hell and stay in Las Angeles where he buys a club and lives a life of sin. He soon meets a detective by the name of Chloe Decker played by Lauren German. It takes a while to get used to her, as her acting skills aren't exactly polished. Though you tend to give her the benefit of the doubt due to her stunning eyes, but she does grow into her role. The two start working together on cases in an unconventional way at first, with Lucifer liking the thrill of hunting bad guys and the fact the Chloe bats away his advances, which no other woman can resist, including Psychiatrist Linda Martin played by Rachel Harris. Chloe and Lucifer interrogate her and then she becomes a series regular whereby she listens and tries to help Lucifer and his so called 'delusions' of being the Devil and in return he ahem... The series develops with a not-so-fallen Angel trying to return Lucifer back to guard the gates of hell, which he had abandoned. However Lucifer is in no desire to leave the freedom of earth, he's enjoying himself way too much. Tom Ellis' performance really brings out the best of this character and is a joy to watch his arrogant, self-centered character go from just that to develop certain human-like traits as the show progresses. You tend to sympathise with him, which is weird because he is the Devil and the Devil is probably the last person you'd ever think to identify yourself with. A good all round show with an interesting cliffhanger that will keep you waiting for Season 2. ","7"
"Lucifer",2016-05-30," For anyone to go into this without any preconceived notions will find this to be ridiculously entertaining. If your looking for the lulz you won't find them as some of them are subtle and to focus entirely on that can make the true intent of the screenplay and the thrill of story telling pointless. The whole point of Lucifer's character is shrouded in a mysterious persona and from that angle add in a volatile tongue and quick witted remarks and intellectual humor makes this mind boggling series amusing.Pretend the character is like a stone in an ocean. And Lucifer's whole perception of his take on his interests is him fancifully skipping rocks so it always hits the stone in the seemingless endless ocean. He knows his stuff and isn't afraid to protrude into the minds of people as this gives him benefit of the doubt whenever he finds himself in situations that require little to no thinking.Lucifer just knows and thats the antenna to the satellite that people don't connect. The trick is to watch this series while you experience life and how it really does tell a realm of possibility that exists and has been taken out of from. I mean Lucifer? The heavenly beautiful angel that takes a vacation to the human world? And he has made  friends  with a female? Who knows what strange things lay await in this series.I don't really write reviews as this is my first review and I hope saying little makes sense instead of revealing a lot of what I believe to be the legitimacy of a movie. ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-05-22," I've tried to keep it spoiler free, but I'm sorry if there still are any. Lucifer  is an adaptation of the character Lucifer, also known as the angel of death (not sure though). But he has abandoned hell, and he has entered our world, where he meets Chloe, a police officer. With her he starts to solve mysteries, and that's the main premise of the series.The directing of the series is very good, and consistent. The consistent part is very important, otherwise you would have a incoherent show, which isn't good, as you could've guessed. Of course this isn't the only thing that makes the show great, or that makes directors great. The directors didn't choose any shaky cam, and used all steady cam. I very much like this style. The fight scene in the finale was surprisingly good. I was genually surprised by this, because the shows fight scenes were most of the time small scale, but this time it was bigger... And better. The fight choreography was also fantastic. Way better than  Arrow , a show that's known for its fighting scenes. The cinematography was also just perfect. It felt like I was watching a movie, well, a short one. It's of course no  Fargo  or  Mr. Robot  (just to name a few recent shows) but it's good. The sound was also good, and not notably bad. But the soundtrack, boy the soundtrack. This was the absolute star of the show. I absolutely loved the idea of using music in the theme of god/heaven/hell/devil etc. This just made the show more fun. The editing was also good. I didn't really looked after mistakes, so there are of course things that are wrong, but nothing of putting. The make-up, as for they used some, was also pretty good.The acting now. Well, this is a yes and no. The main actor is Tom Ellis. He absolutely nails the part. He is fantastic and believable as the character of the devil. Buuuuuut at times his acting capability just seemed to disappear and line deliveries were bad. For the most part though he was fantastic, but at moments I was thinking: What just happened? How come he delivered that line thát bad? He was intimidating when he needed too, and he didn't make me laugh at those times. It could've been possible if he was a complete bad actor. The person he teams up with is Chloe, she is played by Lauren German. Her acting was also pretty good. Nothing that really impressed me, though. She also has a daughter in the show, who actually plays a relatively big role. This role is played by Scarlett Estevez. Scarlett was fine. She really had her bad moments, but she still is very young, so I guess she'll evolve into a better actress. The supporting cast was also very good, I'll just skim over them really quick: Maz was good, Dan too, D.B. Woodside who played Amenadiel was very good.The script was also fantastic. The dialogue was absolutely great. This, and the music, were the things that got me hooked immediately. The script writers managed to create a very well fleshed out character, and every line made it feel like this was something that the character would say. I'm obviously talking about the character of Lucifer Morningstar. He was funny, sarcastic, and amazing overall. He was very likable too. The character had a dark past, and has to deal with his things, and they put this down amazingly. Buuuuuuut (again) he is the only one that was really fleshed out. I understand that they did this, but I think that they should've given Chloe too a good character. They tried to do this, by the marriage side plot, with Dan, but this didn't work out. And that were a lot of 'buts'. Chloe was also annoying at times, because she couldn't seem to understand that Lucifer really was the devil. This was annoying, and stupid, because she is supposed to be a smart character. A thing a quickly want to mention is that I very much enjoyed the perspective that they took with this series. Telling it from the eyes of the devil himself. I know that this is an adaptation, but still. The 'crime of the week' thing they did, did work out for me. I would've loved that they payed more attention to the main story of the series. The first episode was very good, one of the best pilots I've seen. I say one of, because the pilot of  Mr.Robot  is the best one I've ever seen. The middle episodes had it's good and bad moments, but the last two episodes were very good again. The villain, though, wasn't the greatest. It wasn't someone intimidating enough, sadly.I also liked the tone of the show. It had a dark atmosphere, but it also had its funny moments, let me tell you, it is a funny show. And I want to mention this because that it's very impressive how they managed to switch quickly between those two tones.Overall this was a fun and entertaining show. I'm glad that it got renewed, and I'm looking forward to the next season!9.5/10 ","9"
"Lucifer",2016-05-20," Finally a show that shows the devil  Lucifer  as not just some evil in the night waiting to prey on the innocent. But as someone who is here for a reason, to punish those who commit evil acts against other humans. Seeing how Lucifer interacts with and starts to relate to humanity is wonderful. The female lead is brilliantly done. Tough, smart and loving as a single mother as well as a teacher to Lucifer. I love how the people from hell are all effected by Trixie and a child's innocence. I think it will be something to see when Lucifer's brother Amenadiel has his interaction with the child. Patiently awaiting the next episode with their mother escaping from Hell. Does anyone have any idea on when it will air? ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-05-19," Its been a long while since i have come across a unique and well scripted TV series. It has the all the ingredients that make up a good show. Good acting, action, comedy, plot and something that people can relate to in one way or the other. Each episode leaves you with something to thing about and makes you laugh at the same time. Its an interpretation often miss understood because there actually isn't anything to explain or understand, its just a big what if the devil actually did wear  Prada . Its like NCIS without the politics and a darker shade of Super Natural. And now I cant really imagine anyone else playing Lucifer but Tom. ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-05-14," I wrote a review about the first episode and will do the same about the last. In summary, I think the show missed the chance to do something different, but at least it kept the audience entertained. I skipped a few episodes in the middle because of internet band width and international travel issues so maybe i missed some classic TV but I think not. Tom Ellis's acting seems sound but i think they made a casting mistake. He is too pretty, and when he gets together with his brother the show starts to look decidedly camp. I would have gone for a more punk look for at least one of the two. In spite of the above I still gave the final episode a 7. I enjoyed it warts and all. ","7"
"Lucifer",2016-04-24," This is one of the few shows I follow at the moment, but I am not sure as to why. The show is cheesy, sometimes badly acted (by side- or second rate characters)and the story feels more like if an alcoholic magician meets a detective and then they go out on a Castle-esque adventures. Never for a second I feel like this is actually about the Devil, and being an atheist I sort of dismiss the entire premise. Still, this is pretty good. I have watched every episode twice over so far and I cannot help liking the show. The two leads have great chemistry, some of the story lines are very good and decently fresh and at times I forget the objections I have above. If they bring in a little more other-worldly stuff and perhaps a better main antagonist this might become ever better. Well worth your time if you have nothing else to do. ","7"
"Lucifer",2016-04-24," The chemistry between the characters is amazing. I enjoy the interactions between Lucifer and the detective, but most of all I love watching the relationships between the angel Amenadiel, the demon Mazikeen and Lucifer himself - you really get the sense that they go back a long way, and their powerful, sexy, and violent interactions are always great fun to watch.There are also some excellent performances by many of the actors playing smaller roles, such as Kevin Alejandro as another detective, and Kevin Rankin as yet another detective (without dropping any spoilers, these characters have a very cool story line in the later episodes of Season 1). Another great performance is by Scarlett Estevez - it can be hard to watch child actors as they often visibly struggle with the concept of acting, though this one absolutely nails her role as the lead detective's daughter.Some people complain about the procedural aspect of the show - a new crime each episode for the two leads to solve, though more often than not the crimes give Lucifer a platform for some interesting character development as he tries to find his way and his role in an unfamiliar human world. It should also be noted that unlike most other procedural cop shows, there is a very strong, fast-paced, and engaging focus on the over-arching story of the show, which in this case is a story of Lucifer as he rebels against those who would see him back in Hell and fights to have a say in he way he lives his life.My only complaint would be that some of the writing for Lucifer's character can be cringe-worthy, in that while he can be very good with people and is usually the life of a party, he can also be very socially inept and incapable of seeing just how out-of-place some of the things he does are. Nonetheless, this can often make for some funny situations.Overall, a great show with some really cool (and sexy) characters. Good fun to watch. ","9"
"Lucifer",2016-04-23," Let me get one thing straight - I have never read the comic, so I have no idea what the original story/character is like. Even so, I was expecting a heck of a lot more than this. This might just be the lamest, least original, most annoying take on the infamous fallen angel I've seen so far, and I've seen a LOT of them. It bothers me how they're trying so damned hard to make him look like this really cool and savvy guy, and yet he just comes across as obnoxious, patronizing and arrogant - and definitely not in a good way. I'd be okay with it if he was at least a LITTLE bit evil, but he's not. He's fighting crime. He punishes bad guys. He CARES about people. No, seriously - WTF? I think a lot of people would agree with me on this: If you watch a show titled  Lucifer , you're kind of HOPING for the evil anti-hero. Not this laughable excuse for a devil. Also, I've only seen the pilot episode so far, but the sheer amount of blatant misogyny in this one episode made me gag. The female detective tries so hard to be tough and stay on top of things, but with the way that this is written, she usually ends up looking like a naive fool next to the oh-so charming and witty prince of darkness. It's actually a bit sickening to watch. (And Christ, let's not even mention the singer who got shot. I'm absolutely disgusted by the way she was written.) The soundtracks are decent, I guess, but sadly not very original. Definitely the typical  rebel  soundtracks commonly used for this particular kind of show with this particular kind of title character. (How many times has  Howlin' for you  been used as a soundtrack by now? Good lord.) Overall, I'm just really disappointed. I was expecting so much more. ","2"
"Lucifer",2016-04-20," The truth is, no show is without its faltering points. It is a bit on the tame side. It overly tries to downplay Lucifer's dark side, never actually allowing him to punish anyone but does an amazing job getting the viewer to feel and understand his plight. He is the torturer, the punisher, and justice bringer. He is not the monster humanity makes him out to be. Similar to Hades in Greek mythology. He's just a guy who's given a crap job and all that is bad is blamed on him. The acting is spot on for most characters. I wish they would let him loose for an episode or two and I think for the finale, they might. Overall a great show. Do not go the Constantine route with heavy foreshadowing of some dark force brewing. Supernatural has beaten that horse to death. ","8"
"Lucifer",2016-04-19," Similar with many reviewers out here I was intrigued by the pilot episode, but the interest shortly waned afterwards with the many non-original detective episodes. Luckily I did not stop watching. The story line and character development moves quite fast after a lull of a few episodes mid-season, and by the pen-ultimate episode of season 1 the show is back in its glory.The repetitive detective format is luckily the backdrop of a storyline, rather than the opposite. As the season progresses all sort of interesting dynamics happen between the main characters, whilst at the same time also introducing new characters with central roles. I am really looking forwards to the next episode.PS: For those of you that thinks Lucifer is too 'human' - Lucifer makes a point in the penultimate episode of the season that he punishes evil, and asks thus why would he want evil to happen? ","9"
"Lucifer",2016-04-19," I am a big fan of Neil Gaiman, and I read the Lucifer books beautifully created by Mike Carey, so I was excited and afraid when I learned that a TV series was being created, I started imagining Lucifer with blond hair and beautiful like in the books, I got little disappointed when I saw that they cast Tom Ellis as Lucifer, but my doubts were over when I saw his performance, he nailed Lucifer, he is great and I love his interactions with humans, I understood the series creators to deviate a little from the books but the stories are working fine, I am really glad that Fox decided to renew for season two, Lucifer deserves to be watched by the people who read the books and enjoyed the beautiful stories of redemption and lost souls along with the graphics, and now we can watch Tom Ellis to bring it to life, great job everyone and I hope I can watch this series for many years. Brilliant. ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-04-16," This series got me hooked on the pilot episode. And the series that have done that before, I don't even need all the fingers of my hands to count them.Tom Ellis is simply brilliant playing Lucifer. He's smart but at the same time so ignorant to the ways of humans. He cares while at the same time sometimes complicating things more than they needed to be. The way Tom handles his character is simply remarkable. And there's real chemistry or at least we feel it as real, between Ellis and Lauren characters. He's the kind of Devil that we can relate to. We understand why he is how he is. We sort of understand where his struggle with God comes from. Making him definitely the center stone of this TV series.Lauren German, Chloe, also wields her own mystery. The way Lucifer lands in her life and how their relationship develops feels real. She doesn't simply accepts the fact that Lucifer has his uses. No. The way they come to accept they need each other, is a progressive process. It all happens for a reason. And Chloe although initially we can feel her total dislike for Lucifer, Lauren makes Chloe change of mind look and feel real.This show has a lot potential. Not only for the two main characters relationship and where it can go, but individually as well, each have a lot of baggage in their past to allow the viewers to know there's still a lot we don't know about them. And that holds and grabs me to the show. All the hypothesis, all the paths this series can take... This can become the next really big success if the producers keep up with this winning formula.If you haven't seen this TV series, then you're losing out on some of the best entertainment I've seen in years. ","9"
"Lucifer",2016-04-12," This is a clever show, although they do rely a bit too heavily on Tom Ellis' charms to carry the hour. He's tap dancing as fast as he can to keep the action lively, but at the end of the hour I feel tired FOR him. The stories are engaging, but the rest of the cast is just not up to his level. Kevin Alejandro is poorly cast as the ex-husband. He is ordinary, and it is difficult to imagine our bold, confident heroine going for him in the first place or choosing him over Lucifer at the end of the day. For a triangle to work, both candidates need to be equally compelling.My primary complaint is that the show is tinted a sickly green. Is this a creative choice? To make the female lead look like she's finishing up her third round of chemo? Whatever the thinking, it is wrong. It is distracting. Try some healthier tones please.If they can adjust the tint and raise the level of acting around Tom Ellis, I think the show will make it to a second season. ","7"
"Lucifer",2016-04-11," Complete fantasy. Absolutely love this series. I look forward to every Monday just to watch. I can perfectly see the temptation in this devil, and the beguiling character. Hitched up with humor the combination of the dark side mixed with the light side is an intriguing concept. The writers are great with the one-liners and Chloe is the perfect straight man. They make a great team. I'm really looking forward to more episodes. Captivated with the concept of angels and devils walking amongst us for devious purposes. So many directions to take this story line. Its simply great entertainment. Tom Ellis is the perfect actor to portray the devil. He makes the show. ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-04-05," Yes! We do need this ! To really show that even devil will slowly. become a enlightened. He will possibly change to the true angel close to god. There is lots of ideas and future possibilities. I love watching every part of it. Most of people's personalities and their true desires can be found here. So possibly a simple love or caring and willing to help, be always there on earth It will help Lucifer possibly to transform. Bet you he can get his wings back. Thank you guys.The devil doesn't judge you for being human.Why would he?He can be in any world (hell ,earth ,higher worlds ) Remember Devil represent all desires (darkest and lightest) that show it to us if you willing to see that. ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-04-05," Everyone hating on Lucifer not being satanic or evil enough are missing the point. The devil character in this show has been completely reinvented. He's the naughty rebellious son who has a bad reputation. In the context of this show, people's beliefs about  the devil  are false and superstitious. Lucifer is clearly annoyed by all the false assumptions. I love the clever writing. Lucifer admits openly his true identity, and everyone just thinks he's talking in metaphors or exaggerating. When he speaks of daddy issues people assume he's talking about a human dad so they blow off the fact that he just called his dad  God.  All his self-centered inappropriate social behavior reminds me of Steve Carrell's character on the office. Good comedy. It's hilarious. ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-04-05," The series started well, l really like the acting of Tom Ellis in first two or three episodes but than he started the lost the gem of the character in some points or maybe l was expecting too much from him...Some of his postures was seemed like a little bit amateurish or lets say raw in some certain moments as an actor. l guess the script writing crew is also lacking of inspiration lately because l can easily say the episodes really started to seem so much to each one. Same attitudes from characters to each other, or to the events occurred in the episodes, similar circumstances or crimes or side characters, same affairs, same problem analysis, similar God father complaints from Lucifer in certain moments and etc...l hope they don't mess the series. We are talking about the bloody devil himself and he has to be funnier, tougher, braver, god mocker, etc etc..You get the idea. Latelty l watched the episode 10 and now l can guess where may the whole series will go. So if l won't see anything surprising in the next episodes or at he end of this season, l guess l will unfortunately stop watching it. ","7"
"Lucifer",2016-04-04," please keep this on. great lead actor I remember he was a doctor last year. he is very good in both very dry humor entertaining why would parents object to this show? Lucifer is kind and learning to be a good angel!!!very good morality lessons here keep up the great fun, I will be looking forward to many seasons of this series.so many of the good shows are gone before people really get into then. PLEASE do not let this happen to LUCIFER!!when will executives learn what watchers really love in a t.v. show? the writing is also lots of fun I love the plot line I can see this going on for as long as Supernatural which is in its 12 season and no one even knows about that show but a handful of hardcore fans please guys do not let us down by getting us all caught up in this fun show then letting it disappear!!!!!!!!!!!!

"Lucifer",2016-04-04," Pros. 1. Weekly crime solving detective story - if its your thing. 2. The British accent and the everyday personalities of the characters. 3. No attempt at giving any religious undertones (I'm 5 episodes through) 4. The Devil is not trying to hide his identity, so a lot of difficult explanations are out of the way. The issue with immortality becomes a lighthearted moot point, unlike Forever and similar story lines. 5. Has a charm, no application of brains required - just enjoy the show. Cons. 1. The rules of the game keep changing. The basic premise of the story is not true to its own made-up set of rules at times. 2. Personality of Lucifer and other frequent characters does not build up linearly. 3. Not the greatest production values. Result. You've seen a dozen similar shows before, but if a detective crime solving storyline is your thing, then it is really worth a watch. Gives a nice twist to the oft repeated tales. ","8"
"Lucifer",2016-04-03," Yes, I read the comic. I understand how this show is different from the comic. It was supposed to be. Lucifer has been on Earth in Los Angeles for 5 years. This is THAT Lucifer. Not the Lucifer that jumped portals and dimensions to feed his need for rebellion. Now with that over...I find Lucifer's current character compelling. It is very interesting to see how he is handling his coping with not only being cast out of heaven, but also his time on Earth. Obviously, there will be some issues with how this is mapped out; however, overall his character is well written in my opinion. I find all the characters to actually be well written. They did their homework on psychologists for two characters. The plot has a few holes here and there, but overall I'm extremely happy with how this show is progressing. I believe that once this first season is over that the second season will be even better, if we get a second season. I definitely hope this gets a second season. I support this show whole heartedly against any who wanted to ban it for  humanizing Satan.  Lol. ","9"
"Lucifer",2016-04-01," After a couple of episodes, the plot did seem to be like a simple crime solving series which they actually do in each episode but that is not the point.Lucifer's change and his emotional troubles of being the devil seems to be answered by his father through the one thing that builds up excitement inside him which is his thirst for justice.The answers Lucifer seeks are all being answered one by one through the cases he encounters and I think eventually Lucifer will have a change of perspective once he notices this. After 9th and 10th episode it gets clear where the show's finale is heading.Overall its a good show which had a few episodes in the middle that felt like they led nowhere but later on humanity is getting the better out of Lucifer. ","9"
"Lucifer",2016-03-30," A quite interesting show full of dark humour and a singular thread of redemption running through it. Personally I can't understand all the angst against this show I can only assume that a certain segment of society just don't like having their ingrained beliefs shaken. Basically this will end up as a tale of redemption for anyone who is willing to change regardless of their past, which to be honest is a good rule to live by.The show itself is predictable as it can only be given the storyline but it's actually written in a snappy, obviously non too serious way and is no difference from lets says  Castle  where in reality the only difference is  who  the main protagonists are.Actually really enjoy the show and it's sub-current of redemption for all regardless of your past. People need to lighten up and enjoy life for what it is not what you've been told it is. ","9"
"Lucifer",2016-03-29," I just don't get one thing. People who say this show glorify Satan. What portraying Satan as a good guy get on your nerves. I mean the show doesn't have any rituals as supernatural, but still that show is on season 11 and it rocks. Sure there are some episodes that didn't reach our expectations but didn't affect the show. And why all these petitions to stop airing lucifer, some because the devil is portrayed as a good guy, and some because it's different that the comics??? I read the comics and it's cool to have a Hollywood twist. Don't like stick to the comics and whatever show you watch. The cast have great chemistry and especially Tom Ellis and Lauren German. All and all watch the show. It's hilarious and doesn't insult anything. Stop being oversensitive about TV shows they're made so we have a good time and laugh after a long day. Hope this show is renewed. ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-03-28," Truth be told this show is a refreshing view on the dark thrills of shows with Lucifer out there and it represent Lucifer for what he is really describe, not a lord of darkness but a child who resent his father because he was grounded for talking back to his father, so in more understandable term's a child trowing a tantrum,and to make sure that every idiot out there who like to ruin TV shows for everyone and do not understand lore the great powers and destructive strengths that he suppose to have is because of divine powers that he forsake when he cut off his wings at that moment he should have become humans but because he is the first he keep a lot of his powers but slowly he began to lose them and becoming human and in the process opening himself to human emotions and everything back to what he was before falling from grace, I really do not care if it is not like the comics it is still a great work and a great TV show an something refreshing and fun to watch plot with no emotionally drama that makes people think twice before watching a TV show except for all those emotionally broken people who lost all theirs imagination- this does not include those that suffer a horrible experience or lost someone or suffer a terrible accident- this is for those that are fun and just like to mess everything up.

"Lucifer",2016-03-27," Searching for something to watch, I stumbled onto this show, at first watching out of the corner of my eye (while doing something else). I've now watched all available episodes at least twice and find myself waiting (impatiently) for the next -- which tells me the show is doing its job. The writing, acting, directing, editing -- super. The show makes me laugh -- and surprisingly, cry. With a light, unexpected touch, the series (through the use of metaphors) delves into issues, relationships, and a theme that is both timely and timeless; I don't feel like I'm watching a graphic novel. As the series gains its legs, the episodes just get better and better. Favorite so far is Episode Nine. No spoilers here, just an unveiled desire to see more -- more of the characters and episodes. I want to know where it's going and I'm pleased to see a new spin on a series -- even if it's genre is  cop show.  ","9"
"Lucifer",2016-03-25," Until Lucifer, Tom Ellis was unknown to me, but I instantly became a fan. I'm not a comic book fan, so I had no expectations on how the character would turn out. I went into the show with no prior knowledge and now I couldn't picture anyone else playing that role.He's such a witty and charming character, but also selfish. I love how they combined these traits and still makes you love him. People are throwing titles like  righteous  and  kind  to explain him, but I think there misjudging his intentions.On first glance you get the buddy cop feel with a twist. Something like Castle or Elementary. It is taking this route, but it is just a small part of the over all story.I cant end this review without talking about the comedy side of the show. By no means is it a comedy, but Lucifer's one liners will keep you entertained. Hes full of witty jokes and stories that he pulls out, sometimes at the worst point possible. Which just makes it all the more funny. ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-03-24," I really like this show! Stumbled onto it by accident. Didn't know what to expect. It's very loosely based on the DC comic character but the best way to watch it is for itself, rather than comparing it to the comic. I've been enjoying it a lot! Tom Ellis is perfect in the part of Lucifer, the devil who takes a holiday from Hell. Just devilish enough, just enough hints at how wicked he might actually be, but all the time with a devilish twinkle in his eye that makes him fascinating and likable in that way bad boys have of being likable. As the show progresses, his Lucifer character has gained complexity and depth that make him increasingly interesting.The plots are pretty straightforward procedural cop show, as are the stock characters: the beautiful detective, the guy who doesn't want to be a dirty cop, the guy who is a dirty cop, and the various peripherals. But there's a sub-plot developing, manipulated by his yin yang counter-part, the archangel Amenadiel (played by D. B. Woodside with elegant smoothness and an unexpected hint of the sinister), which gives a continuing line to the episodes and will test the loyalties of the characters - and keep the audience watching. I have a feeling it may end up being the cliffhanger at the end of the season.I find the show is at its best when it focuses on Lucifer himself. His charming bad boy persona is almost campy, but yet irresistible. And his moments of self-examination through the situations he gets into can be quite poignant. He doesn't understand the softer side of things, resents them, tries to subvert them, only to find sometimes he likes them, even needs them. And that could make him vulnerable. Tom Ellis does this with a subtlety that I find quite brilliant. As much as anything, I watch the show for him! I'm glad Fox (in Canada, it's on CTV) has given Lucifer the chance to find its footing, and I really hope they keep it going beyond this first season. ","9"
"Lucifer",2016-03-24," Easily the best series I've ever seen, the actors are flawless, the plots are magnificent. Do ignore all the negative reviewers as they are mostly Christian people getting angry be cause Satan this Satan that.... Great series, lots of humor, this series deserves nothing but love. The whole story about Satan being in the human world is just intriguing and mysterious, Episode after episode i want to watch more and more every time. Really entertaining, makes you think, makes you emotional... I can't help but say only good things about this series be cause it is a good series, huge fan here and recommend this to anyone who likes crime, mystery, and some devilish good fun. ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-03-23," All I can say is this series is the best program I've watched for a very long time. It's really funny, really addictive and quite unlike anything I've ever seen.The actors are outstanding and the plot is really well written. I hope so much that there is a series 2.I really like the idea of having the devil himself on earth and as he slowly becomes more mortal and has doubt about who he is and what his purpose is, the plot becomes ever more exciting as we see his contradictory need to punish collide with his fight for justice.I never thought Amazon prime would be as good as sky for series but this definitely makes it worth the prime cost by itself! ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-03-23," First when i heard about this show I didn't really know what to think about the story of Lucifer (the devil) who is taking a vacation from hell and ended up in Los Angeles helping a police detective solving cases.But so far this show has been one of the most interesting shows I've ever seen. It has it all, funny and interesting characters and a pretty carefully considered and formed story to go with it.The show contains a perfect mix of comedy, crime and fantasy, sometimes even a hint of romance. I would definitely recommend watching this show and its totally worth its 8 stars out of 10. ","8"
"Lucifer",2016-03-22,"  Lucifer  achieves its primary objective from the first episode. It makes you want to watch all episodes overnight even if you are not really into police series.Nice witty sense of humor from Lucifer and good performance by all actors. Mazikeen is my favorite!It is still very early, but the only thing that troubles me so far is how the writers are going to handle Lucifer's  mortality . From the first episode it was clear that Lucifer had a special connection with Det. Decker, the only human unaffected to his charms. So when he bled from her shot that was fine by me. Let's just hope he doesn't bleed from any random guy's shot. It is a delicate matter given the magnitude of the character.Another thing for consideration would be  Forms of punishment . Until now, when Lucifer wants to  punish  someone, he flashes his true face and the victim goes crazy. Depending on the nature of one's crime there could be other violent/intelligent options. ","9"
"Lucifer",2016-03-22," It's a fun show to watch. Love the cast, especially the devil. It looks like there are some things that are going to happen to make him a little deeper, but one of the parts I like is how shallow and self centered Lucifer is. I actually laugh out loud at a lot of the stuff he says and have come to really like his character as he shows a side of regret, redemption, forgiveness and caring as well as retribution and punishment. I've never read or even heard of the comics that other reviews mention so I can't comment on that. Overall one of the most enjoyable new series I've found in awhile and I hope it makes the cut. Geeze I can believe I've got to write another line just to get this in...give me a break. ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-03-22," I would have liked to have said that this is  just another odd-couple police procedural , of which there has been a large number of in recent years. Unfortunately, it falls short of even this low bar.It recasts the 'Prince of Darkness' as a whiny man-slut who, although his 'super power' is to force others to reveal their deepest darkest desire, is completely clueless as to the motivations of those around him, or even his own.The result is a self-indulgent incoherent mess.Any resemblance to the DC comic that it is purportedly 'based on' is limited to the title character's back-story, the name (but not personality) of his principal Hench-woman and the name of the LA nightclub he owns. ","1"
"Lucifer",2016-03-20," Do you know how many movies are out there that do no justice to the actual written works that they are based off of? And yet people still love them! Why can't people just enjoy something without having to base it off of something else? If it bothers you that much, I'm sorry. But if everyone boycotted a show or move simply because it didn't follow the same pattern as the book, comic, or graphic novel that the idea came from, no one would be enjoying anything out in theaters or on TV now. Recycling old ideas is the name of the game in todays industry. But, if the writer and creator are good enough, they can create a new spin on old news that can be just as good. That is, if people can just give it a chance. This show is funny, sexy and all around entertaining. So just sit back and enjoy the ride for the new show as it is. I hope this stays on the air long enough for me to actually get to enjoy it. I love Supernatural, and this is awesome too! ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-03-17," This television series is entertaining, and full of intrigue, yet it is misleading. Tom Ellis is almost perfect for the part of Azazel (fallen angel) since the  beast  out of Revelation 13 is British, yet will have roots in Israel. Though, this character that Tom Ellis portrays has been written by misleading writers. Yes, I know that some of this series is supposed to be  funny , but the Devil is not in Hell - he is busy trying to send people TOO HELL.. That is his goal. Also, the devil does not care about solving crime, though, he may meddle in it so that the wrong people get sent of the river so-to-speak. This show is interesting, yet the writers need to give the show more depth, as it is already serialized. Also, in this show Tom Ellis, aka,  the devil  is surrounded by beautiful women, and he seems to want to have sex with all of them.. but the real devil likes his sex violent, and he will have sex WITH ANYONE.. not just 'beautiful women'.. I gave this how an 8, as it has the potential to grow with plots. As a spiritual person I am, most of my colleagues thought I was nuts giving this show any high ratings whatsoever.. ","8"
"Lucifer",2016-03-16," Extremely disappointing, what a bad acting from all actors and actresses no exception. I was so thrilled at first but within 15 minutes of the pilot I realized how shallow and poorly written and performed it was, and it went on and on in the following episodes. Bring Back RUSH! Tom Ellis was much better in than this painful series of 30 minutes long episodes. It is a show with a great initial concept, but was very poorly executed, like what were they thinking, they just ruined what could have been a new thrilling and brilliant show. It surely does not deserve the rating other users are giving it, please let the production do something about it. Rush should have stayed on and Lucifer should get canceled. ","1"
"Lucifer",2016-03-16," I have been reading Lucifer. Concept and characters were brilliant. I am talking about Comic of course... And... I've started to watch this TV show with an optimistic expectation. It was funny at 1st episode... Then it got boring. And then ... totally destroyed the original characters and plot and everything... If you've read the comics... Stay away this show... it will ruin the originals image...So if you did not read the comic.. You can watch it as a police story with lots of nonsense. I have read some of the text so I know that actor Tom Ellis is very good actor. Actually its not about acting. They twisted the plot too much its unrecognizable... I think Tom Ellis is a good choice to play the Lucifer... He could play the character but they ruined the character with this plot. Frittering away the original taste... ","2"
"Lucifer",2016-03-15," I LOVE this show !! It has become my favourite TV show ! I look forward to Monday to watch Lucifer. The casting is brilliant. It is clever & witty. There are times I actually laugh out loud ! And Lucifer is devilishly delicious !!! (sorry) Lol He is arrogant but you love him. It's all about him but you love him. This show is like a breath of fresh air because it is so different. The psychiatrist lady is perfectly cast. And how they ever found such a perfect person to play Lucifer is amazing to me. Thank you to the creators of this show for bringing us a TV show that is exciting to watch. There are times I have to rewind just to hear some things over again because I am laughing so hard or because I am going  did he just say....?  It is a drama but with a cutting,funny edge.I absolutely love this show. Haven't been so excited about a TV show in a long time. ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-03-14," If the scripts improve this series is a keeper. So much fun....makes all the  Charmed  Alumni happy.Good writing, sexual tension...what more can a series want. Would like to see more about why Lucifer left  home ....and how he got kicked out of heaven...The real Lucifer, if he exists, could take lessons from Mr. Ellis....Lucifer needs to expand a bit, from the bar scene, and a few chases after criminals.Hate it to be just a one-note character....would the  devil  really be stuck chasing one human woman?Keep this show on, don't listen to the radical religious pundits....it's fun and games. ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-03-10," Lucifer is one of my favorite series. I love it because it destroys prejudices and because it is very tense. Dialogue between  devil  and people is hilarious and full of sarcasm. And it is very entertaining that Chloe still has no idea who is actually Lucifer even though it is under her nose. It is also intriguing that Lucifer can not  read  Chloe as all other people (it seems that Chloe has a surprise for us and for Lucifer) Although the story is about the devil we have the ability to see his bright side of Lucifer. The only bad thing is that the series only comes out once a weekAnd I would be angry if this series was canceled Like very angry :D ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-03-10," I often wonder why nobody looks at religion as the mythology it is. History has always been written by the winners! For once you get to see the other side of the story. Just hope it doesn't turn into a sappy drama in later episodes. So far this witty dialog and interesting story lines has caught my attention, and look forward to every Monday night TV time. When Lucifer Morningstar said  Thank you. Thank you, but lately I've been thinking. Do you think I'm the Devil because I'm inherently evil, or just because dear ol' dad decided I was?  I'm absolutely fascinated by Christianity mythology, and how they as a whole can pass things they do as  The devil made me do it  or  I had a moment of weakness  Just remember 1 simple little fact. The devil doesn't judge you for being human. ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-03-09," Why are people taking this so seriously - I love this show and cannot stop watching it over and over again for several reasons: it makes me laugh out loud, it has some interesting views on the bible and I very much enjoy Tom Ellis portrayal of Lucifer. One doesn't have to a accept the fact that the devil seems to actually maybe be a nice guy or that he seems to enjoy procedural cop shows but one has to appreciate the one-liners, the witty way to include some fun facts and tidbits, the excellent craftsmanship and the slow but steady built of the characters and the story. I would hate it if this shows potential (that certainly isn't really fulfilled but the last episode, wingman, definitely showed me that it can do at least my expectations justice) goes to waste because some people take fiction too serious and don't understand what  Lucifer  could be about. But I certainly hope that if the US won't make a 2nd season the BBC takes up the story and Tom Ellis and renew it with an even darker sense of humor. ","8"
"Lucifer",2016-03-09," OK, the devil is out for a vacation from hell and lives with human beings? He gets involved with cop stuff? Can this work?Hell yeah! Because this is surprisingly funny, deep, charismatic, interesting and sometimes evil. I love Lucifer, always being honest and true to himself. At first I really did not know how this cop series could be taken serious and how I would want to watch more than one episode. And here we are, I cannot wait to see the next one. Don't get me wrong, this is not the bible and I have seen surely better things in my life, but this is entertainment at its best and I cannot wait to see more. ","9"
"Lucifer",2016-03-08," I read online a article that stated a million mothers want this show canceled and I think that you would have to be stupid if you think this TV show would influence your children into believing that devil is good, or whatever their problem is with the show is.The main character Lucifer is played light and charismatic rather than a heavy being. I like Lucifer & Mazikeen & Amenadiel characters. I do like Chloe & Dan & Linda & Trixie characters but think the show would be better if it was less focused on them.My best friend likes Maze & Amenadiel dynamic but she hates Chole and tells me all the time that she looks like a model not a cop. She will only watch Lucifer for a few minutes she says the writing is awful, she'll switch to another show, and then she will ask me what happened in a episode. She is a huge fan of Buffy the Vampire Slayer and we both agree Joss Whedon had scarier evil characters and better writing. ","7"
"Lucifer",2016-03-07," The first two or three episodes of this series were just meh for me but the last few episodes were just amazing...It really develops Lucifer as a character and not just as the lord of hell...It shows his vulnerable side and his feelings too...I feel that this series has the potential to be a great one just like the flash...If you remember correctly, then the first few episodes of the flash weren't that good but it really took off after the 10th episode or so...For me, Tom Ellis has been magnificent...He is the reverse flash of this show...The one character that makes you want to watch one more episode...Plus the show doesn't have a lot of cgi and hence looks a lot better that the flash did at this junction...Overall, I feel like the best time to start watching this show is now ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-03-06," Was interested to see what they would be with this show. The humor in the show got old very quickly for me, and the main character playing Lucifer I just find annoying, not the badass I was expecting. Having the ultimate embodiment of evil (or freedom, depending on how you see it) resort to solving petty crimes in LA is an enormous waste of potential. The back story is mildly interesting, but developing too slowly, and I'm afraid it will just be predictable. The stories would be interesting, if it were about a normal human. Using Lucifer here was a huge waste. Throw in horsemen of the apocalypse or something. Worth watching to see, but loses its appeal quickly. ","5"
"Lucifer",2016-03-06," I'm so tired of LA taking a really good comic book and turning in to a lousy film or TV-series without even understanding the point and the depth of the original story.Lucifer shares the same faith as many Alan Moore screen adaptations (with a few exceptions like  Watchmen ) - well made, shallow, boring, funny, totally lacking the esoteric and spiritual understanding. Like taking out the Force off the Star Wars.Reducing the first born of the angelic host to a LAPD consultant in CSI style just asks for fast forwarding onto some real content that never seems to arrive. I miss the intrigue, the intelligence and the depth of the original story: free will vs pre-destination, the Luciferian gift of understanding the good-evil, the complexity of human co-creation. All the juice.Out of the respect of film makers I tend to give even shitty films a chance and watch them through but Lucifer is just too damn boring - all those resources wasted on a making the original story worse.I really hope that the main story line would borrow more from to the comic book story line and take the series to next level. ","1"
"Lucifer",2016-03-05," Well, this one is a Brit, and when it comes to hotness, Fox graced us with the most lame slogan there is: <U+0084>Hot as hell. . Not that he is not <U+0096> Tom Ellis in this TV series is really a man to fall for. But can he save the show itself from falling? Because let's face it, Gaiman's character is the reason why we're all watching this. The mischievous, bored Majesty of Hell seeks change from the routine in the City of Angels, in which he makes a name by starting a club. That's the idea. The portrayal in Fox series is quite pleasant, not only to look at, but also to listen to. I'm not talking about the British accent here (but let's be honest, if the devil walks among us and wants to be as classy as human form allows, he's gonna speak British), but the replicas he was given. The sarcastic and contemptuous, yet funny and delightfully charming persona promises hopeful conversations, if he's given at least a bit capable partner to play off. The outright honesty with witch Lucifer calls himself by his true name and the childish joy with which he tells everyone is a brilliant and yet logical move. Why would Satan need to weave a mystery about himself? Thank God, that did not happen here and we're allowed to laugh at all his comments about the things between Earth and Heaven, or in heaven, that is. Thank you for not messing the main character up, FOX.But you can't unsee the main premise no matter how damn sexy the devil is. Seven minutes into Pilot we learn that he starts to feel compassion when he gives a good and not at all satanic advice to the apparently dumb and untalented singer-star he obviously didn't have any deeper feelings for before. Not a minute later he becomes the second Bones to a Booth who is a detective with <U+0084>inherent good  in her. Let us all guess, FOX, she's immune to him, he is fascinated as to why and they both fall in love by season two. If there will be any. Because guys, you can't drag a boring crime procedural drama (of which we already have tons) just because the LAPD's little helper is a Prince of Darkness. Okay, let's go with the horribly wrong idea that the Devil himself can't resist the first slightly good person he meets and starts falling apart and being all sensitive and turning to the Light side because they have cookies and green light-sabers. Because that's why he came to the City of Angels for, forgiveness and reclamation of his seraphic status. The Devil. Anyways, a nice idea presents itself, and that's an idea of confused little Morningstar finding help at a psychologist's. Of course he doesn't admit he needs help, but he still doesn't use his diabolic powers to stop the brave woman from baring his soul to him. I am pretty inclined for this concept to work, if only it was followed through as an interesting idea it is, and not used just as a filling. Another thing which may put this series six feet under is the non existing capability of making a decision. There was once a detective Dancer who had a LAPD ex-husband portrayed by Nicolas Gonzales, whom she disliked quite a bit. And a daughter who took after him in appearance quite a bit. In second episode, however, there is a detective Decker who's ex- husband is a metro-sexual and uninteresting white male and who seems to be cooperating with him just fine. The daughter is, fortunately, the same, although I have to wonder if her mother doesn't lie to her father about something. Personally, I hate when people do recasting and rewriting after the episode was aired. It's absolutely okay to have an alternative Pilot like Sherlock did, which proposed a different theory on a case, but how the hell are you not sure about your main character's name? There is one name that sounds right, and that's because it's an original from the comic books, and that is the Archangel Amenadiel. His hatred for his fallen brother is exactly what it needs to be, and his message is clear: Get the hell back to hell, or all hell breaks loose. Which means that however much I like the time-slowing every time this messenger comes to scene, there should be an effect to his visits (or we just erase him like detective Dancer from the first episode). I imagine we have two options here, either Lucifer sets his heart on staying and then we'll soon have Sam, Dean and Castiel arriving to help with the hordes, or he leaves and we'll have no show. Basically, are the makers strong enough to pull off a crime procedural fantasy horror supernatural haunting show? There's another thing that gives us solid two options of continuing, and that is the question of our inherently good detective finding out that Lucifer doesn't, in fact, lie about his identity. I don't recommend the creators to let her ignore the fact, because then they would have to re-do the first episode over one more time. I give detective Dancer, as a reasonable person, two more episodes to get her mind around the fact that Lucifer is, indeed, Lucifer. Then she, as a reasonable person, gets the hell out of Los Angeles and hides for her and her daughter's life. Or she could be a strong bad-ass female character and fight The Evil, but well, that includes the Winchesters or Halliwells again. Let me tell you what I conclude. I conclude we will watch this in the hours of the worst boredom for the sole reason of the glorious sarcasm, accent and body of the Prince of Lies and still will be bored while watching. And for Devil's sake, get the angles of firing a gun right! ","4"
"Lucifer",2016-03-05," The show is something everyone should give a try. Tom Ellis is extremely charming and absolutely perfect for the role and Lauren German is amazing also. The chemistry between them is perfect and I can't wait to see what grows(or doesn't) of them. Lesley-Ann Brandt is perfect for the role of Mazikeen, she is mysterious and also like an open book at the same time. The show is full of funny moments and after watching it you are never left feeling bad or sad. It's the perfect show for Monday nights as everyone needs to relax and take their mind off the first day of work after the weekend. It's also great for binge-watching. The only bad thing about this show is that when the episode finishes you are left needing more. You just can't get enough of it, thats how good it is. A lot of people are complaining that it is not like it was in the comic books, but I think that regardless of that it is great. The comics were good the show is good, what is there too complain about? Nothing. It is pure perfection. Like it was sent down form heaven :) ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-03-05," (spoiler ahead) I absolutely love the show. I totally recommend it to people who are into supernatural (demon & god kinda thing) and crime frighting,then this is the show for you. I personally like supernatural and i liked crinimal minds and when i saw the first episode i really enjoyed it. I love all the mysteries and thrill through out the show and i love the protagonist ideal and how some things change through the show. I love how lucifers plays with inmortality at the beginning and mortality at the end. I cannot wait until the next episode Monday of the 7th. And in my honest opinion i have been a walking dead fan since the very 1st episode and i do not believe that zombie will exist in the near future and with this show i do not believe in gods, demons, and angels but in this show i have enjoyed how it was created. I know the basics of how the immortal works but i love how lucifer wants to expirence even mortality ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-03-04," This is the show that I don't want to stop watching right after the pilot. In the beginning it seemed a bit 'like thousands before', but Tom Ellis's Lucifer made me waiting desperately for the new episodes. Maybe the plot itself is not a brilliant thing, but the character definitely is, and after several episodes it became a way more intriguing. It is very interesting to watch over Lucifer in our everyday life, his reactions, decisions he's making, relationship with others. The mimics of the Devil are priceless, especially when he is experiencing strong emotions. Tom Ellis seems to be almost a perfect Devil, having a bit of humor, a bit of anger, a bit of careless way of thinking, and certainly the sexiest character of the show. Unfortunately, I can't say the same about the 'detectives', but there are another good characters, like Linda, played by Rachael Harris, and Trixie's interaction with Lucifer makes me smile every time I see it. Sad, but Mazikeen and Amenadiel could have been made more 'live' and not so plain.If you don't compare the show with the original comics and just want to have fun (because the TV shows are fun at first place!), I'd recommend to watch 'Lucifer'. ","9"
"Lucifer",2016-03-02," Whoever did the casting for this show really fell short of the mark, they had a chance to make something as good as Forever and they failed, mainly due to the actors: Tom Ellis - he doesn't do bad, but we all know he can do better (Miranda), here he seems to be coasting along waiting for the show to be cancelled, if he is hoping this will launch his Hollywood career he needs to be given more freedom to show what he can do.Lauren German - is trying, but really doesn't seem to be enjoying the role, I am not sure if this is due to the script or her limitations, not having seen her in anything else, I cannot say which.Kevin Aljendro - In Arrow he showed what he can do, he really seemed to enjoy playing Blood, yet in Lucifer he is irritating, I've a feeling he is here for the cash, after all, everyone has bills to pay.lesley-Ann Brandt - now I have to admit I like her, I think the writers really need to give her more screen time and to develop her character more, we know from Spartacus & Librarians she is not a half bad actress, I would rather she been given the role which Lauren German was given to be honest.D.B Woodside - he doesn't do bad in this role, but I think he could do more to convince me he is the irked angel he is meant to be.Rachel Harris - sorry but I really can't stand her, her character is irking the hell out of me and her acting is terrible at the least.But for all it short comings in casting, it is an enjoyable show on the whole, it could be better, hopefully having seen the recent episode (six) it is the start of a story arc that will make the show stand out of being another cop show.

"Lucifer",2016-03-01," Love this supernatural series. The Devil, played by Tom Ellis; à Devil you only wished hè made you do it, is on à holiday from hell in Los Angeles. Where else. All the characters have been deepend out just enough. We have the lovable detective Chloe Decker and her ex husband also à detective and their lovely daughter, Maze the devilish helper, an archangel who wants Lucifer back in hell, à horny shrink and of course the Devil, Lucifer Morningstar. Lucifer stands out of the crowd; hè is arrogant, ignorant and repulsive. But you have to love him and even feel for him. His plays are so recognicible devilish, emotional and funny. He feels rejected by his Father, so When hè shows his emotion, in à round with à shrink, you would want to redeem him yourself and go to hell and back for him. The story lines are easy to follow and with à biblist twist. Well done Tom Ellis and you can perform à more than decent Sinner Man. I highly recommend this series!! ","9"
"Lucifer",2016-02-29," The first 2 episodes : Stellar! Marvelous ! The devil's done a good job (quite literally) BUT whilst the whole   What's your deepest desire  thing works the first couple of times, it starts to get a little bit cheesy! Over all except the Tom Ellis, the acting and dialogue delivery is pretty mediocre for the rest of the cast. The whole I- am- the- strong- feminist- can- take- care- of- myself- yet- being- SO- HOT -lead Detective Deker doesn't really work quite well beyond the first , oh wait, no it doesn't work, like ever. Each episode very repetitive, there is a case, they always get the wrong guy but Chole has that  gut feeling ,in the end there is a twist which Chloe gets just at the last moment and voilà! Case solved. We've seen Lucifer show his real face quite a few times but before we get to see the full depth of his power and skills ... he becomes MORTAL!WTF!? If I as a viewer can start guessing whats going to happen in the rest of the episode, I'm just not going to watch it anymore.True, I have written this only 6 episodes in ,but rarely do I find myself watching a new series falling into a pattern so quickly! The story writers really need to amp up , given the fierce competition within Networks and many shows getting dropped after one season only. All hope may not be lost though, specially if they explore the whole Amanadiel-Mazikeen- AND Lucifer being the DEVIL DEVIL he is meant to be (not just limited to women succumbing to his devilish charms and jumping into bed- that's getting a bit old). Frankly, give it a shot and judge for yourself and you won't fail to notice that Tom Ellis has done a fantastic job as Satan! ","7"
"Lucifer",2016-02-26," It is slow and dry like the Expanse, but the comments from Lucifer are funny. Lucifer helping out a female detective to solve cases and being Lucifer, he does not care how to get the answers as long as he gets them. The thing that vexes him is the female detective who resists his charms. I am surprised that this is under the DC logo, especially since it is a no-name character. There are many characters in the comic world to put on the tube, what made them pick this?? Lucifer's quips are funny, but that's it. The comic characters I know are from the Justic League, but taking Lucifer and making it a TV show? Big name producers making something like this. This show is for when you want to kill time, mindless entertainment. ","5"
"Lucifer",2016-02-26," Seriously.... This is a blatant ripoff off Castle..... Charming rich guy charms his way into becoming a consultant for the police... The only person he cant charm right off the bat, is the female cop, exactly like Castle couldn't charm Beckett to begin with.....Now, its no longer a novelist, but the devil that its focused around. The base story is however EXACTLY the same. Tom Kapinos is a bloody hack, stealing the base line of a major show and puts a spin on it and calls it new....... He should be ashamed and Andrew W. Marlowe should sue his ass.That being said. For a spin-off its pretty good, If only he hadn't stolen the setup from Castle.... A new take on the devil, a little morbid and then again not so much, the humor is good, acting is great. To bad its all a ripoff....... Is it worth seeing? Yea, sure, if you need to blow off some time, its OK. Just don't expect something new..... ","4"
"Lucifer",2016-02-24," This is a light hearted show which is well executed to while away an hour. It doesn't stand up to scrutiny too closely but I don't think it's claiming to be anything too deep and doesn't take itself too seriously. Although I should confess that a crush on the lead actor in this show which does slightly compromise my objectivity!It's main draw is Tom Ellis playing the lead with a mixture of suave coolness and quick funny quips that we would all love to deliver but only think of afterwards. He verges on Carry-On British humour at times but seems to be pulling it off. His lady LA cop; Chloe is also a strong character played well and liable which isn't that easy faced with an opposite character that gets all the fun bits. There is lots of humour and things going on that you would love to do if you were immortal and could get away with anything. The script feels well written in terms of conversations and pace. I think the mysteries are a bit simple and luckily each line of enquiry neatly leads into the next one. But as they have just a 45 minutes to solve each mystery satisfactorily, it needs to be fairly uncomplicated. And just enough is given away for viewers to solve it almost at the same time. I watch shows like Murdoch Mysteries and some British mystery shows like Rosemary & Thyme, Father Brown and this is similar in style.The difficulty is that I simply don't believe that anyone who isn't police would get near crime scenes, suspects, information, police cells or be let within 100 yards of anything crime related without getting arrested themselves. Bones gets around it as she supports the police. Elementary, because they are private detectives. Agatha Christie heros and heroines because it was all a little less tight in the 1950s. But in the modern day, Lucifer manages to get around everything by being seductive, looking them in the eye and asking people what it is they really desire, momentarily debilitating their rational thought. I personally would certainly fall foul of this approach. But I'm not sure if it washes with viewers who don't feel the same as me about the actor. And I wonder if it will become too repetitive to be used numerous times in every episode eventually. The show appears to be self conscious of this making a joke early on about him not being a Jedi so again, maybe this will still work long term but I'm unsure.Having said that, I was intrigued enough to watch the first 3 in a row. And liked the story arcs of him gradually revealing supernatural skills, Chloe investigating these to look for plausible explanations, Chloe's daughter (pleasingly not revoltingly cutesy) and ex-husband, his ongoing puzzlement that Chloe doesn't fall under his spell like everyone else and the fact that God is annoyed and sends an angel messenger with various warnings about what will happen if Lucifer doesn't resume his job in hell. I hope the writers have thought these through & I currently look forward to the next ones. ","8"
"Lucifer",2016-02-23," I love this show! I just hope they don't make Lucifer too much of a weakling, as seems to be the going trend these days with heroes and superheroes. I love the wit! The acting is great. Still, the writers need to keep Lucifer a little dangerous. Otherwise, they are going to ruin a very good show. I am not the only fan of this show who feels this way. Don't ruin it! Keep Lucifer a little scary. Please!The first show was awesome. The second and third still good, but now it is going downhill a bit. Please bring Lucifer back to a somewhat scary fellow. I fully intend to keep watching it, though, as long as it is own, as the theme is refreshing. So far, as I said, I love it! ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-02-23," If Lucifer was not a freelance detective working with the police(?!?!) I was really hyped to see a show about the Devil mingling with humans and to see it from his perspective but this show is not about that. In the sea of a  main guy  and his  female cop/fed partner  shows this one feels redundant.Sad to see a potentially good show go to waste just because the studio wanted to make money. I will not say avoid the show. Watch it and see why it is not anything to be excited about.Fox makes good comedy and they should stick with it this is a waste of resources. ","5"
"Lucifer",2016-02-23," Interesting but highly unlikely premise based on Neil Gaiman's SANDMAN in which Lucifer decides to move to L.A. and give up his throne in Hell. throwing the natural balance of things out of order. Worst Yet after a girl dies in his arms a victim of a drive by shooting The Devil decides to play Avenger. He becomes smitten with the female detective in charge of the case. This fascination leads him into further investigations with her .Even if she ants his help or not. Lucifer owns and runs a nightclub along with his bodyguard Maze Lucifer has a Arc angel from Heaven telling him he must go back to Hell to maintain the balance of things. the Devil on the other hand refuses he is having too much fun dealing out Justice and punishing the Guilty. not to mention the Female Cop who seems to have captured his libido if not his heart.A Fun premise but a highly unlikely one. As fun as this series is I find it difficult to accept the premise Of The Devil leaving Hell to become a  Good Guy  when the Devil as we know him is full of hate and rage add to the fact that he despises us with a vengeance and cannot wait to destroy us.The Real Life Devil always comes to mind and takes away the enjoyment of the show. As A Fluff piece its worth a bag of popcorn to sit back and watch it and enjoy it. Its not a serious Show by any means so put your brain on hold your beliefs in neutral for a bit and watch. As Far as Entertainment goes it does its job. And it does it well. ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-02-22," I don't know why, but i REALLY hate this show. I just do. If you like it, good for you. It doesn't make you a bad person. But i really despise this show.First of all, why is Lucifer, the devil, the lord of all darkness, for lack of a better word, fighting crime? I understand this is based off of a comic book, but just make him a super villain. Why does he care if people are being murdered? He's the DEVIL!!!! Maybe it's just because of my Catholic background that i'm so mad about this, but, Jesus, it's just stupid! And also, why does nobody in the show give a reaction when he reveals himself to be the devil. They should either laugh at his face, or defecate into their pants!Again, if you like this show, fine, but don't try to make me think it's entertaining. ","1"
"Lucifer",2016-02-22," When I started watching this show, I had fairly high interests and high hope. It is something intriguing: a demon living among us, and yet play along with mundane human beings. It would be a very good show. If they can portrait the demon as a, well, demon.Four episodes later, I felt a little blah in my mouth. If this is the demon, the one condemned, the one rules the hell, then what the hell would underworld look like? Retirement home? A total of, I don't know, twice an episode maybe, that Lucifer shows his evil side here and there. Maybe  Evil  is even a little heavy word to describe him.  Naughty ,  Cynical  are probably better words. None of which is hardly anything diabolical that I'd imagine the arch-devil of all should exhibit. Even if he is in love (question mark) with Chloe. The only thing I see so far is his bullet-proof (except being shot by Chloe) super power (besides his unstoppable charm to attract women). He may as well just be an above average rich dude wearing a bullet-proof vest.I'd still watch it, but I am starting to feel this is going downhill for the  evil . Make him bad. Make him diabolical. Make him Lucifer. ","5"
"Lucifer",2016-02-20," oh my god, this show had so much potential. The stars are good, and well played but the Lucifer character is nowhere near dark enough. He is supposed to be the devil! Instead you get this rubbish. There is almost no violence, no nudity, no blood, no hope. They really need to make it darker for season 2 if it makes it that far. This is more like a watered down crime show then anything that deals with the devil. He may as well be just someone with a few special powers, because he is no way someone that is supposed to be the ruler of the underworld, even if he is reformed. Here's hoping that they do a rethink before the show gets canned. Update, starting to get a bit better by episode 4 but still got a way to go. ","2"
"Lucifer",2016-02-20," So disappointed in the casting of  Lucifer  - firstly he's not handsome enough, he comes off quite camp-ish. Where's the evil? Where is the diabolical? Why should I care that he's becoming  human  when I haven't seen him be a bad ass demon?He's more like Russel Brands character of obnoxious 'Arthur' than the Prine of Darkness. There is nothing I find dark or sexually appealing about him. He's reminds me of the gay foster brother in 'Orphan Black'.You want to see a real bad guy that you grow fond of - Joseph Morgan's character of Nikolass the original vampire in The Originals. Now that is a character I can watch!!!Overall I think this show had great potential but they flopped with casting and it's a semi- supernatural cop show like The Mentalist - except Lucifer had a fraction of the acting talent. ","2"
"Lucifer",2016-02-19," They changed the guy that played the husband in the Pilot originally and re-shot it with a new guy. Why??? The original worked a lot better than the new guy and Gonzalos had a much better rapport with the cast Plus - two bluish green eyed people can't have a dark brown eyed child. You had better write the original guy back into the show somehow and come up with a reason why it's really his kid so we can believe it. I purchased the Pilot on HD for 2.99 and I was very disappointed because I was expecting the original husband. This new guy is a bummer to me. What happened to make the change? But I do so love the show. Plus I was hoping you would reuse the guy that played the rapper in the Pilot. He was excellent. The chemistry between German and Ellis is fantastic. The show seems to be depending on guest actors that are not very good. I love this show so get some better actors. Through the first 4 episodes I had no complaints with actors in the Pilot but from episodes 2 - 4 there is a lot to be desired. ","9"
"Lucifer",2016-02-02," Really awful. Yes it took me the entirety of the pilot to get past the point that the only thing this show shares with one of my favorite comic books was the name, but then I watched the next one with an open mind...  Let's give it a chance,  I thought, Maybe it's good for it's own reasons. Maybe they've done something interesting by changing all the characters and the premise and the general tone and atmosphere They haven't. It's entirely too glib, their version of Lucifer is classless a 2D character trying desperately to pretend he has depth, the humor is juvenile, and nothing stands in the way of this being a descent show more than their insistence that it be another run of the mill procedural drama (except where's the drama?) with a devil who's being treated more like an underpowered superhero than a cosmic being.If you're going to adapt a character as fleshed out and nuanced as the Lucifer we see in Mike Carey's comic, you have to do a much better job than this. It just seems like every aspect of this show, most notably the writing and acting, is being phoned in with no attention paid to quality. Try harder, do better, and if you want to make cheap, artificial, Hollywood crap, don't drag something better than what you're making down with you. This could just as easily have been unconnected to the comic and I would have completely ignored it after seeing how awful it was. Since I know the source material has given them so much more to work with, I see it as a major failure. ","1"
"Lucifer",2016-02-02," i have to say plot is amazing.And cast is amazing specially tom Ellis,he is always fun to watch.i saw him first time on rush. although i don't understand why did USA network cancel the show it was crazy fun.Far from menacing, Lucifer is a magnetic gentleman. He wears nice suits, talks in charming accent and is very manipulative. The way he is displayed here hinges a lot on persuasion. He oozes confident, able to affect others with ease but without being overly callous or arrogant. Tom Ellis just struts as though he embraces the characters, the confidence is nearly infectious.Well Lucifer is on the great start. nice job with script. great job from director. little room for improvement. but great show which i haven't seen in while on American television. i hope it does great. ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-02-02," Assuming you're not fuming at the mere thought of showing the devil in a TV show, you'll realize that it's fertile ground for some great stories. It's still finding it's feet but has some of the quirkiness of the comics that introduced this character in the first place. The production values are pretty low but they don't need fancy effects - the premise should be intriguing enough really. All actors carry their weight and there's enough character building to hint at more fun to come. Give it a chance - with Neil Gaimans involvement it deserves it. Escapist stuff but I like it - a hell of a lot more than boring a CSI procedural... ","9"
"Lucifer",2016-01-31," There's a bunch of people who will look at this expecting to see the Graphic Novel Series LUCIFER played out on the screen.People...you should know better.We're now in TV-Land. And TV-land is VERY wary about upsetting a particularly LARGE segment of the population for whom the Word 'Lucifer' is cause for apocalyptic prayers. And to put on the screen the actual, complicated philosophical, ecclesiastical, existential, moral and A-moral questions posed by the novel's WHITE-haired anti-hero vis-a-vis what was REALLY behind the War in Heaven? To put into a weekly TV show something that FAILS to faithfully check off every accepted and expected TV tropes for Demons & Evil and Heaven & Hell? No, folks, the TV executives are NOT brave enough to do that. There are still some deep, hi-voltage topics they will avoid like kryptonite.That's not to say THIS Lucifer isn't entertaining. I found it entertaining and amusing...in a DietCoke kind of way. If you never read the Carey series...Watch this first. Let it entertain you. It will! THEN...read the original.Again...I liked it. I accept Tom Ellis's interpretation of Samael's personality and am willing to run with the Police Story Detective match-up. Who knows, maybe this series will take the route of the 'Dresden Files'. Who knows? I'm willing to give it a watch. ","7"
"Lucifer",2016-01-31," How tragically sad it is that some TV viewers consider this to be in any way creative, artistic or inspiring. What low standards!!! After happening to some across this, and viewing 15 minutes of such typical Trash A Vision, I felt sick and changed the channel. This is boring, typical TV and vile. I am still recovering. Do producers actually think that shocking us with blow jobs and new ways of displaying violence against women is what viewers want? What a waste of time on the part of anybody involved with this. Don't waste your time or any bit of your good heart or valuable time with this low quality junk. 'So done with the overwhelming vast majority of TV folks. ","1"
"Lucifer",2016-01-30," I can not believe the premise of this show, who pitched this? have they completely ran out of ideas for cop shows, Police Officers have been teamed up with ghost, dogs, puppets, and even their mothers, now wait for it, now we have Lucifer the king of Hell. I have seen this done better in a movie called Horns, if this was a comedy I would completely understand but its not funny, its not fantasy, because who would fantasies about this lame pair up. Stop or the devil will shoot, the devil leaves hell because he no longer wants to play the part God has given him, OK, then he decides to play gum shoe to revenge the death of some random human that I guess we should just guest she means something to him, his partner even tells him stop caring your the Devil, AWWWWW! Terrible show. ","2"
"Lucifer",2016-01-30," It's good to see Vertigo titles getting green-lit for the small screen, however they tend to have poor ratings or at times their screenwriters were unable to keep to the comics books mythologies. The well-intended Constantine TV series, for example, had its protagonist staying relatively close to its comics book's persona (compared to the Keanu Reeves' movie version). But alas, that show got canned after lukewarm receptions on its 1st Season. It was a tragic attempt at serializing one of the great graphic literatures for the television.NBC's Constantine stayed remarkably close to its comics counterpart, albeit the character's motives and moral compass were adjusted to make him more palatable to the general audience. Similarly, Fox's Lucifer had been turned into a mutated clone of its superior comics version. For instance, in the pilot episode we see Lucifer Morningstar partners up with a detective to solve mundane crimes because he 'cares' about humanity. Then there is the sub-plot involving his growing (dis)affection to the said detective's juvenile daughter. The characterization feels disingenuous, awkward and makes no sense at all. In fact, Fox's Lucifer is a pale facsimile of the truly intriguing character, first created by Neil Gaiman, and later fully fleshed out by Mike Carey. In the comics series you became immersed in the esoteric underworking of the spiritual realms, and even sympathize with the Devil because of you begin to care about his journey and storyline. In the series he stayed true to his evil origin and antagonistic nature towards God. But you begin to understand his struggle and indifference to humanity, as these reflect our own journeys as human beings faced with our daily sufferings and challenges.In fact, the character of Lucifer (in the comics) is a reflection of our own foibles and failings as a species.Gone were the white clothing, the blonde hair, the elegant and devilishly classy demeanor that made Lucifer character one of the most enduring comics book personalities. It would be interesting to see how the story pans out too, as the consistently well-written Vertigo title lies heavily on its supernatural themes, whereas the TV version seems adamant on making Lucifer as mundane as it gets.His classy jazz club had been turned into a strange pub-cum-strip-joint. The mysterious and strong Mazikeen in the TV series became a whiny and lusty bartender. Whilst in the comics, Morningstar couldn't care less about the fate of humanity and would rather spend his days playing the piano and singing in his club, Tom Ellis' portrayal of him is too flamboyant and too eager to care/help humans. He is filled with so much lust and sleaze, that he would make a used-car salesman or a pimp blush.I feel that the 42-min pilot had almost no resemblance to its source, except at a superficial level. It is a hollow adaptation that betrays the high quality storytelling that made both Neil Gaiman and Mike Carey's writings great. ","4"
"Lucifer",2016-01-30," I'm actually surprised by this TV series.I didn't expect much out of it before it came out , thought it was gonna be some low-tier rubbish , but it positively surprised me.It's quite refreshing and it has a great balance between an original and unique story mixed with some nice one-liners which are actually rare these days since you usually see forced humor. This one has a nice feeling to it , really natural and spontaneous.Great series judging by the first episode , hope it will continue being this way and hope the story will get more and more intriguing as it follows.Can't wait to see the next episodes(the 2nd comes out tomorrow as well!) , this might be one of the best series this year. ","8"
"Lucifer",2016-01-30," This show is absolutely FABULOUS. I loved it so much that this is my first ever review on this site. Tom Ellis is charisma personified. I was grinning watching him for the whole episode. Terrific writing and hilarious one-liners. Best TV experience I've had in years.I was hooked the minute I heard the opening music and saw his mischievous grin when the cop was pulling him over. Lucifer delivers his lines with the perfect tones and facial expressions. Everything from sticking it to Amenadiel when requested to return to Hell to his banter with Chloe's daughter when she's in trouble at school. I almost choked laughing when he enters 2 Vile's home telling them to turn off the  God awful  music.I watched it twice to make sure I caught all of the dialogue =) ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-01-29," We have seen psychics, wizards, immortals, mentalists, super heroes and god knows what else - nearly every single thing one can imagine, put in a cop show solving the same old crimes. The only real crime though is their lack of creativity and their inability to build the series around a different and a fresher framework other than the classic ones. Personally, I am fed up with nearly every series out there being either a teen drama or a regular cop show, with the only thing differentiating them being a cheap thematic  paint job  on their surface, while their core remains the same. Perhaps it is a little too early to put  Lucifer  in that category, but if history (and its pilot) is any indication, I can only assume that it's really not any different. Assumptions aside, the main character is smoothly depicted, acting is decent - actors not so much in my opinion. Lucifer, for instance, following yet another cliché, is paired with the typical super model-like female cop. The actor himself though does show promise. As usual, there is also a main story (which is almost always more of a backstory in this kind of series) which seems to hold some interest. But not having this story progress in the pace of a snail (as, again, it usually does), would be a refreshing change indeed.In the end, I believe Lucifer's true colors will show in the next 3- 4 episodes, at most. Hopefully, it will surprise me pleasantly and will be the exception to the rule. ","5"
"Lucifer",2016-01-28," When I saw who was in this I decided to give it a chance. Now I am so glad I did because this very well might be my favourite TV show. The cast, in my opinion, is perfect and the music that was used fit so well. Seeing Tom Ellis play a character so different from Gary Preston (Miranda)and pulling it off so brilliantly excites me more than I can say. I was hooked from the beginning to the end. It's odd to say this but.... I love Lucifer. I never imagined that Tom Ellis could actually take such a well known (and hated)character and make it lovable. I am looking forward to see where this show goes and I hope that it'll continue to be as amazing in later episodes as it was in the first. ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-01-28," Something moronic like this can invent only Americans. For some, this show will act as harmless fun, but the intention of the series is clearly not only fun but also a glorification of evil. In the world, especially in America, Satanism is a very widespread and popular. And they do not believe in some imaginary evil, no, they really believe in the real evil and worship him. And then to the public they are saying that evil does not exist and that it was all just a big hoax. The real deception is in fact that it is through these series wants to tell the people that evil does not exist and that it is actually sweet. So find a charming actor, and throw in a couple of  bad  clever dialogue, so that the evil became charming, seductive. Slowly, as the series progresses, you will see that the intention of these  harmless  show do just that - erasing the line between good and evil and finally you will became a passive moron. ","1"
"Lucifer",2016-01-28," I have been underwhelmed by most of the new shows in the past 12 months. Lucifer was a complete and welcome surprise. The interplay of the actors is completely natural for a cast that is new to each other. The casting of Ellis as Lucifer is perfect. Loved the soundtrack opening with Ain't No Rest for the Wicked by Cage the Elephant and finishing with Always Something by the same band. Doesn't hurt he's driving a classic black stingray convertible. I am hooked. So glad it is LA and not Vegas. I hope they can keep up the humor over a season and that it can keep from being patronizing or moralistic (which I suspect many of the negative reviewers would appreciate). Interesting that the spectrum seems to be 8 to 10 stars or 1 to 2. If this show is a 1, please point me to the show on network television that is a 10. ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-01-26," I really don't understand the negative reviews of this extremely entertaining TV series. Bad acting? Really? Tom Ellis bad actor? Really? Are we watching the same show? Great entertainment, excellent acting, excellent casting, excellent chemistry between the leads, excellent pacing, and a few more 'excellents' that you'll either appreciate or simply not notice. Just another cop show as someone commented? The 'cops and robbers' is the backdrop theme and just as the 'cowboys and injuns' backdrop was used to convey countless excellent entertaining stories ranging from the truly gritty to the utterly comical, Lucifer succeeds admirably in conveying a fresh and light-hearted comedic drama that obviously uses the 'cops and robbers' theme as a very general backdrop. Incidentally, what is wrong with having another good 'cop' TV show anyway, or another good 'sci-fi' TV show? Or another 'about anything' good new TV show? Heaven knows (pun intended) we have enough bad ones. For me this was one of the best pilots for quite a while; I enjoyed it as much as the new X-Files pilot. Put two pretty much unknown leads into the X-Files and see how it goes down with viewers - I'd guess it'd go pretty badly. Lucifer is a success right from the start with a very fresh understated approach. My guess is that viewers will either love it or hate it and there will be little middle ground. I loved it and it is most definitely on my 'can't wait for the next episode' list but your mileage may vary. As is so rightly said, different strokes and all that. ","10"
"Lucifer",2016-01-26," The show is very entertaining and the actor is extremely handsome and charming. But the storyline's main plot has been repeated over and over in other TV shows. Several TV shows such as Forever, Constantine, and Elementary, etc. have shown a very charming British character that has a female cop aiding him. Can't the writers be more original and come up with something else? Anyway, I probably will continue to watch it because the main character is so cute. I hope religious nuts don't have a cow and begin to scream that the show is blasphemy simply because the subject deals with Lucifer and the angels. It's just a basic Science Fiction show with a charming and adorable British actor, that's it. I've seen worse.However, if a person wants to be technical about the show, Satan the fallen angel (or Lucifer) being cast down to earth from heaven because he rebelled against God due to pride is described in the pseudepigraphical texts 2 Enoch 29:3-4, not in the Christian canon. ","7"
"Lucifer",2016-01-26," This program is guaranteed to provoke a  religious experience  in any viewer. As you watch it, you will think to yourself  oh GOD ....could it get any worse ? I must admit that I have very LOW EXPECTATIONS for anything Fox does. But this has to be an all time low - even for Fox.The core problem is the casting of Tom Ellis as the central character. The character of Lucifer is supposed to be charming and enticing and at least mildly interesting... Mr. Ellis is none of those things. He may look like an underwear model, but he is totally lacking in charisma. He plays each scene in exactly the same way -- as if he has had far too man injections of  emotional botox . He is one of the most BLAND and unappealing Actors I have seen in the last decade.And whose idea was it to have the Devil speak with a British accent?The pilot episode, aside from the demonic character, is totally devoid of any originality. There is not one pesky new or original idea.The fact that this Stinkeroo premiered in January should indicate the very low level of confidence Fox placed in the series. ","1"
"Lucifer",2016-01-26," I can honestly say that I did not like the show. The concept seemed to be interesting but left me disappointed. These days, One of every three TV series has protagonist like Lucifer, a charming, handsome, smart-ass and kind guy, Who has a cocky way of presenting himself yet has the calmness and composure to take the correct decision. The most unbelievable thing is that characters like these are always correct. So talking about overall episode, dialog are just monotonous crap. Story is new but I am not optimistic about the way it has been put. Acting is alright, nothing we haven't seen before. Music is average. All in all, This series is average piece of junk and would be soon forgotten. I have seen shows like Da Vince's Demons, suits and this, all have same kind of lead character that sticks to your mind and that's not good. Watch it only if there is no other program on TV. ","5"
"Lucifer",2016-01-26," Satan (!) got bored with his life (!) as the lord of hell, and becomes a ...consultant (!) for the Los Angeles Police Department!!! In this depiction of the Devil himself, he is more like a modern playboy bachelor with plenty of arrogance and witty comments which constantly reveal...well...that he is the Devil! He even goes by the name Lucifer Morningstar! To tell you the truth after a while it becomes a little boring to keep revealing or remind to everyone he meets that he is  immortal  and God is his ...dad, but anyway.Additionally he is not ...such a bad guy. He feels compassion and empathy and he cares despite him declaring the opposite.There are some other characters in this. A more devilish devil than the devil (!) called Amenadiel, a confidant demon named Maze and a female detective who is immune to his charms.The premise is ludicrous and you can't take it seriously (it is basically a comedy after all) soooo the question is if is it any fun to watch...Well.. Tom Ellis does a good job so far portraying an unconventional devil. The script could have been better but it works for a TV show. I would say it has enough appeal, at least to give it a chance. ","5"
"Lucifer",2016-01-26," You can't take this anything like this seriously ! Sit back and enjoy the ride ! It's cleverly written and well acted ! It's pretty much a tongue in cheek parody. The only problem that I see with this fresh take in the devil is... All those so called critics that don't know their asses from a hole in the ground The critics can't manage a grocery list , never mind movie review.. As the wizard of of Oz said  pay no attention to that man behind the curtain (critics) There are tons of worse things to Watch on TV !! Keep an open mind and I'm quite sure that You will pleasantly be surprised. If you're even a tad bit anal , don't bother wapiti your holier than thou nasty remarks !! ","9"
"Lucifer",2016-01-25," Based on the pilot only: Lucifer  will appeal to the target audience - younger adults - as there are a bevy of good looking actors, a fast moving script, and decent music.However I found myself not quite able to buy into the premise, and those looking for a more introspective look into life may find this show wanting, or at least confusing.Some of the dialogue I found cringe-worthy and no more so than between Lucifer and his angelic opposite. The B plot, if it is the B plot, of heaven being displeased with Lucifer's little vacation in Los Angeles, really feels out of place to the A plot - that of the beautiful police detective playing hard-to-get to the devil. So the apocalyptic language from the angel seems quite strange when set against the interpersonal dialogue of the detective with Lucifer. The war-in-heaven theme is not so much a trope as it just doesn't fit with the romantic police detective story lines that I am expecting to unfold.For older viewers this will probably be skippable. Ultimately I found the pilot interesting but unsatisfying. That the characters are mostly stereotypes is what I expect in not-well-written television productions today. ","5"
"Lucifer",2015-08-27," Usually I don't give a review but now I just had to, because this show is seriously amazing! I have waited so long for something like that. I just loved the whole pilot! It was funny, exciting and the actor of Lucifer is just perfect for the role! He was dashing and gorgeous; a man you can't resist! I think this show has a lot of potential and I'm really excited for the episodes that will follow. Also I like the chemistry between Tom Ellis and Lauren German it will be interesting to see where their relationship will go. The show is exactly what I needed: something new, fresh and with a clever and smart dialog! Fantasy, Drama, Comedy a top score for me! ","10"
"Lucifer",2015-08-27," Good story! Flawless acting! Highly entertaining!The only thing that needs a bit of work is the camera-work. Delivering a line while the faces of the interlocutors are totally obscured by their passage in front of the camera is a rookie mistake. Ah, and one other thing: Why is Lucifer so obviously scared (?) of the archangel<U+0085>? It makes him less cool! If these 2 things would be taken care of, it would certainly be a 9. Adding some more philosophy to it, or making the main character more devious (or a combination), would definitely bring it to a 10.All in all, when this comes out, I'll be the first to watch it! ","8"
"Lucifer",2015-08-26," Nonsensical trash. A show about the one being in the universe who would never 'help' humanity 'helping' humanity. I don't know if there is a devil - but if there is he is the inhuman, murky, sinister, malicious incarnation of utter evil - heartless, void of pity, delighting at every infant's death and every cancer patient's cough. And here we see a charming, handsome 'hero' who...Oh, why bother? The world's utter stupidity is just not worth getting into rages over.I've had my little say. In my opinion it's like making a movie with Stalin, Mao or Hitler as the hero. ","1"
"Lucifer",2015-08-23," For some reason the main character of the comics which was a delightful sarcastic, non-sentimental, sadistic, asexual and determined entity has been transformed into a joker in this pilot(In all honesty the Hellblazer series would have needed this character more than what it has). What is with all that smile, actual humor, sentiments and an actual drive for sex from Lucifer (Ruler of Hell, and First One to have ever defied God?!?!?) By contrast the only  winged  Angel present seems more evil and determined than the above, which will definitely ignite the Christian communities, cause it actually presents Lucifer as the good guy and everybody else as the misguided flock of good-willing evildoers. That is not what made the comics great and unless the directors are aiming for a Mentalist/Supernatural blend of moonshine this will not go to far. ","3"
"Lucifer",2015-08-20," First off, I am not a comic reader, and I am coming at this with no preconceptions or bias for or against any previous works on this story line. This said, everyone knows that conversion from written/graphical works to screen (being TV or Movie) often leaves followers of such works disappointed that they have strayed from the  original  story (just keep in mind that this seems to be the case here).Overall, this pilot looks to be the best new concept show in it's class for quite a while. Great comedy, refreshing characters, and a nice twist-break from the classic  Good vs Evil  stories.The plot is interesting, if just a tad predictable, but no so much as to put me out on it. The balance of character development is just enough to raise some questions in the viewers mind as to how certain characters revealed in the pilot will mature as the show progresses, but not too much as to over saturate the characters.The pilot story leaves future story development wide open, with hints here and there to certain plot keys that may or may not be addressed in the first season. IMHO, this show is much less controversial than the organization(s)  seeking to block it, and I for one am wishing this team the best of luck with their new series. ","10"
"Lucifer",2015-08-18," The show started so strong ,, with tight plot .. and a smoothly flowing organized events >>> I am so eager to see what's gonna happen on the next episode .. New case ... new dark comedy, the humor and smug faces by Lucifer ... you literally start rooting for the devil in this one :DThe idea of the show is so fresh and original, The script is perfectly written , 4 writers so far which adds to the show the element of unpredictability and thrill .. and it looked like the screenplay was polished and edited in so many level to be spotless and having no noticeable holes.As for the cast, for shows like these picking up a British accent with a Deceptive ravishing face like Tom Ellis was a one hell of choice , and bravo for his performance so far as it shows some perfection and craftiness ,, as for the rest of cast they're all engaging and fun to watch ,, and as i'v noticed with huge possibility of a new set of characters as the crimes rolls.Since NBC has axed Constantine i'v been praying that a show will come to have that charm and attracting plot , and honestly this show appears to have a great potentials to be Fox's new Hit show ... and i only hope they just keep up the Ingenuity level we saw in the pilot.Overall ,, bravo for Fox for this clever move on Distributing this and before that on making a humongous Advertising campaign and i do hope to see it grow as the 2015 Fall Hit show :) ","8"
"Lucifer",2015-08-17," I thought the show was a hoot - Lucifer shows his imperfection even with his suave, sophisticated accent, he manages to mispronounce Mischievous as 'Mischievious'. It's funny how he actually calls himself Lucifer - I wonder if the name will catch on in the baby naming books - hopefully not. I must admit, when I first saw the title, I was not too sure I liked the idea but in reality - it's a bit of fun, not to be taken too seriously. There's a definite chemistry between Lucifer and his female cop associate but she knows how to handle him well. I think it's an OK show, so far. I guess the next episodes of the series will show if it's a keeper. ","8"
"Lucifer",2015-08-16," Without going into to much detail, I stumbled across the leaked pilot, ad gave it a shot, to my surprise, by the end of the episode my jaw was hurting from a constant smile/laugh throughout the duration of the episode. I really enjoy Tom Ellis as Satan, has a sophisticated sense of humour mixed with just enough whit and sassiness to him, whilst the supporting cast were slightly underwhelming, I believe they can hold their own if the story is directed in the right way.Whilst some moments of the episode were  Mixed for opinions.  I did overall really enjoy this, and I am looking forward to continuing watching Lucifer once the official Season starts in September. Overall Rating - 8/10 ","8"
"Lucifer",2015-08-15," This pilot is not at all close to the comic character created by Neil Gaiman in Sandman and continued by Mike Carey in the Lucifer series. In Gaiman and Carey's works, Lucifer Morningstar is a scheming, apathetic creature, bent on defying God and escaping his creation. Here he is cheerful and playful, following the detective around on this case and humoring those around him.Mazikeen of the Lilim is seen here without her patent silver mask and has a whole face. Granted, later in the comic series she does get a normal face, it is later in the series and she is not at all happy about it.Amenadiel demands that Lucifer return to Hell, but Hell should be run by the angels Remiel and Duma.All in all, if you are a fan of the comic this might not be for you. However, I do recommend you watch the pilot and decide for yourself. ","3"
"Lucifer",2015-08-15," A rare gem in a tired old genre.It would have been so easy to typecast the Devil ( the easiest type casting ever ) and not since  Bedazzled  have I seen anyone carry off a tongue in cheek, but not cheesy, portrayal as well as this.Clearly the proof of the pudding, as they say, will be in the eating. I saw enough good in the pilot starter to make me want to sit down for a main course.The acting was fine and the story did all that was required of a pilot. Hopefully this will be picked up and we can see stronger characterisation and plot development.I know some people won't like the idea of the Devil being portrayed as charming but really. If he wasn't charming who would sell their soul to him.More of this series please. ","9"
"Lucifer",2015-08-15," THEY have a plan that sounds more or less like this: let's take something with market value, buy the rights, send the whole package at our underground monkey writing lab, spin the story until devoid of any meaningful plot it becomes just another tasteless format. There you go! Now let's tease the fan base with some useless reference to what they love while carefully not scaring our formatted public with anything new or original. At this point the first obvious question would be: why bother? Production companies have hundreds of complete and developed stupid format ideas when it comes to cop shows or hospital shows, you want the single-mum detective? Got it! The drunken rough but wise cop on his road to salvation? Got it! You want the teenager cop who solves crimes in partnership with a ghost? Got it! So? Why ruin good source material to produce an awfully anonymous copy of the very same format? As it happens I have my very own conspiracy theory: they're out to buy and destroy any kind of original piece of writing which now or in the future might pose a threat to the  same-s#itty-idea  global domain, they have agents everywhere, they even start up innocent-looking production companies apparently untied to their secret organisation to acquire TV rights of everything and kill ideas in their cradle. Sounds good? I'm selling... ","1"
"Lucifer",2015-08-14," Wow, What a pilot episode!The pilot has given off a great first impression to what is to come!As played by Tom Ellis, Lucifer is a light-hearted - and sometimes insufferable - prick with a soft side for fallen angels (of the human variety) and sweet young children. There's not much danger to the character.Both actors have considerable screen presence but neither are able to fully make their characters anything other than one-dimensional: He's a funny jerk, she's his straight-laced - but not prudish - galpal.I suppose there is room for Lucifer to grow; it's unfair to judge the show's potential based on just the first episode as it has given me the impression of a cliché storyline, but this is TV land, where first impressions are crucial and the landscape is always changing in bigger, darker ways.For all his notoriety, Lucifer has a lot to prove in this playground, but for a pilot episode, it was certainly a refreshing twist! ","10"
"Lucifer",2015-08-14," Hmm, in the land down under with all our cooking shows, renovations shows and reality shows, this is a total gust of fresh hair. You have the titular character who fits the epitome of the Devil. Suave, smooth talker, snarky and getting away with it.His power of knowing a person deepest, darkest desires makes for good watching but his inability to read one person is a great hook and line.I think Tom Ellis fits into this role very well bringing across that Lucifer is the ultimate schemer and plotter.The thing that I also like in the pilot is the music in the pilot is actually quite fitting. ","9"
"Lucifer",2015-08-14," So.. just watched lucifer, and while i like the writing and the story line the acting is just horrible.The main actor is fine but man.. when the cops show up they are BADDDD.... even the main female cop (sorry didn't bother to remember their names... no point) It's like they borrowed the casting from CW to handle this. I really wish TV shows would stop casting people because they are pretty without any care if they can act.. That being said, i like the show itself and am hoping the acting becomes less stiff and flows better. P.S. whats with black angels lately? The guy in Constantine was damn good at it.. and i miss that show.. and another here... and while some people might find that question racist.. relax it's only a question.. i just don't recall black angels in my bible..BTW... another actor playing the angel that CAN'T ACT.. Cast for looks? Or someone is getting a kickback on these paychecks? ","6"
"Lucifer",2015-08-14," The kids and I watched this last night, nothing scary, pretty much PG and compared to all the other pilots out at the moment this was very good and has the most potential. We liked Tom Ellis as Lucifer, there was humour and subtle special effects as well as in your face special effects.The plot was somewhat lightweight but as an opener and for introducing the cast it was good enough, will be interested to see the overall story arc as it develops.As usual the lead actor has a British accent (though Tom was raised in Wales so should have a Welsh accent), it does work, Lucifer having an English accent and being quite classy - he hates rap but loves the Blues, a man of good tastes!I suspect the woman are going to like this even more as Tom Ellis is in constant flirt mode throughout the episode but we three blokes gave this a thumbs up and would like to see more! ","9"
"Lucifer",2015-08-13," As a fan of the supernatural, I was intrigued when I heard about Lucifer. However, seeing as I've been burned before, I started watching it with relatively low expectations. I was positively surprised by the shows' wittiness and clever dialogue. The devil is portrayed as a charming fellow who knows his way around the ladies; at least till he meets officer Chloe Dancer. His cheekiness and sarcasm makes him a breath of fresh air compared to the characters often found in supernatural shows, where the devils and demons are constantly acting as if they have a stick up their behind. Lucifer is not trying to be dark and mysterious, but fast-paced and humorous. At least that is my perception after watching the pilot. I will follow this show and hope it will continue this promising trend. ","8"
"Lucifer",2015-08-13," Well. This is my first review, for many time here and never done one, is because, this is the first time I got something worth to review. Even if English is not my mother language, I will try my best... sorry if something is misspelled or wrong written. I like complex things. And this character (religion out) is far more complex than any. I read the comics  The Sandman  and  Lucifer , and the premise is cool, considering the series is attached some how with the new issues coming from the comic. I liked the acting, specially Ellis... the girl is fine, and I like the chemistry between them. And more of it,the FX, for a TV series are cool. The script was fine, and got me (but... I knew who did it, to much TV for me, I confess. Though I will not spoil it) In the other hand, I know some people say it was overrated, but: There is a flavor for every taste... And for my taste it was awesome, delicious and brilliant. Every one is a critic, and every one can criticize, but it worth to take a look, just to know if you like it or not. And for the ones on seeing the religious way... People, there are others channels and other series to watch. That is it. Greetings from Uruguay. ","10"
"Lucifer",2015-08-13," The answer: Comedy for boring housewives. I don't wanna go deep on this I Just wanna describe this show in few sentences:1.-Lucifer is an arrogant dandy with British accent driving a convertible. 2.-Bad, bad acting. 3.-Bad, bad jokes. 4.-Producers want to fill some voids with some drama scenes. 5.-Bad FX. 6.-Excesive Night Clubbing Scenes. 7.-The  King  of the underworld looks Gayish, Oh wait a minute: Is British. I was watching my clock every minute, waiting for the show is over. It was a painful waste of time, I think this moronic series is a waste of time. In my opinion, there is not fair a good Series like  HANNIBAL  is over and this  Lucifer  program is rated with 9 points.Overrated, Overrated.Follow this show at your own risk. ","1"
"Lucifer",2015-08-13," Please I've read the moans petitions about how this glorifies Satan.. Sorry but so does Supernatural. Why do people in the US take this stuff so seriously. It a send up OK? Lucifer is witty and charming with fabulous one liners. The plot is terrible. (So are many of Supernaturals... Sorry guys) but we don't watch it for that.. if we believed every series on TV. I'd be walking around with a tin foil hat  Cos Aliens are here  Back to the Pilot.... Our British lead Tom Ellis was all suave and smooth like a very old Brandy. Whilst Lauren German was a little Ditsy but his nemesis, but in truth sexy and funny. A future partner in crime.With myself and a few hundred UK Facebook friends we can't wait for the next episode. Please.. those petitioners who wanted this banned. have you seen it? Did it make you at least chuckle? Still Nope here's a secret, Aliens have landed! ","9"
"Lucifer",2015-08-13," Losing the red horn and pitchfork for debonair skin, the titular entity roams our world with wealth and taste. Lucifer is a quirky, somewhat mischievous take on the fallen angel. It has many pop references, cool soundtracks and more importantly, a smooth convincing acting from the lead actor Tom Ellis.Far from menacing, Lucifer is a magnetic gentleman. He wears nice suits, talks in charming accent and is very manipulative. The way he is displayed here hinges a lot on persuasion. He oozes confident, able to affect others with ease but without being overly callous or arrogant. Tom Ellis just struts as though he embraces the characters, the confidence is nearly infectious.Production has all sort of nifty flair. Visual utilizes light tone, it gives more cinematic feel than most series, probably to portray the larger than life persona. Soundtracks are very good, the music is a mix of pop, rock and rap, which will resonate with audience in youthful fashion.Characters are pretty inviting, and it's not just about Lucifer himself. Supporting roles play good parts too, the female police looks sympathetic enough for long term strange partnership, almost in odd buddy cop gimmick. It leaves many possibilities for future episodes, maybe it ventures into case of the week or just expanding on how manipulative Lucifer can be without becoming too sinister for silver screen.Not sure how long Lucifer will walk the TV or how he will maintain the nature of the series in the long run, but as far as introduction goes, it is done with great taste. Fascinatingly classy and with a touch of devilry, please give Lucifer the courtesy of your viewing. ","8"
"Lucifer",2015-08-13," I started watching the pilot with great expectations as the title of the show itself seemed pretty intimidating to me. I will draw out later whether I was satisfied or not. I'd like to start with the aspect that impressed me most of all: the soundtracks. All the tracks from the very beginning of the pilot created perfectly suitable atmosphere. In my opinion, soundtracks also successfully serve the purpose of outlining the main character's nature. The plot, alongside with the title of the show, may seem quite provoking to some audiences. However, even though I expected Lucifer to be an absolutely positive character, script writers seem not to have forgotten sadistic nature of the Devil. This earned extra stars for the show from me. However, several plot holes did not let me rate 10/10. What seemed to be the most annoying one for me was the fact that Lucifer knows everything about our pop culture ( Taken  and other movie references, knowing the names of celebrities), however, he seems to be unfamiliar to the way movies are shot (Gray Cooper scene). Another important aspect I would like to outline is acting, which is, I must say, extraordinary. To sum up, the show lived up to my expectations. Recommendation: watch it! ","9"
"Lucifer",2015-08-12," This is utter garbage. I had to stop watching which, considering it is a pilot, is really bad. The concept sounded very interesting, a kind of  Devil's Advocate . Instead, what I got was seriously bad acting. The actors were just trying to hard, in fact, the whole episode just felt desperate.I watch a lot of shows and have sat through some pretty awful ones, but this was the worst pilot I've seen in years. Instead of Lucifer, you get the typical spoiled brat vibe. ......I don't care what daddy says, I want to stay here and be naughty.....The current rating at the time of writing this is 9.0. There is no way in hell this will stay there, I imagine it will drop to below 7 by the time the masses view this pilot.... ","3"
